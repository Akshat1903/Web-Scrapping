Questions,Answer
Why do people need vaccines? What is immunization? What is immunity?,"'Vaccines'' are medications that boost our ability to fight off certain diseases. Many of the vaccine-preventable diseases are highly ''contagious'' and even fatal in non-immunized individuals (Table 1). Prior to the development of ''vaccines'', these diseases disabled or killed millions of people. Many people living in developed countries today do not appreciate the value of immunizations because the successful use of vaccines has almost eradicated many of these diseases. These diseases are still dangerous and can kill people who are not adequately protected from them.''Immunization is the act of receiving a vaccine. Immunity is the ability of the body to recognize specific infecting organisms as foreign and thereby protect against them.' "
How can people become immune (protected)?,"'Immunity (protection) can occur one of two ways:' Active immunityThe first way to become immune is by actually getting the natural disease. For many organisms, this confers immunity for life. When the person is exposed again to the organism, the immune system quickly reestablishes protection.The second way to become immune is through the use of a vaccine. The vaccine interacts with the immune system and creates the same protection as if the person had the natural infections. This is done without being exposed to the risks involved with getting the natural infection. The first way to become immune is by actually getting the natural disease.

This only lasts for a period of months, and this is why newborns need to start receiving immunizations shortly after birth.For some diseases, there are shots that contain antibodies against some diseases (immune globulin). Examples of diseases for which we have immune globulin include rabies and hepatitis. Newborn babies receive immunity from their mothers.

Are there different types of vaccines?,"'There are two major categories of vaccines.' The first category of vaccine is made from live viruses that have been ""attenuated"" or weakened so that they do not cause the disease (Table 2). Usually, any symptoms caused by the vaccine is milder than the natural disease. The attenuated viruses elicit a strong immune response as the virus is very close to the virus that causes the disease. The second category of vaccine, inactivated vaccine, is produced by growing the bacterium or virus in culture and then inactivating it (killing it) by using heat or chemicals (Table 3). These vaccines cannot cause the disease, but allow the body to develop immunity. While these vaccines are safer, they do not produce protection as good as that from the live vaccines."
Can people receive multiple vaccinations during one visit to the doctor?,"'Simultaneous administration (vaccines given at the same visit but not in the same shot) of most commonly used vaccines does not decrease the response to the vaccines or increase the risk for adverse reactions. The simultaneous administration of vaccines was instituted to increase compliance with recommended immunization schedules. If people have to come back many times to get additional shots, there is an increased chance that they will not get all recommended ''vaccinations''. In children, there are now a few combination shots that contain multiple vaccines in a single shot. Most of these are approved for use in adults, except Tdap (a three-vaccine combination) and one containing ''measles''/''mumps''/''rubella'' (MMR). There is an ongoing controversy in the public media about giving ""too many"" vaccines at one time to little children. Physicians, however, do not believe that children are at risk from ""too many"" vaccinations given at one time.' "
Are there any dangers to being immunized?,"'There is no such thing as a risk-free vaccine. However, the health risk of not being vaccinated is real and is clearly greater than that of being vaccinated. Most side effects from vaccinations are mild and limited to local reactions at the injection site and/or a mild ''fever''. Unfortunately, there are rare serious and even fatal side effects related to vaccines. While these events are sad, not taking the vaccine could also result in death or disability.' "
Can people with severe egg allergies still get an annual influenza vaccination?,"'In December 2017, the American College of ''Allergy'', ''Asthma'', and Immunology published an updated guideline and recommended that patients with egg ''allergy'' receive the ''influenza'' vaccine. Even though the vaccine is currently manufactured in eggs, there is only minimal egg protein in the vaccine. There is no increased risk of reaction in patients with egg ''allergy''.''With this new recommendation to utilize the routine influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy, there is no need to utilize the egg-free vaccine that was released in 2013. Therefore, although the recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) is not made using eggs, it is no longer needed.' "
What reactions are likely after an immunization?,"'Most reactions to vaccines are mild and self-limited. These are usually limited ''pain'', swelling, and redness at the site of the vaccination. These occur in up to 80% of individuals and start within hours of the vaccination. Some people can get more generalized symptoms, including ''fever'', muscle aches, ''headache'', ''loss of appetite'', and feeling generally tired. These systemic (generalized) reactions are seen more commonly with live attenuated vaccines and usually occur seven to 21 days after the vaccine was given. The worst (and very uncommon) reaction is ''anaphylaxis'' (a ''severe allergic reaction''). These reactions usually occur shortly after the vaccine is given and can be life-threatening. Fortunately, these reactions only occur two times for every million doses of vaccine given.' "
Who should not receive a vaccine?,"'There are two types of contraindications (reasons not to give a vaccine): permanent and temporary.'  The following are permanent contraindications to vaccination:severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component (animal proteins [eggs], antibiotic, stabilizer, or preservative) or following a previous dose of the vaccine;encephalopathy within seven days of a pertussis vaccination (not from another identifiable cause). This reaction is very rare since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine. severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component (animal proteins [eggs], antibiotic, stabilizer, or preservative) or following a previous dose of the vaccine; encephalopathy within seven days of a pertussis vaccination (not from another identifiable cause). This reaction is very rare since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine. The following are precautions/temporary contraindications to vaccination:Pregnancy: Although the risk of vaccination during pregnancy is mostly theoretical, caution is advised. Therefore, women who are known to be pregnant should not receive any of the live vaccines (Table 2). Inactivated vaccines are considered generally safe during pregnancy and should be used when indicated (Table 3). See the guide from the U.S. CDC for a complete listing of approved vaccines during pregnancy.Immunosuppression: People with active cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma (or people taking high doses of steroids) should not receive live vaccines but can receive inactivated vaccines.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): Vaccination depends on the severity of the illness. In asymptomatic (without symptoms) individuals, many vaccines are considered safe. In general, the inactivated vaccines are safe for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with HIV.Moderate to severe illness: If someone is ill with more than a simple cold, earache, diarrhea, or other minor illness, vaccination should be postponed until the illness is over. Pregnancy: Although the risk of vaccination during pregnancy is mostly theoretical, caution is advised. Therefore, women who are known to be pregnant should not receive any of the live vaccines (Table 2). Inactivated vaccines are considered generally safe during pregnancy and should be used when indicated (Table 3). See the guide from the U.S. CDC for a complete listing of approved vaccines during pregnancy.

In general, the inactivated vaccines are safe for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with HIV. Moderate to severe illness: If someone is ill with more than a simple cold, earache, diarrhea, or other minor illness, vaccination should be postponed until the illness is over."
What vaccines can women receive while pregnant?,"'Women who are pregnant should not receive the MMR, oral typhoid ''yellow fever'', ''varicella'', or zoster vaccines. These vaccines are made from live attenuated viruses and potentially could cause a problem. Pregnant women may receive ''tetanus'' and influenza vaccines as needed. It is safe to receive ''hepatitis A'' & B, meningococcal, and pneumococcal vaccines.' "
What are invalid reasons for postponing vaccination?,"'Vaccination should not be postponed for any of the following reasons:' Mild illness: Low-grade fever, colds, upper respiratory-tract infections, and mild diarrhea are not reasons to put off vaccination. Antibiotics: The current administration of antibiotics is not a reason to put off vaccination. Household contacts of pregnant women or immunosuppressed patients: Living in a house with a pregnant woman or an immunosuppressed patient is not a reason to put off vaccination. Two exceptions are the live attenuated nasal influenza vaccine (which should no loner be used for anyone due to its lack of efficacy) and smallpox vaccine. Breastfeeding: Breastfeeding is not a reason for either the mother or baby to put off vaccination. Preterm birth: Preterm birth is not a reason to put off vaccination. Generalized allergies: Children with allergies, but no history of reactions to vaccine components, should receive vaccines as recommended. Family history: Having a family member who had an adverse reaction to a vaccine is not a reason to put off vaccination."
Are side effects associated with vaccines?,"'The side effects of most vaccines are mild and go away with in a few days. Common side effects of many vaccines include soreness at the injection site, low-grade fever, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', and muscle aches. However, some vaccines can have serious or even life-threatening reactions. Thousands of lives are saved for every serious side effect that is caused. The specific side effects of specific vaccines are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm.' "
Why do people keep getting vaccines if the numbers of cases of the vaccine preventable diseases are at a record low in the United States?,"'Vaccine-preventable diseases are indeed infrequent in the United States because of the success of the vaccine program. However, if people stop receiving vaccines, these diseases will come back rapidly. This occurred with ''measles'' in the early 1990s and resulted in many deaths.' "
What should people do if they experience a reaction to a vaccine?,"'If the reaction is a mild reaction with just some injection-site tenderness, low-grade fever, ''fatigue'' and ''headache'', then simply taking a dose or two of ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') may be helpful. The use of ''ibuprofen'' or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' has been discouraged because of the concern that these drugs might decrease the immune response after the vaccine (make the vaccine less effective). Studies are still ongoing at this time. It is best to check with the physician who ordered the vaccine if you are concerned about the symptoms or you want to take something for the symptoms.''If you think you are having a serious side effect, consult your physician immediately. If a person is seriously injured by a vaccine, there is available compensation through the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.' "
Is there any financial help for people who have been seriously injured by vaccines?,"'In 1986, the United States government set up the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. This act provides a ""no fault"" compensation mechanism for people injured by vaccines.' "
Is there anything different that health care workers need to do compared with non-health care workers?,"'Health care workers are treated a little differently than other adults for two reasons. First, a health care worker is more likely to be exposed to certain risks of infection (such as ''hepatitis B'') than the normal population. Second, if a health care worker becomes infected, they may transmit those infections to their patients (''chickenpox'', pertussis).' Tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (Td/Tdap)It is recommended that any health care worker who may have patient contact receive a Tdap shot if they have not received one as an adolescent (as long as it has been two years since their last Td shot). This helps prevent the spread of pertussis. It is recommended that any health care worker who may have patient contact receive a Tdap shot if they have not received one as an adolescent (as long as it has been two years since their last Td shot). This helps prevent the spread of pertussis. Hepatitis BHealth care workers who have not been vaccinated should receive the three-dose series and obtain anti-hepatitis B serology testing one to two months after their third dose. Health care workers who have not been vaccinated should receive the three-dose series and obtain anti-hepatitis B serology testing one to two months after their third dose. Measles/mumps/rubella (MMR)There must be either documented evidence of all three diseases (measles, mumps, and rubella) or serologic evidence of immunity (determined by a blood test) in anyone born after 1957. If there is no serologic evidence of immunity, the health care worker should receive two doses of MMR separated by 28 days or more. There must be either documented evidence of all three diseases (measles, mumps, and rubella) or serologic evidence of immunity (determined by a blood test) in anyone born after 1957. If there is no serologic evidence of immunity, the health care worker should receive two doses of MMR separated by 28 days or more. VaricellaAll health care workers must have a history of varicella disease (chickenpox), prior vaccination, or serologic evidence of immunity. If not, the worker should receive two doses of vaccine 28 days apart. All health care workers must have a history of varicella disease (chickenpox), prior vaccination, or serologic evidence of immunity. If not, the worker should receive two doses of vaccine 28 days apart. InfluenzaHealth care workers should receive one dose of the flu shot annually. Health care workers should receive one dose of the flu shot annually."
Do people need any additional vaccinations for foreign travel?,"'There are a number of vaccines that are not routinely given in the U.S. that are recommended for foreign travel. Which vaccines a person needs completely depends on the country to which he or she is traveling. The CDC has a web site that is constantly updated with recommendations for vaccines (''https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/''). People can learn about recommended vaccines by simply navigating to the country they plan to visit. These vaccines can then be obtained from many local health departments or travel clinics.''Travelers'' going to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America are required by International Health Regulations to have ''yellow fever'' vaccination. All other vaccines are simply recommended to protect the ''traveler''. Common vaccines given for foreign travel include ''hepatitis A vaccine'', ''hepatitis B vaccine'', and typhoid vaccine. U.S. citizens who have not received their recommended (routine) vaccinations (Tdap, MMR, ''polio'', etc.) should make sure that they get all routinely recommended vaccines before traveling. Many of these diseases are still very common in other parts of the world. For instance, people going to Mecca on the Haj are required to be vaccinated against meningitis.' "
Is there an influenza (flu) vaccine that can be given in the nose instead of a shot?,"'Until 2017, there was an influenza vaccine that could be given as a spray in the nose. This vaccine is no longer available because it simply did not work as well as the shot.' "
Where can people find additional information on immunizations?, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web site for vaccines and immunizations at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html.

Facts you should know about the influenza vaccine (flu shot)," Types of influenza (flu) vaccines include the injection (killed virus), recombinant (made without flu virus), and nasal spray vaccines (containing live virus). Each year, influenza viruses change slightly, making the seasonal vaccine used in previous years ineffective. The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation in the community. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the vaccine effectiveness."
What is influenza (flu)?,"'The flu (or common flu) is a viral infection that spreads from person to person in secretions of the nose and ''lungs'', for example when ''sneezing''. Medically, the common flu is another name for influenza. Flu is a ''respiratory infection'', that is, an infection that develops primarily in the lungs. People often call respiratory infections caused by other viruses the flu, but this is incorrect. These other infections are usually categorized as URIs (upper respiratory infections) and have multiple causes. Influenza usually causes higher ''fever'', more malaise, and severe body aches than other respiratory infections. Although other viruses may cause these ''flu-like symptoms'', they do so less frequently.''Influenza viruses are divided scientifically into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. ''Type A'' viruses are divided into subtypes and are named based on differences in two viral surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes.''The flu is a common illness. The CDC reports for the 2018/2019 influenza season show that in the United States''The so-called ''swine flu'' pandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel influenza A virus designated ''H1N1'' based upon its surface protein types. This virus was originally referred to as swine flu because many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. However, this virus was actually quite different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs.' 5%-20% of the population gets the flu, nearly 500,000 people are hospitalized from flu-related complications, about 34,000 people die from the flu or its complications."
Why vaccinate for the flu?,"'The flu is highly infectious and is a potentially serious viral ''respiratory infection'' that can even be life threatening. Whereas with other viral respiratory infections the symptoms usually are mild and most people can continue working or going to school while ill, with the flu, the symptoms are severe and prolonged and cause individuals to miss days of work or school. The infection stresses the body. In addition, superinfections may occur as a complication of the flu. Superinfections are ''bacterial infections'' that occur on top of a respiratory infection. Bacterial respiratory infections also are a serious type of infection, and the simultaneous viral and bacterial infection can overwhelm the function of the lungs and the body. Among the elderly and the very young, it can cause death. Because of its infectiousness, morbidity (severity of symptoms and time lost from work or school), and the potential for death, it is important to prevent the flu by influenza vaccination. Although there are medications to treat the flu, they are expensive, not as effective as influenza vaccination, and need to be started within 24-48 hours of the start of symptoms.'  "
What are the different types of flu vaccines?,"'Flu ''vaccines'' are routinely available for seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccines may also be developed for specific strains of the flu virus that cause widespread disease, such as occurred with the H1N1 virus in 2009.''Each year, composition of the influenza viruses changes, making the vaccine used in previous years ineffective. Each year, a new vaccine must be prepared that will be effective against the types of influenza virus that are expected to circulate in the upcoming influenza season. These are known as seasonal flu vaccines. The reason for the differences in circulating strains of the flu virus is that the virus can mutate (or change its structure) rapidly, leading to new subtypes of the virus. The key is to be able to predict which influenza viruses are going to cause infection and to prepare a vaccine against those viruses. Usually, scientists can predict accurately which types of influenza virus will cause infections and prepare an appropriate vaccine. Typically, the viruses used to prepare flu vaccine are grown in eggs, but a newer, egg-free version of the vaccine has been developed. In 2017, updated guidelines from the Influenza Vaccine and Egg ''Allergy'' Practice Parameter Workgroup commissioned by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) stated that the risk is so small that even asking patients about egg ''allergy'' is no longer necessary. Health care professionals can now safely administer flu vaccines to people who are ''allergic'' to eggs. Flu viruses may also be made using recombinant technology that does not involve growing the actual flu virus in eggs.''The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. These strains vary from flu season to flu season each year. This is the reason that revaccination is required annually with the vaccine that matches the strains of influenza that are currently prevalent.''Flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, meaning that it contains killed influenza virus, or a recombinant vaccine, meaning that it was made without using virus particles at all. Health care providers inject the vaccine into muscles or skin, stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response (antibodies) to the influenza virus.''Medical professionals administer the ""flu shot"" vaccine as a single dose of liquid injected through the skin into muscle (intramuscular or IM). Typically, health care professionals inject the flu vaccine into the deltoid muscle at the side of the arm, using ''alcohol'' rubbed over the skin for sterilization. Health care professionals administer the vaccine annually, each fall. Side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon.''Two types of vaccines are available: a trivalent vaccine that targets three strains of flu virus, as well as a quadrivalent vaccine that targets four strains. Both the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are available as an intramuscular injection. Special vaccines preparations are available for people over 65 years of age that produce a stronger immune response.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the use of injectable influenza vaccines (either trivalent or quadrivalent, including inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines) or the nasal spray vaccine for the influenza season of 2019-20.''The nasal-spray flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for live attenuated influenza vaccine, brand name ''FluMist'') was first licensed in 2003. It is directed against the same strains of virus as the flu shot but differs in that it contains weakened live influenza viruses instead of killed viruses and is administered by nasal spray instead of injection. The vaccine is termed an attenuated vaccine because the vaccine viruses are weakened so that they themselves do not cause severe ''flu symptoms''. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-''pregnant'' individuals 2-49 years old. It should not be used for people with certain underlying medical conditions. All LAIV are quadrivalent (four-component).''The live viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened so that they do not cause severe symptoms. However, mild symptoms can occur as a side effect of the vaccination. Side effects of the nasal-spray flu vaccine can includedrunny nose, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and ''cough''. Children who receive the vaccine may also develop mild ''fever'' and muscle aches.' "
What flu viruses does the flu vaccine protect against?,"'Flu vaccines are developed each year and are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be the most common during the upcoming season. Some vaccines contain three viral strains (trivalent), while others contain four virus types (quadrivalent).' "
How does the flu vaccine work to prevent the flu?,"'The flu vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce of antibodies in the body that fight the particular flu virus in the vaccination. When the virus enters a vaccinated person, the antibodies attack and kill the virus and prevent infection. Antibodies are produced against the specific strains of the virus contained in the yearly vaccine.''Flu vaccination does not protect against infection caused by microbes other than the influenza virus.' "
Will the flu vaccine help fight the coronavirus?,"'The coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) and influenza are two different illnesses caused by different viruses. The flu shot will not help fight coronavirus infection, but getting a flu shot remains an important step in protecting your health and in reducing the overall burden of respiratory illness in the community. Having enough people vaccinated against the flu ensures that hospitals and clinics keep adequate space to treat patients with coronavirus infections. It is expected that both the coronavirus and the flu may be present at the same time in the 2020-21 flu season, and being vaccinated against the flu helps protect yourself and vulnerable populations against an illness that might happen at the same time as a coronavirus infection.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'According to the CDC, ""While it\'s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter (of 2020-21), CDC believes it\'s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes ''COVID-19'' will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever."" There is no evidence to suggest that it is not possible to have both diseases at the same time.' "
Is it safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu vaccine?,"'There is no coronavirus vaccine currently available, but vaccine developers are working to ensure development of a vaccine that is safe for everyone, including those who have had flu shots. Currently in the absence of a coronavirus vaccine, it is especially important for the 2020-21 flu season to receive a flu shot for its overall health benefits.' "
When should one receive the flu vaccine?,'Health care professionals recommend getting the influenza vaccination before flu season begins in your community. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to produce a sufficient antibody response against the flu. Flu season can begin in October and last as late as May.' 
Who should receive the flu vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends that every individual over 6 months of age receive the seasonal flu vaccine. While everyone should get a vaccination, it is particularly important for some groups. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu, such as those with ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', and chronic lung disease as well as pregnant women and those over 65 years of age. It is also important for caregivers to get ''vaccinations'', in addition to those who live with people in these risk groups.' "
Who should not receive the flu vaccine?,"'Those who should avoid the flu vaccine include the following:' People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine People with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS) that occurred after receiving influenza vaccine and who are not at risk for severe illness from influenza should generally not receive vaccine. People under 65 years of age should not receive the high-dose flu shot. If you are sick with a fever when you go to get your flu shot, you should talk to your doctor or nurse about whether or not you should get your shot later. However, you can get a flu shot at the same time you have a respiratory illness without fever or if you have another mild illness."
What are flu vaccine risks and side effects? Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?,"'Serious side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon. Side effects of the injection vaccine include soreness at the site of the injection, muscle aching, fever, and feeling unwell. Very rarely, people have reported serious allergic reactions. The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms; they cannot cause you to get the flu. Side effects from the nasal spray may include ''runny nose'', mild fever, ''sore throat'', ''cough'', muscle aches, ''headache'', and ''vomiting''.''Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an illness characterized by fever, nerve damage, and muscle ''weakness''. In 1976, vaccination with the swine flu vaccine was associated with development of GBS. Studies have evaluated if other flu vaccines were associated with GBS, with only one of the studies showing an association. That single study suggested that one person out of 1 million vaccinated people may be at risk of GBS associated with the vaccine.'

What should I do about adverse reactions to the flu vaccine?,'You should contact your health care professional in the case of any serious side effects. Mild side effects such as soreness at the injection site typically resolve on their own without treatment.' 
How effective is the flu vaccine (flu shot)?,"'The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40%-60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are similar to those used in the vaccines. Similar reductions in the number of people hospitalized with the flu have also been observed. Rates of flu prevention may be even higher in healthy adults under 65 years of age.' "
What was the novel H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine?,"'The H1N1 vaccine was a pandemic vaccine designed to provide immunity against the novel H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, initially referred to as swine flu. Initially, health care providers gave the H1N1 vaccine to those at highest risk for complications of this illness (children, pregnant women, caregivers of children). Even though the virus proved not to be as deadly as expected, researchers suggest the H1N1 vaccine was effective in reducing the effects of this flu virus.' "
What is the best way to locate a flu vaccine clinic?,"""People can obtain flu shots through a health care professional's office, at community health departments, and at many pharmacies. Additionally, many employers and schools host flu shot clinics. Some employers may offer the vaccine free of charge. A health care professional's office should be able to provide information about flu shot clinics available in the community."" "
What is pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination is a method of preventing a specific type of lung infection (''pneumonia'') that is caused by the pneumococcus (''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'') bacterium. There are more than 80 different types of pneumococcus bacteria -- 23 of them covered by the ''vaccine''. The vaccine is injected into the body to stimulate the normal immune system to produce antibodies that are directed against pneumococcus bacteria.''This method of stimulating the normal immune system to be directed against a specific microbe is called immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination is also referred to as pneumococcal immunization.''Pneumococcal vaccination does not protect against ''pneumonia'' caused by microbes other than pneumococcus bacteria, nor does it protect against pneumococcal bacterial ''strains'' not included in the vaccine. It is reassuring to note that of the 80 different serotypes, the vast majority of infections are caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine.''In children, especially under 2 years of age, a special conjugated vaccine has been developed to stimulate less developed immune systems. Originally only covering seven serotypes, the newer vaccine released in 2010 now covers 13 serotypes of the pneumococcus (''Prevnar 13'').' "
Who should consider pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered by people in the following groups:' Adults 65 years of age and older People > 2 years of age with chronic heart or lung disorders, including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, alcoholism, spinal fluid leaks, cardiomyopathy, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or emphysema People > 2 years of age with spleen dysfunction (such as sickle cell disease) or lack of spleen function (asplenia), blood malignancy (leukemias), multiple myeloma, kidney failure, organ transplantation, or immunosuppressive conditions, including HIV infection Alaskan natives and certain American Indian populations If elective surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or immunosuppressive therapy is planned, the vaccine is given two weeks prior to the procedure, if possible."
Who should not receive pneumococcal vaccine? What about pregnancy?,"'The ''pneumococcal vaccine'' should not be received by people with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine.''The safety of the pneumococcus vaccine for ''pregnant'' women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before ''becoming pregnant'', if possible.' "
What are side effects of pneumococcal vaccine?,"'Pneumococcal vaccine uncommonly causes side effects. Reported side effects include''The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', ''chills'', and diffuse achiness.'   soreness and/or redness at the site of the injection, fever, rash, and allergic reactions."
How is pneumococcal vaccine administered?,"'The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a single injection in adults. The vaccine is injected as a liquid solution of 0.5 mL into the muscle (intramuscular or IM), typically deltoid muscle, or under the skin (subcutaneous or SC). The area injected is typically disinfected by rubbing ''alcohol'' onto the skin prior to the injection. The conjugated Prevnar 13 vaccine is given as a series of four injections in children.''People vaccinated prior to age 65 should be vaccinated at age 65 if five or more years have passed since the first dose. For people with a lack of spleen function (such as in sickle cell disease or after spleen removal), transplant patients, patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', immunosuppressed or immunodeficient people, and others at highest risk of fatal infection, a second dose should be given at least five years after first dose.' "
What if it is not clear what a person's vaccination history is?,"'When indicated, ''vaccines'' should be administered to patients with unknown vaccination status. All residents of ''nursing'' homes and other long-term care facilities should have their vaccination status assessed and documented.''Inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine and ''tetanus'' ''vaccines'' may be given at the same time as or at any time before or after a dose of pneumococcus vaccine. There are no requirements to wait between the doses of these or any other inactivated ''vaccines''.''In July 2000, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and the CDC jointly recommended childhood pneumococcal immunization, since pneumococcal infections are the most common invasive ''bacterial infections'' in children in the United States.''""The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, all adults 65 years or older, and persons 6 through 64 years of age with certain medical conditions,"" according to the 2014 AAP/CDC guidelines. ""Pneumovax is a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) that is currently recommended for use in all adults 65 years of age or older and for persons who are 2 years and older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, ''HIV'' infection, or other immunocompromising conditions). PPSV23 is also recommended for use in adults 19 through 64 years of age who smoke cigarettes or who have ''asthma''.""' "
What are the current recommendations for administration of pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adults?,"   Patients who are healthy and have never received the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine (PPSV23), if equal to or older than 65 years of age, should receive the PCV13 first and then within six months to a one year receive the PPSV23. Those who have already received the PPSV23, should get the PCV13 about one year later. If the person received the PPSV23 over five years earlier, they essentially should be treated as if they never received the vaccine, getting the PCV13 injection, followed about six to 13 months later by the PPSV23. In general, there seems to be a better immune response to the overlapping 13 strains of pneumococcus if the PCV13 is received first. The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, chills, and diffuse achiness."
What are vaccine-preventable diseases?,"'Vaccine''-preventable diseases are those diseases for which there is a shot that helps the immune system prepare for an infection. A person develops immunity after he or she has received a vaccine and responded to it. When a vaccinated person is exposed to a virus (for example, ''hepatitis B'') or bacteria (for example, ''diphtheria''), his or her body is able to destroy the virus or bacteria and prevent the disease. No vaccine is perfect, and some people who receive a vaccine can still get the disease. This is why it is important for everyone to get the vaccine. This gives the community what experts call ""herd"" immunity and means that, basically, there are very few people who could serve as a reservoir for the disease. Herd immunity prevents severe outbreaks of diseases.''The following table lists vaccine-preventable diseases:' "
What is the vaccination schedule for adolescents?, 
What is the vaccination schedule for adults?, 
What vaccines should a pregnant woman get?,"'The concerns surrounding the dangers of ''vaccines'' during ''pregnancy'' is mostly theoretical. The concern is related to the risk of transfer to the fetus. There is no evidence of any risk associated with the use of inactivated (killed) ''vaccines'' in ''pregnant'' women. The biggest concern is related to the use of live vaccines. While the risk is extremely low, the concern is that the live virus will be transferred from the mother to the fetus. There must be a discussion between the physician and the mother whenever a live vaccine is considered during pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) has issued a guide to help expectant mothers and physicians make good decisions related to the risk and benefits of using a vaccine during pregnancy (''https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html''). ''Tetanus''-''diphtheria'' with acellular ''pertussis'' (Tdap) vaccine, ''hepatitis A'', ''hepatitis B vaccine'', ''meningococcal vaccine'', and ''rabies'' vaccine are generally considered safe during pregnancy. It is currently recommended that pregnant women ''not'' receive the following vaccines: ''human papillomavirus'', live nasal ''influenza'' vaccine (no longer recommended for anyone due to lack of efficacy), ''measles'', ''mumps'', ''rubella'', ''varicella'', and zoster.' "
Do health care workers need any different vaccines?,"'It is very important that health care workers are up to date on all of their required vaccines. Additionally, the CDC recommends that health care workers receive varicella (''chickenpox'') vaccine unless there is proof of immunity, prior vaccination, or documented history of the disease. Also, health care workers with direct patient contact, who have not previously received a ''pertussis''-containing ''tetanus'' shot (Tdap), are required to receive one dose. For the complete recommendations, please consult the CDC web site at ''https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html''. Health care workers are required by most employers to have ''hepatitis B'' vaccination and annual influenza vaccinations.' "
What types of specialists administer vaccinations to adolescents and adults?,"'Any licensed physician can order all approved vaccines. Many public-health departments also offer vaccination services at a reduced price. Vaccines are commonly administered by primary care providers, including pediatricians, family practitioners, and internists.' "
"What is the Td/Tdap vaccine, and who should receive it?","'The Td and Tdap vaccines both contain vaccines against tetanus (''lockjaw'') and diphtheria. The Tdap also contains a vaccine against pertussis (''whooping cough''). Most adults are used to getting a tetanus shot when they get a cut. Up until 2005, adolescents and adults were not recommended to receive the pertussis vaccine due to an unacceptable rate of negative reactions. In 2005, a new acellular pertussis vaccine became available for both children and adults (although there are different ones for each group using different amounts of each vaccine). ''Whooping cough'' has become a serious problem again due to the lack of vaccination in adolescents and adults. It is therefore recommended that all adolescents and adults receive at least one dose of Tdap when they are due for their next tetanus shot. Health care workers should get one Tdap vaccination as soon as possible but at least two years since the last tetanus shot (Td).' "
"What is the HPV vaccine, and who should get 
it?","'Human papillomavirus (''HPV'') infection is the cause of ''cervical cancer'' and ''vaginal cancer'' in women, ''penile cancer'' in men, and throat and ''anal cancer'' in both men and women. There are over 100 different types of ''HPV'', and two ''strains'', HPV 16 and 18, are the types that cause about 66% of cervical ''cancers'' and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. The ''Gardasil''-9 vaccine available in the U.S. protects against nine types of HPV -- the four contained in the original Gardasil vaccine (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), plus five additional strains (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).''Studies have shown that use of the vaccine will decrease the chance that a woman will get ''cervical cancer''. As such, the vaccine must be given before the first sexual contact. The CDC recommends that all girls and boys receive the three-shot series beginning at 11 years of age. Boys need vaccination in order to prevent spread to girls and to protect against cancers of the anus, mouth/throat (oropharynx), and penis. Adult women who have not received the vaccine should do so up to 26 years of age. After 26 years of age, it is believed that most women would have been exposed to the virus and the vaccine would be of no use.''If a person receives the vaccine before age 15 and is going to receive the Gardasil 9, it is a two-shot series; however, if the vaccine is not received until after the 15th birthday or if the series was begun using an earlier version of the Gardasil vaccine or the discontinued Cervarix vaccine, it is recommended that they receive a three-shot series.' "
"What is the meningococcal vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Meningococcal disease is a serious acute illness caused by a bacterium. Those infected can develop meningitis and ''sepsis'', and these are often fatal diseases. There are two different quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY, MPSV4). A newer vaccine (Bexsero or Trumenba) against meningococcal serogroup B is also now available and should be given to high-risk individuals, with the injection given at the same time as the quadrivalent vaccine but at a different body site. The disease is more common in adolescents and college students. Therefore, meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all children between 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years of age. If the child has not received the vaccine by 11-12 years of age, they should receive it up to age 18. College freshmen who have not received the vaccine should be vaccinated. The vaccines are also recommended for adults with special medical conditions.''In 2017, the CDC changed their recommendation for people age 16 to 23 to now receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (MenB) (Bexsero or Trumenba). It has not been mandated, but doctors are recommended to consider the serogroup B vaccine in this age group. Additionally, if there are any outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease on a college campus, the CDC recommends the use of serogroup B meningococcal vaccines (Bexsero or Trumenba).' "
"What is the MMR vaccine, and who should receive it?","'The MMR vaccine contains vaccines against the diseases ''measles'', mumps, and ''rubella'' (''German measles''). These are all dangerous and potentially fatal diseases that have been successfully limited in the United States through aggressive vaccine programs. Adolescents and adults who have not received the MMR or MMRV (MMR, plus the varicella vaccine) should receive two doses of the vaccine at least one month apart. People who do not have medical documentation of having had the diseases or cannot prove previous vaccination should have titers (blood tests to check levels of immunity) drawn to make sure they are immune to these agents. If they do not have laboratory evidence of immunity, they should receive a two-dose series of vaccine.' "
"What is the varicella vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Varicella is the virus that causes ''chickenpox''. While the disease is usually self-limited, it can cause death and permanent injury. The groups at greatest risk are infants, people over 15 years of age, and immunocompromised people. The vaccine came out in the mid-1990s and unfortunately does not offer complete protection, but even those who get the disease after vaccination have a milder form of the condition. Prior to use of the vaccine, hundreds of children died every year from chickenpox. It is recommended that all adolescents and adults without documented evidence of chickenpox or previous vaccination receive the two-dose series.' "
"What is 
the pneumococcal vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'' (also called pneumococcus) is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and ''pneumonia''. The vaccine is routinely given to children; however, it is only given to adolescents and adults who are at higher risk (patients with chronic diseases like ''heart disease'' and ''diabetes'', immunocompromised individuals, ''smokers'', and asthmatics). Elderly adults are one group that is considered at higher risk, and it is recommended that all adults aged 65 or older receive both available vaccines, PCV13 followed by PPSV23 (PCV13–PPSV23 sequence). The new recommendation for 2016 is that the vaccines be spaced over one year apart for immunocompetent adults aged 65 or older.' "
"What is the influenza vaccine, and who 
should receive it?","'Influenza (''flu'') is an acute viral illness that can kill even healthy people. Unfortunately, the influenza virus changes a little each year, and scientists have to make educated guesses about which forms of the virus will be infecting people and circulating each year. Based on the best available evidence, they create a vaccine each year containing three of the likely influenza virus types.''The annual ''flu vaccine'' is an inactivated vaccine (shot). You cannot get the flu from getting the ''flu shot'' because it has inactivated virus (virus killed with heat or chemicals). The immunity from the vaccines is limited, and vaccinations must be repeated yearly. It is recommended that all people older than 6 months of age receive an annual vaccination. In 2017, the American College of ''Allergy'', ''Asthma'', and Immunology changed their guidance for patients with egg ''allergy''. They no longer recommend that doctors screen for egg ''allergy'' prior to administering the flu shot, and they recommend that patients with egg allergy receive the currently available flu shot even though it has been created in eggs. There is only minimal egg protein in the shot, and there is no increased risk of reaction for patients with egg allergy. There is also a vaccine recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) that contains no egg protein because it is not manufactured with eggs. Although the CDC encourages that any adult who wants to decrease the chance of getting the flu get the influenza vaccine, certain high-risk groups are recommended to always get the annual flu vaccine. Adults over 50 years of age are considered to be at high risk and should receive the yearly influenza vaccination.' "
Can people with severe egg allergies still get an annual influenza vaccination?,"'In December 2017, the American College of Allergy, ''Asthma'', and Immunology published an updated guideline and recommended that patients with egg allergy receive the influenza vaccine. Even though the vaccine is currently manufactured in eggs, there is only minimal egg protein in the vaccine. There is no increased risk of reaction in patients with egg allergy.''With this new recommendation to utilize the routine influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy, there is no need to utilize the egg-free vaccine that was released in 2013. Therefore, although the recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV) is not made using eggs, it is no longer needed.' "
"What is 
the hepatitis A vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Hepatitis A'' is an acute viral illness that is spread through contaminated water and food. It is less common in the United States but is still a common cause of ''hepatitis'' worldwide. The disease is very common in many other parts of the world, including Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, the Western Pacific, and Asia. It is primarily prevented by using good hygiene and through vaccination. ''Hepatitis A vaccine'' is routinely given to children; however, it is only recommended for certain high-risk adolescents and adults. Foreign travel is the most common reason for adults and adolescents to receive ''hepatitis'' A vaccination.' "
"What is the hepatitis B vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Hepatitis B'' is an acute viral illness that is primarily spread through the exposure to body fluids of an infected individual. It is highly ''contagious'' and can be transmitted through sexual intercourse as well as by sharing needles (drug abusers). Approximately 50% of infected individuals will be asymptomatic (have no symptoms of the disease). Most cases resolve without long-term complications. However, 1%-2% will develop chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B vaccine is given routinely to children. Adolescents who did not receive their three-shot series as a child should be given the vaccine. Adults are not routinely given the hepatitis B vaccine unless they belong to certain high-risk groups. One high-risk group is health care workers.' "
"What is the polio vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Polio'' is an acute viral illness that can cause severe ''paralysis'' and even death. Prior to the use of vaccine, tens of thousands of children developed paralytic polio (the worst form) in the U.S. every year. Since instituting an aggressive vaccine campaign, polio has been almost completely eradicated in the U.S. Most cases now in the U.S. are seen in people traveling from other countries or unvaccinated people from the U.S. traveling to other countries.''There are two forms of the polio vaccine: an oral form made from a live attenuated virus and an injection form made from an inactivated virus. The oral form of the vaccine (oral polio vaccine or OPV) is no longer used in the U.S. because it has been shown to cause polio in a small number of people. Only the shot form of the vaccine (intramuscular polio vaccine or IPV) is now used in the U.S. All children receive four doses of IPV. Adolescents who did not receive all four doses should be given an additional vaccine. Adults are not recommended to receive the polio vaccine unless they will be traveling to areas where polio still exists.' "
"What is the zoster 
vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Herpes zoster'' is a reactivation of an old infection with the varicella virus (chickenpox). This ''rash'' can occur shortly after the infection with chickenpox or many years later. It causes a severely painful skin ''rash'', and it can lead to ''chronic pain'' even after the rash is gone. In order to prevent the severe rash and the ''chronic pain'', a vaccine (''Zostavax'') was developed and is recommended for all adults over 60 years of age.' "
"What is the typhoid vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Typhoid fever'' is an acute febrile illness caused by the bacterium ''Salmonella typhi''. It is spread by contaminated food and water. Although quite common at one time in the U.S., it is very rare today. Most cases are in people who have traveled outside the U.S. Worldwide, the disease affects 13 million people. People who are traveling to areas with high rates of ''typhoid fever'' should receive the vaccine prior to leaving the U.S. ''Travelers'' should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (''https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/'').' "
"What is the yellow fever vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Yellow fever'' is an acute illness caused by a virus. The disease is extremely rare in the U.S., and it is usually found in people who have traveled outside the country. The disease is mild in many people, but it can cause ''liver'' failure and death. Approximately 20% of those who get the disease will die. ''Travelers'' to going to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America are required by international health regulations to have a ''yellow fever'' vaccination. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
"What is the rabies vaccine, and who should 
receive it?","'Rabies'' is an acute viral infection that is considered universally fatal even with excellent treatment (there has been one reported survival with extremely aggressive treatment). Rabies is extremely rare in the U.S. because all states require ''dogs'' and cats to be vaccinated. Most cases in the U.S. are from bites from wild animals (raccoons, bats, foxes, and skunks). However, rabies is common in dogs and cats as well as wild animals in other parts of the world. Travelers who are visiting areas where rabies is prevalent should receive the vaccine. The vaccine can also be given after an animal bite, but it must be given quickly. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
"What is the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and who should receive it?","'Japanese ''encephalitis'' is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is a leading cause of ''encephalitis'' in Asia. It is uncommon in the U.S. and, therefore, is not recommended as a routine vaccination. People traveling to certain countries in Asia are recommended to receive the vaccine. Travelers should consult the CDC web site for specific recommendations depending on the countries they plan to visit (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/).' "
Are any side effects associated with immunizations administered to teens and adults?,"'Any vaccine can cause side effects, but for the most part, the side effects are minor. Common side effects are ''pain'', swelling, and redness at the injection site, low-grade ''fever'', shivering, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', muscle aches, and joint aches. The side effects for all of the different vaccines can be found on the CDC web site (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). Vaccines do not cause ''autism''; however, there are rare serious side effects that can be serious or even fatal. Many more people died of vaccine-preventable diseases prior to vaccines than ever suffer serious complications of vaccines.' "
"What is the BCG vaccine, and why don't we use it here in the United States?","'Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine used worldwide against ''tuberculosis'' (''TB''). The vaccine is not recommended in the United States because of our low rate of ''TB'', questions about the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent pulmonary (in the ''lungs'') TB, and concerns over interference with the test used to detect TB infection, the PPD. The vaccine is used extensively worldwide, with an estimated 100 million doses given. It is only used in areas where TB is common, and it is only given to children or immunocompromised adults (for example, a patient with ''HIV''). The vaccine has only marginal to no effect on preventing pulmonary TB; however, it does decrease the chances of getting tuberculous meningitis and miliary (all over the body) TB.' "

What is hepatitis?,"""The term '""'hepatitis'""' means inflammation of the ""'liver''. ''Hepatitis'' can be caused by ''viruses'', other infectious agents, ''alcohol'', and other chemicals. The two viruses that most commonly infect the liver are the ''hepatitis A'' virus and the ''hepatitis B'' virus. Although their names are similar, these viruses are not related. They differ in the way they are transmitted from person to person and their ability to cause chronic infection.' "
Hepatitis A vaccine,"'Hepatitis A'' is caused by a virus which is spread predominately through the fecal-oral route when small amounts of infected fecal matter are inadvertently ingested. Infected individuals shed large amounts of the virus in their ''stool'', starting about two weeks before symptoms present, and continue shedding the virus in their ''stool'' for one to three months.''Some patients with hepatitis A infection have no symptoms, and these asymptomatic infections are more common in children.''Most adults experience symptoms including:''Although the symptoms resolve over several weeks, ''fatigue'' can be prolonged. Rarely, ''viral hepatitis'' caused by hepatitis A can lead to liver failure, ''coma'' and death.''Hepatitis A does not cause chronic or persistent infection of the liver. Once a person has recovered from hepatitis A, he or she is immune to reinfection with hepatitis A for life. This is true because effective antibodies are developed against the hepatitis A virus. After infection with hepatitis A, these antibodies provide life-long protection against the virus. The ability of the body to make protective antibodies after infection with hepatitis A led researchers to develop ''vaccines'' against the disease.''Hepatitis A ''vaccine'"" is made of killed hepatitis A viruses and causes the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the hepatitis A virus. In most vaccine recipients, antibodies start to develop immediately after the first dose but do not reach protective levels for 2 to 4 weeks. A second dose of the vaccine is recommended at least six months after the first dose to provide prolonged protection.""'Two hepatitis A ''vaccines'' are currently available in the United States (''Havrix'' and ''Vaqta''). The vaccine is given as an injection into the deltoid muscle of the arm. Both Havrix and Vaqta provide high level protection against hepatitis A. There is also a combination vaccine called hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection (''Twinrix'') that protects against both hepatitis A and ''hepatitis B''. The dosing schedule for Twinrix is different from the other hepatitis A ''vaccines'' and requires three doses over six months.''In the United States, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all children at one year of age. Vaccination also is recommended for individuals in high-risk settings. Examples include:''Side effects of the hepatitis A vaccine usually are mild. Soreness at the site of injection is common. Less commonly, recipients may complain of ''headache'' or ''fatigue''. Serious ''allergic'' reactions are possible, but are rare.'""A second option for protecting people against hepatitis A is to administer antibodies that are already programmed to attack the virus. When people donate blood, the part of the blood carrying antibodies (the 'immune globulin' fraction) can be separated. Because some blood donors are likely to have antibodies against the hepatitis A virus, pooled immune globulin from many donors is likely to contain antibodies against hepatitis A. This immune globulin can be injected into a person at risk for hepatitis A and will provide immediate but temporary protection against infection. Protection with immune globulin lasts two to four months depending on the dose. Immune globulin is used when immediate protection against hepatitis A is required. An example would be someone who is leaving immediately to travel to rural areas of a developing country. Such a ""'traveler'' would also receive hepatitis A vaccine but would not have time to develop antibodies before departure. Immune globulin sometimes is in short supply and should be used only when necessary.''These measures will reduce the risk that the exposed person will contract hepatitis A by 85% to 90% if given within two weeks of exposure.' Close contact with an infected person increases the chances of contracting the virus. Children are particularly contagious because they have lower standards of hygiene and may not appear sick. The hepatitis A virus also may be spread by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated by infected individuals. Much less commonly, contaminated needles or blood may spread hepatitis A. nausea, poor appetite, abdominal pain, fatigue, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), and dark urine. travelers to developing countries, men who have sex with men, users of illicit drugs, persons needing frequent blood products, and people who have chronic liver disease. If an unvaccinated person is exposed to hepatitis A, he or she should be given the vaccine or immune globulin as soon as possible. Vaccine is used for exposed persons aged one to 40 years. Immune globulin currently is recommended for exposed persons over the age of 40 years."
Hepatitis B vaccine,"'Hepatitis B'' was previously referred to as ""serum hepatitis"" because it usually is spread by the transfer of infected blood or serum (for example, through needle sticks, blood transfusions, ''hemodialysis'', and ''childbirth''). Hepatitis B also is spread through sexual intercourse and may be passed from mother to child. Inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids may occur during tattooing, body piercing, or when sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person. Persons infected with hepatitis B may be asymptomatic or may develop fatigue, ''jaundice'', and ''weight loss''. Rarely - though more commonly than with hepatitis A - acute infection with hepatitis B can cause liver failure and death.''Most infected adults are able to clear the hepatitis B virus from their body and become immune to further infections with hepatitis B. However, some people are not able to clear the hepatitis B virus and it progresses to chronic (persistent) infection and inflammation of the liver. Most infants infected at birth and 25% to 50% of infected children aged 1–5 years have chronic persistent infection.''Chronic infection may be mild or may damage the liver. The majority of individuals with chronic hepatitis B who clear the virus and are ""cured"" still have detectable virus in the liver. However, the importance of this fact is unclear since there is no evidence of consequences to the presence of the virus except that it can be reactivated with immunosuppression. Individuals with hepatitis B virus only in the liver are not infectious. Some people with chronic hepatitis B infection have their lives shortened by complications of ''liver disease'', ''cirrhosis'', or ''liver cancer''.''Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B by more than 75% in the United States. The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B vaccines available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection (''Engerix-B''\xa0and\xa0Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection.''There are also combination vaccines on the market that provide protection against hepatitis B and other diseases. For example:''Hepatitis B vaccines are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals develop protective antibodies when they get the vaccine and are protected from infection with hepatitis B. Among individuals at high risk for infection with hepatitis B include:''Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include:''A blood test for hepatitis B antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that antibodies have been produced. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve the response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine usually are mild, primarily soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious allergic reactions (''anaphylaxis'') is less than one per million doses.''In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not receive it at birth. Adults in high risk situations also are advised to receive hepatitis B vaccine.''Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. ''Travelers'' who visit these countries for a prolonged period of time (usually 6 months or longer) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination.''Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or to a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and may also recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in persons exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse.''Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if an exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to have responded to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine and form antibodies.''Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their ''newborn'' infants. All ''pregnant'' women should have blood drawn to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth. This is 85% to 95% effective in eliminating the risk of hepatitis B infection in the infant.' hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection (Twinrix), which provides protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B; Haemophilus B/hepatitis B vaccine - injection (Comvax) provides protection against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a cause of meningitis); and Pediarix provides protection against hepatitis B, tetanus, pertussis and polio. health care workers, dentists, intimate and household contacts of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, public safety workers who may be exposed to blood products, men who have sex with men, individuals with multiple sexual partners, dialysis patients, injection drug users, persons with chronic liver disease, residents and staff in institutions that care for persons with developmental disabilities, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and persons who require repeated transfusions or blood products. dialysis units, drug treatment facilities, sexually transmitted diseases clinics and correctional facilities."
Why should travelers see a physician before they leave on a trip?,"'Travelers'' should see a physician before leaving for a trip if''The goal of a pre-travel medical evaluation is to help travelers protect themselves against (1) common diseases that may be mild but that will disrupt their trip and (2) less common diseases that may be serious or even fatal. All travelers need to be up to date on routine ''vaccines'' they would normally get if they were not traveling.  For example, an annual ''influenza'' vaccination (''flu shot'') is recommended if traveling during influenza season. Travelers should also be up to date on ''tetanus'' ''vaccines''. If a ''tetanus'' booster is needed, a physician may elect to use the Tdap ''vaccine'' that also provides continuing protect against adult ''pertussis''. No immunizations are required for re-entry into the United States after travel. Some countries require you to provide an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis prior to allowing border entry from certain countries, even if you are only stopping there to change planes, whether you are traveling to your destination or coming home. '  they are going to developing countries, they are visiting sites that are not on the usual tourist routes or traveling to high altitudes, they have chronic diseases that could be affected by travel, they are visiting countries that require vaccinations before they allow travelers to enter the country."
"What diseases occur in travelers, and how can disease be prevented?","'Travelers can pick up infectious diseases from contaminated food or water, from ''insect bites'"", animal bites, or from other people. Immunizations, medications, and simple precautions can reduce or eliminate the risk of many of these travel-related infections. While infectious disease is the most common concern for travelers, it is important to remember that the most common cause of death in travelers is motor-vehicle accidents. Be sure to look both ways before crossing the street, review traffic laws (especially in countries where people drive on the opposite side of the road), don't get in a car with a driver who is drunk, and use seat belts and infant/child car seats if available both at home and when traveling.""'This review will cover infectious diseases commonly encountered by travelers or those for which vaccinations are recommended.

Traveler's diarrhea,"""Traveler's diarrhea""' is the most common medical complaint in travelers, occurring in up to 50% of travelers to developing countries.  It occurs when infectious organisms are inadvertently ingested by travelers, resulting in one to five days of ''loose stools''. The stools are often watery and may be accompanied by abdominal ''cramps'"". Although not fatal, traveler's ""'diarrhea'' can cause ''dehydration'', ''vomiting'', low-grade ''fever'"", and discomfort to the point that some travelers have to change their itineraries. It is important to note that traveler's ""'diarrhea'' is not associated with bloody stools, severe ''abdominal pain'', or high ''fever''. These symptoms are suggestive of more serious conditions and should prompt medical attention.'""Traveler's ""'diarrhea'' is spread when bacteria or other infectious agents such as ''viruses'"" are ingested. Traveler's diarrhea is most often spread through contaminated food or water, or by putting contaminated hands in the mouth. Even small amounts of contamination can cause infection. Although bacteria are the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, there have been outbreaks of diarrhea on cruise ships caused by viruses known as noroviruses. Noroviruses spread readily from person to person.""'Travelers can get diarrhea in most areas of the world, but some countries pose a higher risk. High-risk areas include most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. Risk is increased if the traveler is adventurous with his or her ''diet'', eats foods from street vendors, or travels to areas off the usual tourist routes.'' Protective measures may help prevent or shorten the duration of traveler\'s diarrhea. All travelers should wash their hands often and understand basic food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""). However, it has been shown that even well-informed travelers often choose to eat foods that pose an increased risk of traveler\'s diarrhea. Therefore, travelers at risk should carry in their first-aid kit an antimotility agent such as ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''; ''Kaopectate II''; Imodium A-D; ''Maalox Anti-Diarrheal'' Caplets; Pepto Diarrhea Cont) and start taking it if they get symptoms. Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') is also helpful.'' Because bacteria are developing resistance to many antibiotics, many older antibiotics do not work, and those prescribed currently may not be effective in the future. Antibiotics also have risks of their own and do not protect against viruses or parasites; therefore, routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for most travelers. However, many physicians recommend that travelers carry along an antibiotic to take in case they get diarrhea. Fluoroquinolones, such as ''ciprofloxacin'', ''levofloxacin'', ''ofloxacin'', or ''norfloxacin'', are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic; ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan'') are alternatives. If an antimotility agent (a drug that reduces gastrointestinal motility) and an antibiotic are started at the first sign of diarrhea, symptoms may be shortened to only a few hours instead of a few days.'' Physicians might prescribe daily antibiotics or daily bismuth subsalicylate to prevent diarrhea in people who are immunosuppressed, or when the purpose of a trip would be severely impacted if it were interrupted by diarrhea. This is not needed for most travelers, and bismuth subsalicylate may cause adverse effects in doses required for protection. ''Pregnant'' women and children need special advice because many of these ''drugs'' are not appropriate for them. Affected people should stay well hydrated with ''beverages'' that are sealed, treated with chlorine, boiled, or are otherwise known to be purified; in most cases, commercial sports ''drinks'"" are adequate, but very sugary drinks can worsen diarrhea. If antibiotics are prescribed, fill the prescription before travel; if you must buy drugs during a trip to an area of the world with few drug regulations, avoid counterfeits by using a licensed pharmacy, asking the pharmacist about the ingredients, and checking the packaging for poor print quality or odd appearance; drugs should be in the manufacturer's original packaging if at all possible. "" "
Malaria,"'''Malaria'' is an infection caused by a protozoan that enters ''red blood cells'' and multiplies until the cells burst open. The broken cells release the young protozoa into the bloodstream where they infect more red blood cells. This release of young protozoa causes high ''fevers'' that can last for several hours, as well as ''anemia'' due to the destruction of ''red cells''. The fever of ''malaria'' often comes and goes, coinciding with when the infected red cells burst open. With some types of malaria, the protozoa can hide in the ''liver'' and cause episodes of fever over many years. In serious cases, malaria can cause the kidneys to shut down, can infect the brain (cerebral malaria), or cause death.'' Malaria is spread to people by mosquitoes. The mosquitoes bite between dusk and dawn. Malaria occurs in many tropical areas and a few areas that have a milder climate. Travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia may be at risk for the disease. Some countries in Central America and the Caribbean also have malaria. Not every area of a country will be affected. The people who have lived all their lives in the area with malaria typically have some immunity, but travelers are at much higher risk for severe infection, especially with some types of malaria. Malaria is serious enough to see a doctor about possible preventive medication if your itinerary suggests you might be exposed. The CDC has a web page that tells where malaria occurs (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/). Many public-health departments and some private travel clinics provide pre-travel evaluations. CDC also offers a ""Find a Clinic"" web page to help you find one (''http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/find-clinic''). The American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene also has a list of clinics that specialize in travel medicine (''http://www.astmh.org/source/ClinicalDirectory/'').You should visit these clinics at least four to six weeks before you travel in case you need ''vaccines'', but especially with malaria it is better to go later than not at all to avoid traveling unprotected.''Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites (see ""What can I do to avoid ''insect bites''?"") and by taking preventive medications. Travelers who will be exposed to malaria should take medications starting before travel to the area and continuing for a time after they leave the area. Several different medicines are available. Some are taken only once a week, and others are taken daily. In some countries, malaria has become resistant to older medicines. Your physician or travel clinic will choose which medicine to use based on what countries you are visiting. Some medicines must be started two weeks before departure, so you should plan to go to the doctor or travel clinic well in advance.  It is very important to take every last dose of preventive medication that may be prescribed to take after you return home, especially with types of malaria that hide in the liver and can return months later. ' "
Meningitis and encephalitis,"'There are several causes of meningitis, an infection of the lining and fluid around the brain and spinal cord. ''Encephalitis'' means that the brain tissue itself is also infected. There are serious types of meningitis and ''encephalitis'' that are associated with travel and can be prevented.''''Meningococcal meningitis'' is one of the most serious types associated with travel to certain areas. The cause is a bacterium called ''Neisseria meningitidis''. The disease can be quite severe or even fatal. The infection is spread from person to person by close contact through ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' or other respiratory means.'' Meningococcal meningitis occurs at low rates throughout the world, including the United States. However, some countries have high rates of disease and pose a special risk to travelers. This includes many countries in the ""meningitis belt"" of sub-Saharan Africa. Saudi Arabia has experienced outbreaks when pilgrims travel to religious sites.'' There are two effective vaccines to prevent meningitis. The choice of vaccine depends on the age of the patient. The vaccines are synthetic (meaning that they do not contain live infectious agents). They should not be given to people who have previously had a neurological illness called Guillain-Barré syndrome. Meningitis immunizations are now routinely recommended for adolescents and college freshmen in the United States. It is also recommended for travelers who are going to areas that have high rates of infection. Vaccination is required for pilgrims to religious sites in Saudi Arabia, and proof of vaccination (preferably an International Certificate of Vaccination) will be required at the border. The vaccination is effective for three to five years (depending on which of the two vaccines is given), after which revaccination may be recommended for travelers who travel to areas with high rates of infection.'' There are several kinds of viral encephalitis that occur in various areas of the world, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, which are spread by mosquito bites. They are fortunately rare, and most viral encephalitis is prevented by avoiding mosquito bites (see the section on insect precautions). Japanese encephalitis virus is preventable by vaccine, and a doctor or travel clinic can advise if you will need it.'' Meningitis and encephalitis caused by parasites (amoebae) is also a concern for travelers. Harmless amoebae are common in freshwater and plumbing all over the world. ''Naegleria fowleri'' prefers hot springs, lakes, rivers, or any warm freshwater that is untreated for human use; it may grow in pipes and hot water tanks of homes and buildings as chlorine dissipates. If affected water with enough''Naegleria'' is inhaled, it may cause severe  ''meningoencephalitis''; death occurs in 97%-99% of cases. This type of meningitis is hard to diagnose, children are often affected, and effective treatment is still being studied. Prevention is very easy. If bathing in hot springs or bodies of fresh water with unknown chlorination during hot seasons, keep the head above water, hold the nose shut, or use nose clips. Avoid getting bath or hose water up the nose. If you rinse your sinuses, or practice religious nasal cleansing, tap water is safe if boiled for at least one minute and left to cool. Other options include using chemical disinfectants, filters with an absolute pore size 1 micron or less, and distilled or sterile water. Drinking affected water cannot transmit''Naegleria'', and it cannot live in saltwater. ' "
Yellow fever,"'Yellow fever'' virus is a rare cause of illness in U.S. travelers, but it can be serious, and some countries require proof of vaccination before border entry. It is caused by a virus that attacks the liver. Symptoms start within three to five days of infection. In many people, the disease is mild and goes away. About 15% of people will develop severe disease with liver failure, and up to half will die. ''Yellow fever'' is spread by the bite of a mosquito.'' Yellow fever occurs in areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and South America. Not all countries in these areas have yellow fever. Even within a country, some areas may have yellow fever while others do not.'' There is a very effective vaccine available to prevent yellow fever. It contains a live virus that has been modified (""attenuated"") to make it safer. Vaccine side effects are usually mild. Rarely (a few cases per million doses), the vaccine virus can spread and cause severe disease. Infants under 6 months old, and people with weak immune systems (for example, people with certain chronic diseases, and some people with ''HIV'' infection or ''cancer'') should not receive the live vaccine. These people should consult with a doctor before traveling to an area where yellow fever occurs. For people 60 or over and pregnant or ''breastfeeding'' women, a doctor should carefully review the risks and benefits of the vaccine.'""Vaccination is generally recommended for travelers who will be exposed to yellow fever with the above exceptions. The vaccine may be required for entry into some countries. Check the CDC web site to see if vaccination is required for your trip. If you get vaccinated, you should receive an International Certificate of Vaccination, signed and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine was given. If you cannot be vaccinated, a medical waiver can be given. Take the certificate and any waivers with you on your trip. You may need it to enter your destination country or get back home. This certificate is valid for 10 years, and some countries are starting to accept it as valid for life. Yellow fever vaccine is only given at authorized U.S. yellow fever vaccine clinics, so you will need to check well in advance. CDC can help you find a place to get yellow fever vaccine (""'http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellow-fever-vaccination-clinics-search.aspx'').''The first line of defense against illness transmitted by insects is prevention of bites (see ""What can I do to avoid insect bites?"").' "
Hepatitis A,"'Hepatitis A'' is caused by a virus that infects the liver. People get sick two to six weeks after they get the virus. Symptoms include ''nausea'', yellowing of the skin and eyes (''jaundice''), ''dark urine'', pale stools, ''loss of appetite'', and ''fatigue''. The symptoms take two to six months to completely resolve. Unlike some other ''hepatitis'' viruses, ''hepatitis A'' does not cause chronic ''liver disease''. In other words, once the person gets better, he or she is completely cured. Some infected people (especially children) are asymptomatic, meaning that they do not develop symptoms. ''Hepatitis'' A is spread when human waste is mistakenly ingested. Even a small amount can cause disease, such as might occur by ''shaking hands'' with someone with contaminated hands and then touching the mouth. Food preparers have transmitted disease by mistakenly contaminating food. It is also possible to get hepatitis A through sexual contact or contaminated needles or blood. Hepatitis A occurs throughout the world but is more common in developing countries. ''There is an effective vaccine that is quite good at preventing hepatitis A. If you are traveling to a developing country, your doctor will probably recommend vaccination. In a few cases, if you will be traveling before the vaccine has time to take effect, your doctor might recommend a more temporary measure called gamma globulin instead of or in addition to the vaccine. Remember to follow food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""). The vaccine also requires a second dose six to 12 months later for full protection (or two or three more doses if combined with ''hepatitis B vaccine''), so you will to follow up with your doctor after coming home. However, ''hepatitis A vaccine'' is protective for at least 25 years.' "
Typhoid fever,"'Typhoid fever'' is an infection caused by a bacterium called ''Salmonella typhi''. Most people who get sick develop a ''headache'', a very high fever (up to 103 F or 104 F), and ''fatigue''.   ''Nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, or ''constipation'' may also occur.''The disease spreads when infected human waste contaminates food or water or is otherwise ingested. Some people are able to carry the bacteria inside their body for a very long time (""carriers""), even after symptoms have disappeared. Carriers can get it again or spread it to other people. People who get sick may be given antibiotics by their doctor. In addition to the antibiotics, people should make sure they always wash their hands after toileting and before cooking, so that they don\'t spread the disease to anyone else. Some occupations require proof that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria before you may go back to work; a doctor may perform several cultures of your ''stool'' before clearing you for work.''Typhoid fever occurs in many areas around the world, especially Asia, Africa, and South America. A vaccine is available to reduce the risk of getting typhoid, and it lasts several years. Ask a doctor or local public-health department about typhoid vaccination before you travel. Food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?"") also reduce the risk of disease. The saying ""''Boil'' it, cook it, peel it, or forget it!"" helps you remember how to prevent becoming sick with typhoid fever (and many other infections) while traveling. ' "
Polio,"'''Polio'' is a viral illness that can lead to severe neuromuscular problems. Polio is spread from person to person. Infected oral secretions and feces can cause disease. Many people have no symptoms, but some have neurological problems such as ''weakness'' and ''paralysis''. Symptoms are especially severe if they involve the ''breathing'' muscles. Some people are left with permanent neurological disabilities such as paralysis of limbs or breathing muscles.''Thanks to a global public-health campaign, many countries no longer have polio. A few countries in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East still have outbreaks. The list of infected countries is constantly changing, as some countries successfully eliminate the infection and others become reinfected. If there is international spread from a country within 12 months, the World Health Organization (WHO) may declare a public-health emergency and issue updated vaccine requirements for travelers staying in those countries longer than four weeks. Proof of vaccination on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis may be required before leaving. Check the CDC web site (http://cdc.gov/travel) for an update to see if your itinerary includes any of these countries.''The inactivated polio vaccine is recommended if the traveler is going to an area where polio is still occurring. Unless special circumstances arise as above, a single lifetime booster dose in adulthood is sufficient if the traveler has received the usual vaccine series in childhood. If the traveler has not been fully vaccinated in the past (has not received all doses at recommended times), more doses may be needed.' "
Cholera,"'''Cholera'' is an infection caused by bacteria (''Vibrio'' cholerae'') that look like curved rods when viewed under the microscope. The bacteria attach to the lining of the ''intestines'' and secrete a toxin. The cholera toxin can causes the cells in the intestines to pour out life-threatening amounts of fluid. The excess water loss can lead to watery diarrhea, so severe that it is difficult to keep the body hydrated.  The term ""rice water"" is often used to describe this diarrhea because of the appearance of small white flecks of ''mucus'' in liquid.''Cholera spreads when human waste contaminates water and food. Because it takes high numbers of bacteria to cause infection, the contamination usually has to be quite significant. For example, in areas of poor sanitation, cholera can be spread when the drinking water supply is contaminated by feces from people who are sick.'' Cholera is most common in areas that have poor sanitation, with faulty sewage systems or contaminated drinking water. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been affected for several decades. Cholera can be prevented by using proper sanitation and sewage treatment. Boiling, filtering, or chlorinating water can help to prevent the spread of cholera. Treatment is mainly oral rehydration with simple ''electrolyte'' solutions. There is no vaccine for cholera that is approved in the United States. Following food and water precautions is the first line of defense (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?"").''Cholera is very rare in recreational travelers, but travelers providing humanitarian aid to underdeveloped areas, or areas were sanitation and water supply is disrupted by disaster, should be aware of the risk of cholera. Basic knowledge of hand hygiene, infection control measures, and correct sanitation procedures can avoid inadvertent spread of infections and keep aid workers healthy and able to help. ' "
What about diseases for which there is no vaccine or preventive medication?,"'There are several diseases of concern for travelers for which there is no vaccine or medicine to prevent infection. Among these are some viral infections, ''sexually transmitted diseases'', and parasitic infections. ''Many viral infections can be spread by biting insects such as ''ticks'' or mosquitoes. These include serious infections like hemorrhagic ''fevers'', viral infections that cause high fever, and bleeding. While epidemics have been rare, ''Ebola virus'' has spread in an unprecedented way in recent years, in certain areas of Africa and beyond. ''Ebola'' has been associated with eating wild-caught bats, monkeys, and other animals. Most travelers do not encounter these types of viral hemorrhagic fevers.''''Dengue fever'' occurs throughout the world in tropical areas. ''Symptoms of dengue'' fever are high fever, severe ''headache'' and ''joint pain'', and a drop in ''blood pressure''; occasionally, bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur in people who are reinfected. Chikungunya fever is native to Africa and Asia but has rapidly spread into the Caribbean in the same areas as dengue. Spread by the same mosquitoes, it causes high fever, severe joint ''pain'', and may be indistinguishable from dengue; fever resolves after a few days. Severe joint ''pain'' may last for several weeks, but it leaves no permanent joint damage. The key to preventing these infections is to follow insect precautions (see ""What can I do to avoid insect bites?"").'' Sexually transmitted diseases remain common and can be acquired anywhere in the world. ''HIV'' is a risk everywhere and remains incurable. ''Gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'', and ''syphilis'' remain common. The only sure way to prevent disease is to abstain from sexual intercourse. Correct use of ''condoms'' will reduce risk as well as unintended ''pregnancy''. ''HPV'' vaccines now available will reduce the risk of acquiring infection with the ''human papillomavirus'' virus that causes ''genital warts'' and ''cervical cancer''.'' Parasites occur in most areas of the world but are especially common in tropical and subtropical regions. Some are spread by eating contaminated food (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""), while others are spread by direct contact with infected water or soil. Most travelers do not get parasitic infections, but those who are going into rural areas of developing countries should ask their doctors about parasites they might encounter. '' Infectious-disease outbreaks occur periodically, and officials may recommend additional precautions. Examples have included outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalitis (''mad cow disease'') or ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (''SARS''). Travelers should check the CDC web site to obtain health and risk information specific to their destination country. CDC also has specific advice for special groups and situations (''http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/common-travel-health-topics'').' "
What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?,"  The first line of defense against illness at home and abroad is good hand hygiene. Wash hands with soap and uncontaminated water. If water quality is unknown, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol often and before eating or drinking. In general, it is best not to drink tap water in a developing country. Boiled water and drinks made from boiled water (tea) are usually safe. Carbonated bottled water or sodas are usually safe. Uncarbonated bottled water may be safe, but even bottled water may be filled up from the local tap water source. Iodine tablets or commercially available water filters may be used to purify water when camping. Ice (including flavored shaved ice or popsicles) is not safe in areas where the water supply may be contaminated. Make ice from disinfected or bottled, sealed water. Alcohol (beer, wine) is usually safe. Fruits and vegetables washed in contaminated water may have a residue of bacteria. In general, wash in clean water and peel them yourself. Hot, well-cooked foods are usually safe. Avoid runny eggs. Avoid street vendor food. Avoid salsas and salads made with raw ingredients. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Spices do not kill bacteria. Food can be so spicy that it burns your mouth and still cause traveler's diarrhea or more serious diseases. Foods that put the traveler at high risk for infection include undercooked meat or seafood and bush meat (wild game such as bats, monkeys, other jungle game)."
What can I do to avoid insect bites?," Wear light, protective clothing. Use insect repellents that contain DEET (most popular brand-name insect repellents in the United States contain DEET), or picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products. Reapply according to directions. When using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and then repellent. If you are hiking, tuck your pant legs into your sock. Check yourself over for ticks at the end of the hike including all creases, navel, and scalp. Many species bite in the nymph stage and are very small. Removing them within 24 hours prevents most infections. Use mosquito nets or window screens if they are available. Products that contain permethrin (NIX, an insect repellent) are available to spray on your clothes or tent for added protection.
"
What should be in my travel first-aid kit or medicine kit?,"  Your kit should be packed in your carry-on luggage. Prescription medications that you take at home Medications that your doctor recommended to prevent travel-related illness, 
including malaria medications, if indicated Over-the-counter medicines to treat minor illnesses (heartburn, headache, head cold, mild diarrhea, motion sickness, travel sickness) Sunscreen, lotion to use to treat sunburn Insect repellents Alcohol based sanitizer with over 60% ethanol content Bandages, tape, thermometer, and tweezers Other items according to your itinerary. Adventure travelers who are far from medical help will need to consider additional items such as water purification tablets, commercial suture/syringe kits to be used by local health-care provider (ask your doctor for a letter on letterhead stationary prescribing its use), and other necessities. Condoms, especially if there is a chance you may have sex with new partners Women who get vaginal yeast infections should consider carrying along a treatment course (pills or vaginal products)
"
What are the medical concerns with jet lag?,"'Jet lag'' happens when travelers cross several time zones and disrupt their normal ''sleep''-wake cycle. ''To reduce the duration and the symptoms of jet lag, try to be outside when the sun is up. It may make for a very long (or short) first day, but it will help you adjust more quickly. Some travelers also try to change their ''sleep''-wake habits before they leave. ''Medicines are available that can promote sleep, but there are few studies on how well they work with jet lag. ''Zolpidem'' (''Ambien'') is a prescription sedative that promotes sleep. Another group of prescription drugs known as ''benzodiazepines'' also promotes sleep, but they may have more side effects, including temporary ''amnesia''. ''Melatonin'' is a natural hormone available as an herbal preparation in the United States. Doses of approximately 5 mg have been shown to induce sleep. Melatonin is available over the counter. ' "
What if I have a medical condition or a chronic disease?,"'Careful preparation will allow most travelers with medical conditions to have a safe and enjoyable trip. See your physician before traveling to be sure your understand how to manage your condition while traveling. In some cases, an ''exercise'' regimen may be recommended to get in shape before the trip. It is important to check with your health-insurance provider to determine what is covered in the destination country. ''Travelers with ''diabetes'' may need to adjust their ''insulin''-dosing schedule if they cross several time zones.  Frequent monitoring of blood ''sugar'' (glucose) by ''finger stick'' is usually recommended. Remember to carry insulin in your carry-on baggage (otherwise it will freeze in the cargo hold). An identification bracelet showing that you have ''diabetes'' is also recommended. Carry a source of ''sugar'' in case your blood glucose drops. Remember that ''exercise'' may cause blood sugar to dip, so always carry your supplies on hikes, etc. Finally, keep up with your fluids. Hydration can help avoid complications if your blood sugar jumps. ''Travelers with ''heart disease'' should carry a recent ''electrocardiogram'' and a list of all current medications. Medications should be kept in carry-on luggage. If you have a ''pacemaker'', you should know the name of the company that made it and how to contact someone if it stops working. Travelers with unstable ''heart disease'' (unstable ''angina'', severe ''heart failure'', recent ''heart attack'', or unstable ''heart'' rhythm) should delay travel until their condition is stable. ''Travelers who have problems with their immune system due to active ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', or ''AIDS'' may encounter special problems. In general, vaccines made from live organisms are usually avoided in people with significantly impaired immune systems. Even non-live travel-appropriate vaccines may not work as well as usual, but they are still beneficial and should be given. Consider delaying travel until the immune system is back to normal, if this is possible. Consultation with a disease specialist and a travel-medicine specialist before departure is strongly recommended. ''''Blood clots'' may pose a risk to certain travelers, especially on long flights or periods of immobility. Discuss your risk with your doctor, and consider wearing compression or support stockings on your trip.''Travelers with disabilities should know that accommodations will vary widely between and within countries. The Department of Transportation can assist with getting accommodations on airplanes (1-800-778-4838). Service animals such as guide ''dogs'' are subject to quarantine regulations and may not be allowed to enter some countries. ''A broad array of special situations and common ''travel health'' topics are addressed by CDC (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/common-travel-health-topics).' "
What if I'm traveling while pregnant?,"'Pregnant women should consult with their obstetrician before travel. If available, a consultation with a travel medicine clinic is also recommended. Live vaccines are usually avoided in pregnancy. An up to date ''flu'' shot is safe and important, because flu can be very serious in pregnancy, and flu circulates at different times throughout the world. Some medications must also be avoided. This may put pregnant women at higher risk for getting sick in a foreign country. Blood clots are also more likely during pregnancy, especially with prolonged immobility and air travel.''Pregnant women should also be aware that the quality of obstetrical care in foreign countries varies considerably. It is best to have the name of a reputable clinic or hospital on hand. Women in the ''third trimester'' should consider delaying travel until after delivery. Check with your health-insurance provider in advance to determine what is covered in the destination country. You may want to purchase medical travel insurance with evacuation services (See ""Travel Health Insurance & Medical Evacuation Insurance"").''Diarrhea, some types of hepatitis, and malaria can be especially severe in pregnant women. Follow food, water, and insect precautions. Avoid areas with malaria if at all possible, and take medications as directed. ' "
What about traveling with children?,"'Children should be up to date on all routine vaccinations including those for ''mumps'', ''measles'', ''rubella'', polio, ''hepatitis B'', tetanus, ''diphtheria'', and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox''/''shingles'').  Some vaccinations and medications are not recommended for children. This means that the risk or severity of certain diseases is increased in children.''Diarrhea is more common in children because so much ends up in their mouths. Children can quickly become dehydrated. Make sure that your child drinks plenty of fluids. Consider adding an oral rehydration solution to your medical kit.''Children are attracted to animals and are more likely to get bitten. Bite wounds may become infected or transmit ''rabies''. Keep children away from animals.''Newborns and infants are at special risk because they are easily dehydrated and many vaccines and medications are contraindicated in this age group. Breastfeeding will help reduce the risk of diarrhea. There are limited options for malaria prevention in infants. Around the world, malaria remains one of the major ''causes of death'' in children. ' "
Travel health insurance & medical evacuation insurance,"'Most health insurance policies have very limited coverage outside the home country, and your portion of the cost may be much more than it would be at home. Some may not cover travel-related care at all, or not cover emergencies related to high-risk activities. You may also be more comfortable with familiar health care in familiar surroundings, and being seriously ill away from home and family may can add an unanticipated and heavy financial burden, as well as psychological ''stress''. Furthermore, most care will require up front cash or credit payment or not accept health insurance.'' If you have a chronic disease, immune deficiency, or are pregnant in the third trimester, it may be especially beneficial, but anyone traveling outside the continental U.S. may wish to consider purchasing short-term travel health or medical evacuation insurance. This type of coverage is usually inexpensive compared to the cost of an unexpected health emergency. Most out of country health emergencies are related to motor-vehicle accidents and ''trauma'', rather than health issues.''The U.S. Department of State can provide information on health care and medical emergencies when traveling abroad (http://www. travel.state.gov).'

What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
How Do Vacuum Constriction Devices Work?,"'To use a vacuum constriction device:''Intercourse can be attempted with the constriction band in place to helpmaintain the erection. The band can be left on safely for up to 30 minutes toallow for successful intercourse.''Be sure that devices brought without a prescription contains a ""quick release"" feature, as there have been reports of penile injuries due to devices that did not release its vacuum on-demand or released it too slowly.' Place the pump, which can be pumped by hand or run on batteries, over the penis. Pump the air out of the cylinder so that a vacuum is created. The vacuum draws blood into the shaft of the penis and causes it to swell and become erect. Once the penis is erect, with the help of lubricant, slide the retaining band down onto the lower end of the penis. Remove the pump after releasing the vacuum."
How Well Do Vacuum Constriction Devices Work?,"'Studies suggest that about 50%-80% of men are satisfied with the results ofVCDs. As with any other method of treatment for ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED''),satisfaction rates may decrease with time.' "
"Who Should Consider Using a Vacuum Constriction 
Device?","'Vacuum constriction devices are safe and can be used by patients with ''ED''caused by many conditions, including:''Vacuum constriction devices should not be used by men who may have asignificant congenital ''bleeding disorder'' or a disorder that predisposes them toa condition called ''priapism'' (a prolonged, sometime painful erection lastingover several hours). Examples include ''sickle cell anemia'', some forms of ''leukemia'', and other blood conditions.' Poor blood flow to the penis Diabetes Surgery for prostate or colon cancer Psychological issues such as anxiety or depression"
What Are the Side Effects of Vacuum Constriction Devices?,"'An erection obtained by the vacuum constriction device is not the same as anerection achieved naturally. The penis tends to be purplish in color and can be''cold'' or numb. Other side effects can include:' A black and blue mark or small area of 
bruising on the shaft of the penis.
This is usually painless and generally will resolve in a few days. Decrease in the force of the ejaculation. The constriction band traps the
ejaculate or semen at the time of orgasm. This is not dangerous and usually
does not cause pain. The semen will usually dribble out once the constriction
band is removed. Generally, this does not interfere with the pleasure of a
climax or orgasm."
How Much Does a Vacuum Constriction Device Cost?,"'Vacuum constriction devices vary in cost from $300 to $500, depending on thebrand and type. The battery-powered versions tend to be more expensive, butalso tend to work a little more quickly. Battery-powered devices are especiallyhelpful for men who do not have good hand strength or coordination or who have ''arthritis''.''There are several devices currently on the market that work effectively.Some of these devices can be obtained without a prescription.' "
Does Insurance Cover Vacuum Constriction Devices?,"'Most insurance policies, including Medicare, cover at least part of thecosts of a vacuum constriction device, especially if a medical cause for ''ED'' hasbeen documented. Medicaid, however, does not cover the device except under extreme circumstances in certain states.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is a C-section delivery?,"'A cesarean delivery, also called a C-section or cesarean birth, is the surgical ''delivery of a baby'"" through a surgical cut or incision in a woman's abdomen and uterus. After the baby is removed from the womb, the uterus and abdomen are closed with ""'stitches'' that later dissolve.''According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'', in 2015, 32% of births were by cesarean delivery—the lowest rate since 2007. Between 1996 and 2008, the number of cesarean deliveries increased by 72%.' "
What are the reasons for a C-section?,"'Cesarean delivery may be necessary in the following circumstances:' Labor is not progressing. Contractions may not open the cervix enough for the baby to move into the vagina for delivery. The infant's health is in danger. The umbilical cord, which connects the fetus to the uterus, may become pinched, or the fetus may have an abnormal heart rate. In these cases, a cesarean delivery allows the baby to be delivered quickly to address and resolve the baby's health problems. The baby is in the wrong position. Most often when this occurs, the baby is breech, or in a breech presentation, meaning that the baby is coming out feet first instead of head first. The baby may also be in a transverse (sideways) or oblique (diagonal) position. The pregnant woman is delivering two or more fetuses (multiple pregnancy). A cesarean delivery may be needed if labor has started too early (preterm labor), if the fetuses are not in good positions within the uterus for natural delivery, or if there are other problems. The baby is too large. Larger infants are at risk for complications during delivery. These include shoulder dystocia (pronounced dis-TO-she-ah), when the infant's head is delivered through the vagina but the shoulders are stuck.4 Women with gestational diabetes, especially if their blood sugar levels are not well controlled, are at increased risk for having large babies. The placenta has problems. Sometimes the placenta is not formed or working correctly, is in the wrong place in the uterus, or is implanted too deeply or firmly in the uterine wall. These issues can cause problems, such as preventing needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching the fetus or causing vaginal bleeding.5 The mother has an infection, such as HIV or herpes, that could be passed to the baby during vaginal birth. Cesarean delivery could help prevent transmission of the virus to the infant. The mother has a specific medical condition. A cesarean delivery enables the health care provider to better manage the mother's health issues."
What questions should you ask your doctor before a C-section?, Can I have a support person with me during the operation? What are my options for blocking pain? Can I have music played during the surgery? Will I be able to watch the surgery if I want?
What are your options to control pain during a C-section?,"'Women who have a cesarean delivery may be given ''pain'' medication with an epidural block, a spinal block, or general anesthesia.' An epidural block numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine. A spinal block also numbs the lower part of the body, but through an injection directly into the spinal fluid. Women who receive general anesthesia, often used for emergency cesarean deliveries, will not be awake during the surgery."
What should you expect during a C-section?,"'The doctor will make an incision that is about 6 inches long and goes through the skin, fat, and muscle. Most incisions are made side to side and low on the abdomen, called a bikini incision. Once inside the abdominal ''cavity'"", the doctor will make an incision to open the uterus. The opening is made just wide enough for the baby to fit through. One doctor will use a hand to support the baby while another doctor pushes the uterus to help push that baby out. Fluid will be suctioned out of your baby's mouth and nose. The doctor will hold up your baby for you to see.""'Once your baby is delivered, the umbilical cord is cut, and the placenta is removed. Then, the doctor cleans and stitches up the uterus and abdomen. The repair takes up most of the surgery time. Questions to ask:' Can my partner cut the umbilical cord? What happens to my baby right after delivery? Can I hold and touch my baby during the surgery repair? When is it okay for me to try to breastfeed? When can my partner take pictures or video?"
How long does a C-section procedure take?," Cesarean delivery takes about 45 to 60 minutes. It takes place in an operating room. So if you were in a labor and delivery room, you will be moved to an operating room. Often, the mood of the operating room is unhurried and relaxed. A doctor will give you medicine through an epidural or spinal block, which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body, but allows you to stay awake and alert. Spinal blocks work right away and completely numbs your body from the chest down. Epidural blocks take away pain, but you might be aware of some tugging or pushing. Medicine that makes you fall asleep and lose all awareness usually is only used in emergency situations. Your abdomen will be cleaned and prepped. You will have an IV for fluids and medicines. A nurse will insert a catheter to drain urine from your bladder. This is to protect the bladder from harm during surgery. Your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing also will be monitored."
How long does it take to recover from a C-section?,"'In the weeks ahead, you will need to focus on healing, getting as much rest as possible, and bonding with your baby — nothing else. Be careful about taking on too much and accept help as needed. Questions to ask:' You will be moved to a recovery room and monitored for a few hours. You might feel shaky, nauseated, and very sleepy. Later, you will be brought to a hospital room. When you and your baby are ready, you can hold, snuggle, and nurse your baby. Many people will be excited to see you. But don't accept too many visitors. Use your time in the hospital, usually two to four days, to rest and bond with your baby. C-section is major surgery, and recovery takes about six weeks (not counting the fatigue of new motherhood). Can my baby be brought to me in the recovery room? What are the best positions for me to breastfeed?"
What are the risks and complications of a C-section?,"'Cesarean delivery is a type of surgery, so it has risks and possible complications for both mother and baby.''Possible risks from a cesarean delivery include:''A woman who has a cesarean delivery may also have to stay in the hospital longer than a woman who has had a vaginal delivery.''The more cesarean deliveries a woman has, the greater her risk of certain medical problems and problems with future ''pregnancies'', such as uterine rupture and problems with the placenta.' Infection Blood loss Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder Reaction to medication or anesthesia used It is important to note that these risks also apply, to some degree, to vaginal birth."
Can you request a C-section?,"'Some women may want to have a cesarean birth even if vaginal delivery is an option. Women should discuss their options in detail with their doctor before making a decision about a type of delivery. The decision should consider the impact of the delivery not only on the current pregnancy, but also on future pregnancies. The safest method of delivery for both the mother and the fetus is an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.''Regardless of the type of delivery, unless there is a medical necessity, delivery should not occur before 39 weeks of pregnancy (called ""full term""). Watch this video to learn why it is important for the mother\'s and infant\'s health to wait until at least 39 weeks to deliver unless there is a medical reason to do so earlier.' "
Can you have a vaginal birth after a C-section (VBAC)?,"'Some women who have delivered previous babies by c-section would like to have their next baby vaginally. This is called vaginal delivery after c-section or VBAC. Women give many reasons for wanting a VBAC. Some want to avoid the risks and long recovery of surgery. Others want to experience vaginal delivery.''Today, VBAC is a reasonable and safe choice for most women with prior cesarean delivery, including some women who have had more than one cesarean delivery. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that multiple c-sections can cause serious harm. If you are interested in trying VBAC, ask your doctor if you are a good candidate. A key factor in this decision is the type of incision made to your uterus with previous c-sections.''Your doctor can explain the risks of both repeat cesarean delivery and VBAC. With VBAC, the most serious danger is the chance that the c-section ''scar'' on the uterus will open up during labor and delivery. This is called uterine rupture. Although very rare, uterine rupture is very dangerous for the mother and baby. Less than 1 percent of VBACs lead to uterine rupture. But doctors cannot always predict if uterine rupture is likely to occur in a woman. This risk, albeit very small, is unacceptable to some women.'""The percent of VBACs is dropping in the United States for many reasons. Some doctors, hospitals, and patients have concerns about the safety of VBAC. Some hospitals and doctors are unwilling to do VBACs because of fear of lawsuits and insurance or staffing expenses. Many doctors, however, question if this trend is in the best interest of women's health.""'Choosing to try a VBAC is complex. If you are interested in a VBAC, talk to your doctor and read up on the subject. Only you and your doctor can decide what is best for you. VBACs and planned c-sections both have their benefits and risks. Learn the pros and cons and be aware of possible problems before you make your choice. If your doctor or hospital does not support VBAC, it may be necessary to find providers who will accommodate your wishes.' "
What is normal vaginal bleeding?,"""Normal vaginal bleeding is the periodic blood that flows as a discharge from the woman's uterus. Normal (menstrual) vaginal bleeding is also called menorrhea. The process by which menorrhea occurs is called ""'menstruation''.''Normal vaginal bleeding occurs because of cyclic hormonal changes. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. The hormones also regulate the ''menstrual cycle''. The ovary, or female gonad, is one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a Fallopian tube to the uterus.''Unless ''pregnancy'' occurs, the cycle ends with the shedding of part of the inner lining of the uterus, which results in menstruation. Although it is actually the end of the physical cycle, the first day of menstrual bleeding is designated as ""day 1"" of the menstrual cycle in medical jargon.''The time of the cycle during which menstruation occurs is referred to as menses. The menses occurs at approximately four-week intervals, representing the menstrual cycle.'""Menarche is the time in a girl's life when menstruation first begins. ""'Menopause'"" is the time in a woman's life when the function of the ovaries ceases and menstrual periods stop. ""'Menopause'' is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months. The average age of ''menopause'' is 51 years old.' "
What is abnormal vaginal bleeding?,"'Abnormal vaginal bleeding is a flow of blood from the vagina that occurs either at the wrong time during the month or in inappropriate amounts. In order to determine whether bleeding is abnormal, and its cause, the doctor must consider three questions:''Every woman who thinks she has an irregular menstrual bleeding pattern should think carefully about the specific characteristics of her vaginal bleeding in order to help her doctor evaluate her particular situation. Her doctor will require the details of her menstrual history. Each category of menstrual disturbance has a particular list of causes, necessary testing, and treatment. Each type of abnormality is discussed individually below.'""Much of the abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy occurs so early in the pregnancy that the woman doesn't realize she is pregnant. Therefore, irregular bleeding that is new may be a sign of very early pregnancy, even before a woman is aware of her condition. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can also be associated with complications of pregnancy, such as ""'miscarriage'' or ''ectopic pregnancy''.''The duration, interval, and amount of vaginal bleeding may suggest what type of abnormality is responsible for the bleeding.''An abnormal duration of menstrual bleeding can be either bleeding for too long of a period (''hypermenorrhea''), or too short of a period (''hypomenorrhea'').'""The interval of the bleeding can be abnormal in several ways. A woman's menstrual periods can occur too frequently (""'polymenorrhea'') or too seldom (''oligomenorrhea''). Additionally, the duration can vary excessively from cycle to cycle (''metrorrhagia'').''The amount (volume) of bleeding can also be abnormal. A woman can either have too much bleeding (''menorrhagia'') or too little volume (''hypomenorrhea''). The combination of excessive bleeding combined with bleeding outside of the expected time of menstruation is referred to as ''menometrorrhagia''.''Usually, the ovary releases an egg every month in a process called ovulation. Normal ovulation is necessary for regular menstrual periods. There are certain clues that a woman is ovulating normally including regular menstrual intervals, vaginal ''mucus'' discharge halfway between menstrual cycles, and monthly symptoms including breast tenderness, fluid retention, ''menstrual cramps'', ''back pain'', and ''mood changes''. If necessary, doctors will order hormone blood tests (''progesterone'' level), daily home body temperature testing, or rarely, a sampling of the lining of the uterus (''endometrial biopsy'') to determine whether or not a woman is ovulating normally.''On the other hand, ''signs that a woman is not ovulating regularly'' include prolonged bleeding at irregular intervals after not having a ''menstrual period'' for several months, excessively low blood progesterone levels in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and lack of the normal body temperature fluctuation during the time of expected ovulation. Sometimes, a doctor determines that a woman is not ovulating by using endometrial sampling with biopsy.' Is the woman pregnant? What is the pattern of the bleeding? Is she ovulating?"
What causes vaginal bleeding during or after sexual intercourse?,"'Vaginal bleeding may occur during or after sexual intercourse for a number of reasons including:''Women who experience vaginal bleeding during or following sexual intercourse should always visit their doctor to determine the cause of the bleeding.'   Injuries to the vaginal wall or introitus (opening to the vagina) during intercourse Infections (for example, gonorrhea, Chlamydia, yeast infections) can be a cause of vaginal bleeding after intercourse. Lowered estrogen levels in peri-menopausal or postmenopausal women may cause the lining of the vagina to become thinned and easily inflamed or infected, and these changes can be associated with vaginal bleeding after intercourse. Anatomical lesions, such as tumors or polyps on the cervix or vaginal wall may lead to vaginal bleeding during or after intercourse."
What causes abnormal vaginal bleeding during pregnancy?,"'Many women have some amount of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Some studies show that up to 20% to 30% of pregnant women will experience some degree of vaginal bleeding while they are pregnant. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is more common with twins and other multiple gestations than with singleton ''pregnancies'' (pregnancy with one fetus).''Sometimes women experience a very scant amount of bleeding in the first two weeks of pregnancy, usually around the time of the expected menstrual period. This slight bleeding is sometimes referred to as ""implantation bleeding."" Doctors do not know for certain what causes this bleeding, but it may occur as a result of the fertilized egg implanting in the uterine wall.''The amount of the bleeding, the stage of pregnancy, and any associated symptoms can all help determine the cause of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy. While vaginal bleeding in pregnancy does not always signify a problem with the pregnancy, women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should be evaluated by a doctor.''Causes of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy include miscarriage, an abnormal location of the placenta, ''ectopic pregnancy'', cervical infection or polyp, and premature ''labor''. Chronic medical conditions and medication use can also be related to vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.' "
What causes abnormal vaginal bleeding in women who are ovulating regularly?,"'Abnormal vaginal bleeding in women who are ovulating regularly, most commonly involve excessive, frequent, irregular, or decreased bleeding. Some of the common conditions that produce each of these symptoms are discussed below.''Excessively heavy menstrual bleeding, called menorrhagia, is menstrual bleeding of greater than about eight tablespoons per month (normal menstrual bleeding produces between two and eight tablespoons per cycle). The most common pattern of menorrhagia is excessive bleeding that occurs in regular menstrual cycles and with normal ovulation.''There are several important reasons that menorrhagia should be evaluated by a doctor. First, menorrhagia can cause a woman substantial emotional distress and physical symptoms, such as severe cramping. Second, the blood loss can be so severe that it causes a dangerously lowered blood count (''anemia''), which can lead to medical complications and symptoms such as ''dizziness'' and ''fainting''. Third, there can be dangerous causes of menorrhagia that require more urgent treatment.''Benign (noncancerous) causes of menorrhagia include:''Though not common, menorrhagia can be a sign of ''endometrial cancer''. A potentially ''precancerous'' condition known as endometrial hyperplasia can also result in abnormal vaginal bleeding. This situation is more frequent in women who are over the age of 40.''Although there are many causes of menorrhagia, in most women, the specific cause of menorrhagia is not found even after a full medical evaluation. These women are said to have dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Although no specific cause of the abnormal vaginal bleeding is found in women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding, there are treatments available to reduce the severity of the condition.''Menstrual periods that are abnormally frequent (polymenorrhea) can be caused by certain ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') (such as ''Chlamydia'' or ''gonorrhea'') that cause inflammation in the uterus. This condition is called ''pelvic inflammatory disease''. ''Endometriosis'' is a condition of unknown cause that results in the presence of uterine lining tissue in other locations outside of the uterus. This can lead to ''pelvic pain'' and polymenorrhea. Sometimes, the cause of polymenorrhea is unclear, in which case the woman is said to have dysfunctional uterine bleeding.''Irregular menstrual periods (metrorrhagia) can be due to benign growths in the cervix, such as cervical polyps. The cause of these growths is usually not known. Metrorrhagia can also be caused by infections of the uterus (''endometritis'') and use of ''birth control pills'' (''oral contraceptives'""). Sometimes after an evaluation, a woman's doctor might determine that her metrorrhagia does not have an identifiable cause and that further evaluation is not necessary at that time.""'Perimenopause'' is the time period approaching or around menopause. It often is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, including menstrual periods at irregular intervals and variations in the amount of blood flow. Menstrual irregularities may precede the onset of true menopause (defined as the absence of periods for one year) by several years.''An overactive thyroid function (''hyperthyroidism'') or certain kidney diseases can both cause hypomenorrhea. Oral ''contraceptive'' pills can also cause hypomenorrhea. It is important for women to know that lighter, shorter, or even ''absent menstrual periods'' as a result of taking oral contraceptive pills does not indicate that the contraceptive effect of the oral contraceptive pills is inadequate. In fact, many women appreciate this ""side effect"" of oral contraceptives.''Women who are ovulating normally can experience light bleeding (sometimes referred to as ""''spotting''"") between menstrual periods. Hormonal ''birth control methods'' (oral contraceptive pills or patches) as well as IUD use for ''contraception'' may sometimes lead to light bleeding between periods. Psychological ''stress'', certain medications such as ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs'', and fluctuations in hormone levels may all be causes of light bleeding between periods. Other conditions that cause abnormal menstrual bleeding, or bleeding in women who are not ovulating regularly also can be the cause of intermenstrual bleeding.'   Uterine fibroids (benign tumors of smooth muscle; this type of tumor is known as a leiomyoma) Endometrial polyps (tiny benign growths that protrude into the womb) Adenomyosis (the presence of uterine lining tissue within the muscular wall of the uterus) Intrauterine devices (IUD's) Underactive thyroid function (hypothyroidism) The autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus Blood clotting disorders such as inherited bleeding disorders Certain medications, especially those that interfere with blood clotting"
What causes abnormal vaginal bleeding when your period is over?,"'Many conditions can interfere with the proper function of female hormones that are necessary for ovulation. For example, many conditions or circumstances may cause oligomenorrhea (reduction in the number of menstrual periods and/or amount of flow than usual) such as:'""The complete loss of ovulation is referred to as anovulation. Since ovulation allows the body to maintain an adequate supply of progesterone, anovulation is a condition in which a woman's hormonal balance is tipped toward too much estrogen and not enough progesterone. The excess estrogen stimulates the growth of the lining of the uterus. The result is that the lining of the uterus becomes too thick, which eventually leads to an increased risk of uterine pre-""'cancer'' or ''uterine cancer'' over many years. In order to replace progesterone and establish a proper hormonal balance, doctors will prescribe either progesterone to be taken at regular intervals, or an oral contraceptive that contains progesterone. Such treatment dramatically decreases the risk of uterine ''cancer'' in women who do not ovulate. Because uterine ''cancer'' results from many years of anovulation, any woman with prolonged anovulation needs to be treated to avoid developing uterine cancer.''Women who are postmenopausal (those who have not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months or more) should not experience vaginal bleeding. Any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal in postmenopausal women. Women who are taking combined estrogen and progesterone ''hormone therapy'' (''HRT'' or HT) may experience some light, irregular vaginal bleeding during the first six months of treatment. Likewise, postmenopausal women who are taking a cyclic hormone regimen (oral estrogen and a progestin for 10-12 days per month) may experience some vaginal bleeding that is similar to a menstrual period for a few days each month.''Postmenopausal women who experience heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding while on hormone therapy should always see a doctor to rule out more serious causes of vaginal bleeding. Less frequent but serious causes of vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women include endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (overgrowth of the lining tissues of the uterus, which can be precancerous in some cases).'   If a woman has chronic medical illnesses or is under significant medical or emotional stress, she can begin to have a loss of her menstrual periods. Malfunction of a particular part of the brain, called the hypothalamus, can cause oligomenorrhea. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder associated with excessive thinness that causes many serious medical consequences as well as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (the absence of menstrual periods). Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCO, PCOS, POS) is a hormonal problem that causes women to have a variety of symptoms that include irregular or no menstrual periods, acne, obesity, infertility, and excessive hair growth."
"What exams, procedures, and tests help diagnose the cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding?","   A woman who has irregular menstrual periods requires a physical examination with a special emphasis on the thyroid, breast, and pelvic area. During the pelvic examination, the physician attempts to detect cervical polyps or any unusual masses in the uterus or ovaries. A Pap smear is also done to rule out cervical cancer. While the Pap smear is being obtained, samples might be taken from the cervix to test for the presence of infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. A pregnancy test is routine if the woman is premenopausal. A blood count may be done to rule out a low blood count (anemia) resulting from excessive blood loss. If something in the patient's (or her family's) medical background or physical examination raises a doctor's suspicion, tests to rule out certain blood clotting disorders may be done. Sometimes, a blood sample will be tested to evaluate thyroid function, liver function, or kidney function abnormalities. A blood test for progesterone levels or daily body temperature charting may be recommended to verify that the woman ovulates. If the doctor suspects that the ovaries are failing, such as with menopause, blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be tested. Additional blood hormone tests are done if the doctor suspects polycystic ovary, or if excessive hair growth is present. A pelvic ultrasound is often performed based on the woman's medical history and pelvic examination. If a woman does not adequately respond to medical treatment, if she is over age 40, or if she has persistent vaginal bleeding between her periods, a sampling of the lining of her uterus (termed endometrial sampling or endometrial biopsy) is often analyzed. Endometrial sampling helps to rule out cancer or precancer in the uterus, or it can confirm a suspicion that a woman is not ovulating."
What are the treatments and cures for abnormal vaginal bleeding?,"'Treatment for irregular vaginal bleeding depends on the underlying cause. After the cause is determined, the doctor decides if treatment is actually necessary. Sometimes, all that is needed is for dangerous causes to be ruled out and to determine that the irregular vaginal bleeding does not bother the woman enough to warrant medication or treatment. If thyroid, ''liver'', kidney, or blood clotting problems are discovered, treatment is directed toward these conditions.''Medications for treatment of irregular vaginal bleeding depend on the cause. Examples are described below:''Many new procedures are being developed to treat certain types of irregular vaginal bleeding. For example, studies are underway to evaluate techniques that selectively block the blood vessels involved in the bleeding. These newer methods may be less complicated options for some patients and as they are further evaluated they will likely become more widely available.'   If the cause of the bleeding is lack of ovulation (anovulation), doctors may prescribe either progesterone to be taken at regular intervals, or an oral contraceptive, which contains progesterone, to achieve a proper hormonal balance. Such treatment dramatically decreases the risk of uterine cancer in women who do not ovulate. If the cause of irregular vaginal bleeding is a precancerous change in the lining of the uterus, progesterone medications may be prescribed to reduce the buildup of precancerous uterine lining tissues in an attempt to avoid surgery. When a woman has been without menses for less than six months and is bleeding irregularly, the cause may be that she is approaching menopause. During this transition, a woman is sometimes offered an oral contraceptive to establish a more regular bleeding pattern, to provide contraception until she achieves menopause (defined as 12 months without a menstrual period), and to relieve hot flashes. A woman who is found to be menopausal as the cause of her irregular bleeding may also receive menopause counseling if she has troubling symptoms. If the cause of irregular vaginal bleeding is polyps or other benign growths, these are sometimes removed surgically to control bleeding because they cannot be treated with medication. If the cause of bleeding is infection, antibiotics are necessary. Bleeding during pregnancy requires prompt evaluation by an obstetrician. Endometriosis can be treated with medications and/or surgery (such as laparoscopy). Sometimes, the cause of excessive bleeding is not apparent after completion of testing (dysfunctional uterine bleeding). In these cases, oral contraceptives can improve cycle control and lessen bleeding. If bleeding is excessive and cannot be controlled by medication, a surgical procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C) may be necessary. In addition to alleviating the excessive bleeding, the D&C provides tissue that can be analyzed for additional information that can rule out abnormalities of the lining of the uterus. Occasionally, a hysterectomy is necessary when hormonal medications cannot control excessive bleeding. However, unless the cause is pre-cancerous or cancerous, this surgery should only be an option after other solutions have been tried."
Vaginal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the vagina.,"'The vagina is the canal leading from the cervix (the opening of uterus) to the outside of the body. At birth, a baby passes out of the body through the vagina (also called the birth canal).''Vaginal cancer is not common. There are two main types of vaginal cancer:' Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that forms in squamous cells, the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Squamous cell vaginal cancer spreads slowly and usually stays near the vagina, but may spread to the lungs, liver, or bone. This is the most common type of vaginal cancer. Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that begins in glandular cells. Glandular cells in the lining of the vagina make and release fluids such as mucus. Adenocarcinoma is more likely than squamous cell cancer to spread to the lungs and lymph nodes. A rare type of adenocarcinoma is linked to being exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth. Adenocarcinomas that are not linked with being exposed to DES are most common in women after menopause."
Age and being exposed to the drug DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth affect a woman's risk of vaginal cancer.,"""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for vaginal cancer include the following:""   Being aged 60 or older. Being exposed to DES while in the mother's womb. In the 1950s, the drug DES was given to some pregnant women to prevent miscarriage (premature birth of a fetus that cannot survive). Women who were exposed to DES before birth have an increased risk of vaginal cancer. Some of these women develop a rare form of vaginal cancer called clear cell adenocarcinoma. Having human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Having a history of abnormal cells in the cervix or cervical cancer. Having a history of abnormal cells in the uterus or cancer of the uterus. Having had a hysterectomy for health problems that affect the uterus."
Signs and symptoms of vaginal cancer include pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding.,'Vaginal cancer often does not cause early signs or symptoms. It may be found during a routine pelvic exam and ''Pap test''. Signs and symptoms may be caused by vaginal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Bleeding or discharge not related to menstrual periods. Pain during sexual intercourse. Pain in the pelvic area. A lump in the vagina. Pain when urinating. Constipation.
Tests that examine the vagina and other organs in the pelvis are used to detect (find) and diagnose vaginal cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:'  Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. Pap test: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. This procedure is also called a Pap smear. Colposcopy: A procedure in which a colposcope (a lighted, magnifying instrument) is used to check the vagina and cervix for abnormal areas. Tissue samples may be taken using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) or a brush and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues from the vagina and cervix so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If a Pap test shows abnormal cells in the vagina, a biopsy may be done during a colposcopy."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:''When found in early stages, vaginal cancer can often be cured.''Treatment options depend on the following:' The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the vagina only or has spread to other areas). The size of the tumor. The grade of tumor cells (how different they look from normal cells under a microscope). Where the cancer is within the vagina. Whether there are signs or symptoms at diagnosis. The patient's age and general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). The stage and size of the cancer. Whether the cancer is close to other organs that may be damaged by treatment. Whether the tumor is made up of squamous cells or is an adenocarcinoma. Whether the patient has a uterus or has had a hysterectomy. Whether the patient has had past radiation treatment to the pelvis."
"After vaginal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the vagina or to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the vagina or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:' Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Cystoscopy: A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Ureteroscopy: A procedure to look inside the ureters to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is inserted through the bladder and into the ureters. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. A ureteroscopy and cystoscopy may be done during the same procedure. Proctoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum to check for abnormal areas. A proctoscope is inserted through the rectum. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Biopsy: A biopsy may be done to find out if cancer has spread to the cervix. A sample of tissue is removed from the cervix and viewed under a microscope. A biopsy that removes only a small amount of tissue is usually done in the doctor's office. A cone biopsy (removal of a larger, cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal) is usually done in the hospital. A biopsy of the vulva may also be done to see if cancer has spread there."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if vaginal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually vaginal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic vaginal cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
"In vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN), abnormal cells are found in 
tissue lining the inside of the vagina.","'These abnormal cells are not cancer. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is grouped based on how deep the abnormal cells are in the tissue lining the vagina:''VAIN may become cancer and spread into the vaginal wall. VAIN is sometimes called stage 0.' VAIN 1: Abnormal cells are found in the outermost one third of the tissue lining the vagina. VAIN 2: Abnormal cells are found in the outermost two-thirds of the tissue lining the vagina. VAIN 3: Abnormal cells are found in more than two-thirds of the tissue lining the vagina. When abnormal cells are found throughout the tissue lining, it is called carcinoma in situ."
The following stages are used for vaginal cancer:,"'In stage I, cancer is found in the vaginal wall only.''In stage II, cancer has spread through the wall of the vagina to the tissue around the vagina. Cancer has not spread to the wall of the pelvis.''In stage III, cancer has spread to the wall of the pelvis.''Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB:''Recurrent vaginal cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the vagina or in other parts of the body.' Stage IVA: Cancer may have spread to one or more of the following areas:The lining of the bladder.The lining of the rectum.Beyond the area of the pelvis that has the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and cervix. The lining of the bladder. The lining of the rectum. Beyond the area of the pelvis that has the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and cervix. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to parts of the body that are not near the vagina, such as the lung or bone."
There are different types of treatment for patients with vaginal cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with vaginal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Three types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is the most common treatment of vaginal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:''Skin grafting may follow surgery, to repair or reconstruct the vagina. Skin grafting is a surgical procedure in which skin is moved from one part of the body to another. A piece of healthy skin is taken from a part of the body that is usually hidden, such as the buttock or thigh, and used to repair or rebuild the area treated with surgery.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat vaginal cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Topical chemotherapy for squamous cell vaginal cancer may be applied to the vagina in a cream or lotion.'  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. Wide local excision: A surgical procedure that takes out the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. Vaginectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the vagina. Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. If the cancer is in the upper vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes may be removed. If the cancer is in the lower vagina, lymph nodes in the groin may be removed. Pelvic exenteration: Surgery to remove the lower colon, rectum, bladder, cervix, vagina, and ovaries. Nearby lymph nodes are also removed. Artificial openings (stoma) are made for urine and stool to flow from the body into a collection bag. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.,'This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.''Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.' 
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.' "
Treatment options by stage,"'Treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) 1 is usually watchful waiting.''Treatment of VAIN 2 and 3 may include the following:''Treatment of stage I squamous cell vaginal cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage I vaginal adenocarcinoma may include the following:''Treatment of stage II vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma.

This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Cystoscopy: A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Ureteroscopy: A procedure to look inside the ureters to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is inserted through the bladder and into the ureters. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. A ureteroscopy and cystoscopy may be done during the same procedure. Proctoscopy: A procedure to look inside the rectum to check for abnormal areas. A proctoscope is inserted through the rectum. A proctoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Biopsy: A biopsy may be done to find out if cancer has spread to the cervix. A sample of tissue is removed from the cervix and viewed under a microscope. A biopsy that removes only a small amount of tissue is usually done in the doctor's office. A cone biopsy (removal of a larger, cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal) is usually done in the hospital. A biopsy of the vulva may also be done to see if cancer has spread there."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if vaginal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually vaginal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic vaginal cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
"In vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN), abnormal cells are found in 
tissue lining the inside of the vagina.","'These abnormal cells are not cancer. Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is grouped based on how deep the abnormal cells are in the tissue lining the vagina:''VAIN may become cancer and spread into the vaginal wall. VAIN is sometimes called stage 0.' VAIN 1: Abnormal cells are found in the outermost one third of the tissue lining the vagina. VAIN 2: Abnormal cells are found in the outermost two-thirds of the tissue lining the vagina. VAIN 3: Abnormal cells are found in more than two-thirds of the tissue lining the vagina. When abnormal cells are found throughout the tissue lining, it is called carcinoma in situ."
The following stages are used for vaginal cancer:,"'In stage I, cancer is found in the vaginal wall only.''In stage II, cancer has spread through the wall of the vagina to the tissue around the vagina. Cancer has not spread to the wall of the pelvis.''In stage III, cancer has spread to the wall of the pelvis.''Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB:''Recurrent vaginal cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the vagina or in other parts of the body.' Stage IVA: Cancer may have spread to one or more of the following areas:The lining of the bladder.The lining of the rectum.Beyond the area of the pelvis that has the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and cervix. The lining of the bladder. The lining of the rectum. Beyond the area of the pelvis that has the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and cervix. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to parts of the body that are not near the vagina, such as the lung or bone."
There are different types of treatment for patients with vaginal cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with vaginal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Three types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is the most common treatment of vaginal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:''Skin grafting may follow surgery, to repair or reconstruct the vagina. Skin grafting is a surgical procedure in which skin is moved from one part of the body to another. A piece of healthy skin is taken from a part of the body that is usually hidden, such as the buttock or thigh, and used to repair or rebuild the area treated with surgery.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat vaginal cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Topical chemotherapy for squamous cell vaginal cancer may be applied to the vagina in a cream or lotion.'  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. Wide local excision: A surgical procedure that takes out the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. Vaginectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the vagina. Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. If the cancer is in the upper vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes may be removed. If the cancer is in the lower vagina, lymph nodes in the groin may be removed. Pelvic exenteration: Surgery to remove the lower colon, rectum, bladder, cervix, vagina, and ovaries. Nearby lymph nodes are also removed. Artificial openings (stoma) are made for urine and stool to flow from the body into a collection bag. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.,'This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.''Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.' 
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.' "
Treatment options by stage,"'Treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) 1 is usually watchful waiting.''Treatment of VAIN 2 and 3 may include the following:''Treatment of stage I squamous cell vaginal cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage I vaginal adenocarcinoma may include the following:''Treatment of stage II vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following:''Treatment of stage III vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following:''Treatment of stage IVA vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following:''Treatment of stage IVB vaginal cancer is the same for squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma. Treatment may include the following:''Although no anticancer drugs have been shown to help patients with stage IVB vaginal cancer live longer, they are often treated with regimens used for cervical cancer.''Treatment of recurrent vaginal cancer may include the following:''Although no anticancer drugs have been shown to help patients with recurrent vaginal cancer live longer, they are often treated with regimens used for cervical cancer.' Watchful waiting. Laser surgery. Wide local excision, with or without a skin graft. Partial or total vaginectomy, with or without a skin graft. Topical chemotherapy. Internal radiation therapy. A clinical trial of a new topical chemotherapy drug. Internal radiation therapy. External radiation therapy, especially for large tumors or the lymph nodes near tumors in the lower part of the vagina. Wide local excision or vaginectomy with vaginal reconstruction. Radiation therapy may be given after the surgery. Vaginectomy and lymph node dissection, with or without vaginal reconstruction. Radiation therapy may be given after the surgery. Vaginectomy, hysterectomy, and lymph node dissection. This may be followed by vaginal reconstruction and/or radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy. External radiation therapy may also be given to the lymph nodes near tumors in the lower part of the vagina. A combination of therapies that may include wide local excision with or without lymph node dissection and internal radiation therapy. Both internal and external radiation therapy to the vagina. External radiation therapy may also be given to the lymph nodes near tumors in the lower part of the vagina. Vaginectomy or pelvic exenteration. Internal and/or external radiation therapy may also be given. External radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy may also be given. Surgery (rare) followed by external radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy may also be given. External radiation therapy and/or internal radiation therapy. Surgery (rare) followed by external radiation therapy and/or internal radiation therapy. Radiation therapy as palliative therapy, to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life. Chemotherapy may also be given. A clinical trial of anticancer drugs and/or radiosensitizers. Pelvic exenteration. Radiation therapy. A clinical trial of anticancer drugs and/or radiosensitizers."
What is vaginal douching?,"'Douching is the practice of washing or flushing the vagina with water or other fluids. Vaginal douches are available as prepackaged mixes, most commonly involving water mixed with vinegar, baking soda, or ''iodine''. Douches are available at pharmacies and supermarkets.' "
Is vaginal douching necessary? Does it prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,"'The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women avoid the practice of vaginal douching. Most physicians also do not recommend douching. Douching can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina and can alter the normal pH of the vagina. Changes in the composition of the bacteria that normally reside within the vagina can lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections such as yeast infections. Douching can also cause the spread of harmful bacteria further up into the reproductive tract if an infection is already present in the vagina.''Women who ''douche'' state that they do so because they believe it offers health benefits, such as cleaning the vagina, rinsing away blood after menstrual periods, avoiding odor, and preventing ''pregnancy'' or infections. However, these beliefs are false, and douching is not necessary to “clean” the vagina. Douching also does not protect against pregnancy or against ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').' "
Can douching be harmful?,"'Yes, in some women, douching can lead to the spread of an infection or even the development of an infection by altering the balance of normal bacteria that are present in the vagina, as discussed previously. The risk of both ''bacterial vaginosis'' and sexually-transmitted diseases may be increased by douching. Douching can also cause vaginal irritation.' "
What is the best way to clean the vagina?,"'The vagina produces ''mucus'', which acts as a natural cleansing agent to wash away blood, semen, and ''vaginal discharge''. Washing the outside of the vagina with mild soap and water with regular bathing is sufficient for good hygiene.' "
"Can douching help relieve vaginal discharge, odor, pain, itching, or burning?","'An abnormal ''vaginal odor'', discharge, or discomfort can signal the presence of an infection, so douching to relieve the symptom would only avoid the underlying problem and might even make the infection worse. If you have abnormal ''vaginal odor'' or discharge, ''pain'', burning, or ''itching'"", it's important to see your health-care professional for diagnosis and treatment. Douching before the doctor's visit can make it more difficult to diagnose the problem and recommend the right therapy."" "
Can douching after sex prevent pregnancy?,"'No, douching after sex does not prevent pregnancy and should never be used as a method of ''birth control''.' "
Can douching after sex prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,'Douching after sex or at any time has no effect in preventing ''STDs''.' 
Can douching affect fertility or pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown that women who douche regularly take longer to become ''pregnant'' when ''trying to conceive'' than women who do not douche. Other research has shown that douching may damage the Fallopian tubes and lead to an increased risk of ''ectopic pregnancy'' (pregnancy outside the uterus).''In pregnant women, douching was shown in one study to increase the risk of preterm birth by a factor of 1.9.' "
Facts you should know about vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy," Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during the menopause (the time after menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Vaginal atrophy occurs due to falling estrogen levels. Vaginal atrophy may be associated with vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, and/or pain during sexual intercourse. Hormone therapy can be effective in treating vaginal atrophy and other menopausal symptoms, but hormone therapy carries its own risks. Local vaginal hormone creams or vaginal lubricants are alternatives to systemic hormone therapy."
What causes vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during ''menopause'' (the time when menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Prior to ''menopause'', the vaginal lining appears plump, bright red, and moist. As estrogen levels decline, the lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier, light pink to bluish in color, and less elastic. This is a normal change that is noticed by many perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women.''Estrogen levels begin to fall as the ''menopause'' approaches. ''Estrogens'' are mainly produced by the ovaries. ''Estrogens'' control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. Estrogens also play a significant role in the regulation of the ''menstrual cycle'' and ''pregnancy''.''Most women reach ''menopause'' between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can occur earlier or later in life. The ''menopause'' average age is 51 years old. Every woman is different, and there is no definitive way to predict when an individual woman will enter menopause. Also, women in the menopausal transition experience symptoms with varying degrees of severity. Not all perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women will have the same symptoms or experience the same levels of severity.'  "
What symptoms can be associated with vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Other vaginal symptoms that are commonly associated with vaginal atrophy include ''vaginal dryness'', ''itching'', irritation, and/or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse (known as dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections.''In addition to the vaginal symptoms, women may experience other symptoms of the menopausal transition. ''Hot flashes'', ''night sweats'', ''mood changes'', ''fatigue'',  ''urinary tract infections'', ''urinary incontinence'', ''acne'', memory problems, and unwanted hair growth. '  "
How do medical professionals diagnose vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal symptoms such as ''itching'', dryness, or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse are\xa0typically sufficient to assume that a woman is suffering from vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy if she is experiencing other symptoms consistent with the menopausal transition. Of course, a careful physical examination, including a pelvic examination, is necessary to rule out other conditions (such as infections) that may be causing vaginal symptoms.''There are no specific tests available to determine whether the vaginal wall has become thinner or less elastic.' "
What treatments are available for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal dryness and atrophy do not need to be treated unless they cause symptoms or discomfort. Women who experience symptoms have several treatment options.''Hormone therapy (HT) is effective in treating vaginal dryness/vaginal atrophy. HT has also been referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'') or postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT). HT has been shown to effectively reduce vaginal dryness as well as help control ''hot flashes'' associated with menopause.''However, HT is not without its risks. Long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women who took oral combined hormone therapy containing both estrogen and ''progesterone'' showed that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive it.''Women taking oral estrogen alone had an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for ''heart attack'' or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''HT may be administered in pill form or transdermally (patches or sprays from which the medication is absorbed through the skin). Transdermal\xa0estrogens enter the circulation directly, where oral estrogen products must first pass through the ''liver'' from the stomach. Since transdermal hormone products do not have effects on the ''liver'', this route of administration has become the preferred form for most women. A number of preparations are available for oral and transdermal forms of HT, varying in the both type and amount of hormones in the products.''So-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women has been a source of much attention in recent years. Bioidentical hormone preparations are hormones with the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body but which are produced in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. While some of these preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. Since individually compounded products cannot be standardized, these individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA. There is no evidence that bioidentical preparations provide superior symptom relief. Studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not yet been carried out.'""No matter what form of therapy is used, the decision about hormone therapy should take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history and the severity of her symptoms. Current recommendations state that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time.""'There are also local, topical (meaning applied directly to the vagina) low-dose hormonal treatments for the symptoms of vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Local treatments include the vaginal estrogen ring, vaginal estrogen cream, or vaginal estrogen tablets. Local (vaginal) estrogen treatments can be very effective in reducing vaginal dryness while having a minimal effect on other tissues in the body.''There is also now a product for vaginal dryness that consists of a daily pill which contains a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). These are theoretically safer than estrogens and can be alternative for some patients.''Vaginal moisturizing agents such as creams or lotions (for example, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer or KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer) as well as the use of lubricants during sexual intercourse are non-hormonal options for managing the discomfort of vaginal dryness. A longer acting moisturizer called Replens is also available over the counter.''Applying Betadine topically on the outer vaginal area, and soaking in a sitz bath or soaking in a bathtub of warm water may be helpful for relieving symptoms of burning and ''vaginal pain'' after intercourse.'  "
What is the prognosis for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"""Vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy are common complaints in postmenopausal women. While these conditions do not produce serious consequences, they are a source of significant discomfort for many women. Hormone treatments are available that are very effective in reducing vaginal dryness, but whether or not to use hormone therapy is an individual decision that must consider the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. Women with only mild symptoms may experience relief by using vaginal moisturizing agents and/or lubricants during sexual intercourse."" "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A ''hysterectomy'' is the removal of the uterus (womb). For certain conditions, the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. ''The most common medical reasons for doing a hysterectomy include benign ''fibroid'' tumors of the uterus, abnormal uterine bleeding, ''endometriosis'', genital prolapse, and chronic ''pelvic pain''. Some women choose to have a hysterectomy for other reasons, including other types of tumors. ''Uterine cancer'' is an uncommon, but important reason for doing a hysterectomy.' "
What is a laparoscope?,"'A laparoscope is a viewing tube through which structures within the abdomen and pelvis can be seen. A small surgical incision (cut) is made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the abdomen or pelvis. Additional tubes can also be pushed through the same or other small incisions allowing the introduction of probes and other instruments. In this way, surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision.' "
What is laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)?,"'Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical procedure using a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). (A different procedure, called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, is entirely performed using a laparoscope and other instruments inserted through tiny abdominal incisions, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes etc. are removed in tiny portions.) ''Not all hysterectomies can or should be done by LAVH. In certain situations, a laparoscopic hysterectomy (see above) may be sufficient. In other cases, an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal hysterectomy (without ''laparoscopy'') is indicated. The surgeon determines the appropriate procedure for each individual case based upon the reason for the hysterectomy and the medical history and condition of the patient.' "
How do doctors perform an LAVH?,"'During LAVH, several small incisions (''cuts'') are made in the abdominal wall through which slender metal tubes known as ""trocars"" are inserted to provide passage for a laparoscope and other microsurgical tools. The laparoscope acts as a tiny telescope. A camera attached to it provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen for viewing.''In the course of LAVH, the uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other structures in the pelvis using the laparoscopic tools. If the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are also detached from their ligaments and blood supply. The organs and tissue are then removed through an incision made in the vagina.' "
What are the disadvantages of LAVH?,"'LAVH can be a longer operation and more expensive than a vaginal hysterectomy and, under certain circumstances, it can be more dangerous.' "
What are the advantages of LAVH?,"'The incisions in an LAVH are relatively small. The ''scars'', ''pain'', and recovery time from LAVH are usually significantly less than with an abdominal hysterectomy, which requires both a vaginal incision and a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) long incision in the abdomen). LAVH is similarly less physically traumatic than a routine vaginal hysterectomy. When LAVH is feasible, it has distinct advantages. It can allow for a vaginal hysterectomy in patients who have not had children.' "
What is trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is a ''sexually transmitted infection'' (STI) caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread most often through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It is one of the most common STIs in the United States and affects more women than men. It is easily treated with antibiotics, but many women do not have symptoms. If left untreated, trichomoniasis can raise your risk of getting ''HIV''.'  "
How do you get trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is spread through:' Vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Trichomoniasis can be spread even if there are no symptoms. This means you can get trichomoniasis from someone who has no signs or symptoms. Genital touching. A man does not need to ejaculate (come) for trichomoniasis to spread. Trichomoniasis can also be passed bet"
Who gets trichomoniasis?,'Trichomoniasis is more common in women than men. It affects more than 2 million women ages 14 to 49 in the United States.''Trichomoniasis affects more African-American women than white and Hispanic women. The risk for African-American women goes up with age and lifetime number of sex partners' 
What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?,"'Most infected women have no signs or symptoms. If you do get signs or symptoms, they might appear five to 28 days after exposure and can include:''If you think you may have trichomoniasis, you and your sex partner(s) need to see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.'   Irritation and itching in the genital area Thin or frothy discharge (clear, white, yellowish, or greenish) with an unusual foul odor Discomfort during sex and when urinating Lower abdominal pain (this is rare)"
Is there a test to diagnose trichomoniasis?,"'To find out whether you have trichomoniasis, your doctor or nurse may:''A ''Pap test'' is not used to detect trichomoniasis.''If you have trichomoniasis, you need to be tested for other STIs too.'   Do a pelvic exam Use a cotton swab to take a fluid sample from your vagina to look for the parasite under a microscope Do a lab test, such as a DNA test or a fluid culture. A culture tests uses urine or a swab from your vagina. The parasite then grows in a lab. It takes up to a week for the parasite to grow enough to be seen."
What is the treatment to cure trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis us easily cured with one of two antibiotics:''These antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow in a single dose.''If you are treated for trichomoniasis, your sex partner(s) needs to be treated too. Do not have sex until you and your sex partner(s) finish taking all of the antibiotics and have no symptoms.'   
Metronidazole (me-truh-NYD-uh-zohl) 
	 Tinidazole (teye-NID-uh-zohl)"
What can happen if trichomoniasis is not treated?," Most people with trichomoniasis have no symptoms and never know they have it. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. If you have trichomoniasis, you are at higher risk of getting HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) if you are exposed to HIV. 
	 If you are 
	HIV-positive, having trichomoniasis also raises your risk of passing HIV to your sex partner(s). 
	 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women with HIV get screened for trichomoniasis at least once a year."
What should I do if I have trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is easy to treat. But you need to be tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have trichomoniasis:'   See a doctor or nurse as soon as possible. Antibiotics will treat trichomoniasis. Take all of your medicine. Even if symptoms go away, you need to finish all of the antibiotics. Tell your sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Avoid sexual contact until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured. Even after you finish your antibiotics, you can get trichomoniasis again if you have sex with someone who has trichomoniasis. See your doctor or nurse again if you have symptoms that don’t go away within a few days after finishing the antibiotics."
Does trichomoniasis affect pregnancy?,'''Pregnant'' women with trichomoniasis are at higher risk of premature birth (''babies'' born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Premature birth and a low birth weight raise the risk of health and developmental problems at birth and later in life.''The antibiotic metronidazole can be used to treat trichomoniasis during any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking any medicine during pregnancy.'  
Can I take medicine to cure trichomoniasis if I am breastfeeding?,'You can take the antibiotic metronidazole if you are ''breastfeeding''. Your doctor may suggest waiting 12 to 24 hours after taking metronidazole before breastfeeding. Do not take tinidazole if you are breastfeeding.' 
How can I prevent trichomoniasis?,"'The best way to prevent trichomoniasis or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:''The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI.' Use condoms. Condoms are the best way to prevent STIs when you have sex. Because a man does not need to ejaculate (come) to give or get trichomoniasis, make sure to put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth, or anus. Other methods of birth control, like birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STIs. Get tested. Be sure you and your partner are tested for STIs. Talk to each other about the test results before you have sex. Be monogamous. Having sex with just one partner can lower your risk for STIs. After being tested for STIs, be faithful to each other. That means that you have sex only with each other and no one else. Limit your number of sex partners. Your risk of getting STIs goes up with the number of partners you have. Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protects you from infection. This may increase your risk of getting STIs. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much alcohol or using drugs increases risky behavior and may put you at risk of sexual assault and possible exposure to STIs."
Can women who have sex with women get trichomoniasis?,"'Yes. It is possible to get trichomoniasis, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women.''Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of trichomoniasis.' "
What is vaginal pain (vulvodynia)?,"'Vulvodynia refers to pain in the area of the vulva and vaginal opening. Vulvodynia is considered pain for which there is no known cause. It is different from pain that is located deep in the pelvis or internally in the vagina. ''This article focuses on pain in the vulvar region and at the opening (introitus) of the vagina. ''Deeper vaginal pain can also occur due to infections, tumors, and conditions that cause more generalized pain in the pelvic organs.' Vaginal pain can be chronic and can last for years in some women. The degree of severity varies among women. It often occurs in the absence of physical signs or visible abnormalities. It can be severe and can interfere with sexual activity and cause painful intercourse (dyspareunia). However, there are a number of other causes of vaginal pain during or after sex."
What are the signs and symptoms of vaginal pain?,"'The pain of vulvodynia can be debilitating and interfere with daily activities and sexual intercourse. It can make women feel a loss of control their bodies, causing profound emotional and physical discomfort.''Symptoms of vulvodynia and vaginal pain may include:''Some women report pain that is localized to one side or one area of the vulva, while others have more generalized and widespread pain. Usually, no physical signs or changes occur in and around the vagina with vulvodynia; however, sometimes the skin may be inflamed.'   Burning or stinging pain in the vulva or vaginal opening Sharp, aching, or throbbing pain in the vagina or vulva Vaginal itching, sometimes with pain Pain that is constant or comes and goes Pain that occurs during sex or exercise"
What if you have vaginal pain during pregnancy?,'Vaginal pain may occur during the ''third trimester'' of ''pregnancy'' due to an increase in pressure on the cervix. Women who experienced vulvodynia before ''becoming pregnant'' may continue to experience this symptom during pregnancy.'  
What causes vaginal pain?,"'It is unclear why some women develop vulvodynia. It is not thought to be related to sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''), although some women with vulvodynia have had multiple STDs. Some theories suggest that vulvodynia may be related to''Familial or genetic factors also have been suggested to play a role in vulvodynia. Unfortunately, the exact cause has not been determined and most women have no known contributing factors.' damage or irritation of nerves, abnormal responses to irritation or inflammation, allergic reactions, muscle spasms, a history of sexual abuse, or frequent use of antibiotics."
What are risk factors for vaginal pain? Who gets it?,"'Since the cause is poorly understood, it is difficult to predict who is at risk for vulvodynia. It can affect women of all ages and races. It can begin as early as adolescence and can occur both before and after ''menopause''. It may occur during the ''menstrual period'' or independent of the menstrual period.' "
What exams and procedures can diagnose the cause of vaginal paint?,"'No specific tests confirm vulvodynia. Usually, vaginal pain and vulvodynia are diagnosed based upon the characteristic symptoms of the condition. However, since vulvar and vaginal infections, (for example, yeast infections, ''bacterial vaginosis'', and ''vaginitis'') are associated with vaginal burning and ''itching'', cultures or other diagnostic tests may be ordered to rule out vaginal infections.' "
What is the treatment for vaginal pain and vulvodynia? Can the condition be cured?,"'Vulvodynia is a chronic condition (it may last for months to years) in some women; in others, it may come and go. Vulvodynia and vaginal pain can be managed using medical treatments and self-care (home remedies). Not all treatments will be effective for every woman, and a woman may have to try different treatments to find the most effective option for her.''Vulvodynia is not associated with ''cancer'' or with any serious medical diseases, but it may be a source of ''chronic pain'' and emotional discomfort for some women.'  "
What medications and home therapies can relieve vaginal pain?,"'Some of the medications that have been useful include:''Other medical therapies for women with severe vulvodynia include:'   Topical estrogen creams Topical or local anesthetics Tricyclic antidepressants Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications are sometimes useful in managing chronic pain) Injections of interferon or nerve blocks, in which medications are injected to reduce signaling from nerves in the affected areas Biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercises have been helpful for some women. Surgical removal of affected tissue can be of benefit in women with vulvodynia due to vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, a particular type of vulvodynia that is located at the area of the hymenal ring."
What treatments and home remedies help relieve pain?,"'Home remedies and self-care measures for vulvodynia can bring relief for many women. Some self-care measures to relieve the pain of vulvodynia include:'   Rinsing the area with cool water, particularly after urination and sexual activity Soaking in cool or warm sitz baths Using topical ice packs wrapped in a towel Heating pad use, in contrast, may help some women Using mild, unscented soaps and detergent Using white, unscented toilet tissue Wearing white cotton underwear Wearing loose-fitting clothing and avoiding stockings or pantyhose Avoiding pools or hot tubs with chlorinated water Using a water-soluble lubricant during sexual intercourse Avoiding activities such as bicycling, that put pressure on the vulvar area Keeping the vulvar area dry and clean Avoiding food that can make the urine more irritating to the skin of the genital area. These foods include beans, berries, nuts, and chocolate Over-the-counter antihistamines can help reduce itching, particularly at night"
What is vaginitis?,"'Vaginitis refers to inflammation of the vagina that often occurs in combination with inflammation of the vulva, a condition known as vulvovaginitis. Vaginitis is often the result of an infection with yeast, bacteria, or ''Trichomonas'', but it may also arise due to physical or chemical irritation of the area. Not all infections that cause vaginitis are considered sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''), but some STDs cause vaginitis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of vaginitis?,"'Vaginitis causes irritation of the vagina that can result in;''It is also possible to have vaginitis or an ''STD'' without experiencing any symptoms.'   burning, itching, pain, vaginal discharge, pain during sexual intercourse or urination, and vaginal odor."
How do you get vaginitis? What causes it?,"'Infectious causes of vaginitis include bacteria, yeast, and ''Trichomonas''.''Vaginitis in young girls has also been described and is thought to arise from ''poor hygiene'' practices that allow the spread of fecal bacteria from the anal area into the vagina.'   Bacterial vaginosis is the most common bacterial infection that causes vaginitis. This condition results from an imbalance in the bacteria normally present in the vagina. It is not clear if sexual activity plays a role in the development of bacterial vaginosis, and some experts believe it can occur in women who have not had sexual contact. The STDs gonorrhea and Chlamydia are other bacterial causes of vaginitis. Yeast infections, such as Candida infection, are a common cause of vaginitis. Yeast infections are not considered to be STDs. Trichomonas (""Trich"") is a parasitic infection that is transmitted through sexual contact. Non-infectious causes of vaginitis include physical or chemical irritation, such as:Douches, soaps, or fragrancesSpermicidesReduced estrogen levels around the time of menopause Douches, soaps, or fragrances Spermicides Reduced estrogen levels around the time of menopause"
What are the risk factors for vaginitis?,"'The risk factors for vaginitis depend upon the type of vaginitis.''Risk factors for ''STDs'' include multiple sexual partners and unprotected intercourse.''Some of the known risk factors for ''bacterial vaginosis'' include ''cigarette smoking'', multiple sex partners, ''douching'', and using IUDs for ''contraception''.''Risk factors for ''yeast infection'' are varied. They can include suppression of the immune system either due to ''cancer'' or other conditions, or by taking immune-suppressing medications. Antibiotic use is another known risk factor. ''Pregnancy'', ''diabetes'', taking ''oral contraceptives'"", and douching can all increase a woman's likelihood of developing yeast vaginitis."" "
Which tests diagnose vaginitis?,"'The symptoms and signs of vaginitis strongly suggest the diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, a pelvic examination is typically performed that may include removal of a sample of vaginal discharge. The sample may be viewed under the microscope to look for ''Trichomonas'' organisms, or it may be sent to a laboratory for culture or other specialized tests to identify infectious organisms.' "
What is the treatment for vaginitis?,"'The treatment for vaginitis depends upon its cause. Infectious vaginitis is treated with antibiotic medications. Bacterial vaginitis is treated with either oral antibiotics, intra-vaginal antibiotic creams, or injections (shots) of antibiotics. Treatment guidelines are always updated to reflect the patterns of resistance to antibiotics of circulating bacterial ''strains''.' "
What medications treat vaginitis?,"'Antibiotics that may be used in the management of ''bacterial vaginosis'' include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), ''erythromycin'', ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''), ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), ''cefixime'' (''Suprax''), ''doxycycline'' (Doryx), and ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'').''Antifungal medications are used to treat ''yeast infections'', and antifungal preparations are available ''over-the-counter'' for yeast vaginitis. Examples of antifungal medications include ''fluconazole'', ''terconazole'' (''Terazol''), ''clotrimazole'' (''Gyne-Lotrimin''), ''miconazole'' (''Monistat''), butoconazole (Gynazole), and ''Nystatin''.''Metronidazole (Flagyl) is the drug of choice for treating ''T''richomonas'' infections''.''Vaginitis due to infections cannot be cured by home remedies. However, many women find that home care strategies can help control unpleasant symptoms. These include allowing air to circulate around the vagina when possible by wearing loose, cotton undergarments and clothing. Removing undergarments at night may also be helpful.''Vaginitis due to thinning and irritation of the vaginal wall as a result of lowered estrogen levels at ''menopause'' can be treated with hormonal therapy, either in topical (applied directly to the vagina) or oral form. Non-hormonal vaginal lubricant products are also available.'  "
Can vaginitis be cured? What if it is not treated?,"'Most cases of vaginitis do not cause long-term problems when properly treated. If untreated, vaginal infections may spread to other pelvic organs, a condition known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID). PID can be serious and result in impaired ''fertility''. Sometimes, vaginitis recurs even after successful treatment, and another course of treatment is necessary.''STDs that occur in ''pregnant'' women should also be promptly treated to avoid complications for the mother or baby.' "
Can vaginitis be prevented?,'Vaginitis due to STDs can be prevented by practicing ''safe sex'' or abstinence. It is not possible to prevent all cases of ''yeast infection'' or bacterial vaginosis. Attention to hygiene practices and avoiding spread of fecal material to the vagina may help prevent vaginitis in young girls.' 
What is trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is a ''sexually transmitted infection'' (STI) caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread most often through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It is one of the most common STIs in the United States and affects more women than men. It is easily treated with antibiotics, but many women do not have symptoms. If left untreated, trichomoniasis can raise your risk of getting ''HIV''.'  "
How do you get trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is spread through:' Vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Trichomoniasis can be spread even if there are no symptoms. This means you can get trichomoniasis from someone who has no signs or symptoms. Genital touching. A man does not need to ejaculate (come) for trichomoniasis to spread. Trichomoniasis can also be passed bet"
Who gets trichomoniasis?,'Trichomoniasis is more common in women than men. It affects more than 2 million women ages 14 to 49 in the United States.''Trichomoniasis affects more African-American women than white and Hispanic women. The risk for African-American women goes up with age and lifetime number of sex partners' 
What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?,"'Most infected women have no signs or symptoms. If you do get signs or symptoms, they might appear five to 28 days after exposure and can include:''If you think you may have trichomoniasis, you and your sex partner(s) need to see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.'   Irritation and itching in the genital area Thin or frothy discharge (clear, white, yellowish, or greenish) with an unusual foul odor Discomfort during sex and when urinating Lower abdominal pain (this is rare)"
Is there a test to diagnose trichomoniasis?,"'To find out whether you have trichomoniasis, your doctor or nurse may:''A ''Pap test'' is not used to detect trichomoniasis.''If you have trichomoniasis, you need to be tested for other STIs too.'   Do a pelvic exam Use a cotton swab to take a fluid sample from your vagina to look for the parasite under a microscope Do a lab test, such as a DNA test or a fluid culture. A culture tests uses urine or a swab from your vagina. The parasite then grows in a lab. It takes up to a week for the parasite to grow enough to be seen."
What is the treatment to cure trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis us easily cured with one of two antibiotics:''These antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow in a single dose.''If you are treated for trichomoniasis, your sex partner(s) needs to be treated too. Do not have sex until you and your sex partner(s) finish taking all of the antibiotics and have no symptoms.'   
Metronidazole (me-truh-NYD-uh-zohl) 
	 Tinidazole (teye-NID-uh-zohl)"
What can happen if trichomoniasis is not treated?," Most people with trichomoniasis have no symptoms and never know they have it. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. If you have trichomoniasis, you are at higher risk of getting HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) if you are exposed to HIV. 
	 If you are 
	HIV-positive, having trichomoniasis also raises your risk of passing HIV to your sex partner(s). 
	 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women with HIV get screened for trichomoniasis at least once a year."
What should I do if I have trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is easy to treat. But you need to be tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have trichomoniasis:'   See a doctor or nurse as soon as possible. Antibiotics will treat trichomoniasis. Take all of your medicine. Even if symptoms go away, you need to finish all of the antibiotics. Tell your sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Avoid sexual contact until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured. Even after you finish your antibiotics, you can get trichomoniasis again if you have sex with someone who has trichomoniasis. See your doctor or nurse again if you have symptoms that don’t go away within a few days after finishing the antibiotics."
Does trichomoniasis affect pregnancy?,'''Pregnant'' women with trichomoniasis are at higher risk of premature birth (''babies'' born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Premature birth and a low birth weight raise the risk of health and developmental problems at birth and later in life.''The antibiotic metronidazole can be used to treat trichomoniasis during any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking any medicine during pregnancy.'  
Can I take medicine to cure trichomoniasis if I am breastfeeding?,'You can take the antibiotic metronidazole if you are ''breastfeeding''. Your doctor may suggest waiting 12 to 24 hours after taking metronidazole before breastfeeding. Do not take tinidazole if you are breastfeeding.' 
How can I prevent trichomoniasis?,"'The best way to prevent trichomoniasis or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:''The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI.' Use condoms. Condoms are the best way to prevent STIs when you have sex. Because a man does not need to ejaculate (come) to give or get trichomoniasis, make sure to put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth, or anus. Other methods of birth control, like birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STIs. Get tested. Be sure you and your partner are tested for STIs. Talk to each other about the test results before you have sex. Be monogamous. Having sex with just one partner can lower your risk for STIs. After being tested for STIs, be faithful to each other. That means that you have sex only with each other and no one else. Limit your number of sex partners. Your risk of getting STIs goes up with the number of partners you have. Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protects you from infection. This may increase your risk of getting STIs. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much alcohol or using drugs increases risky behavior and may put you at risk of sexual assault and possible exposure to STIs."
Can women who have sex with women get trichomoniasis?,"'Yes. It is possible to get trichomoniasis, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women.''Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of trichomoniasis.' "
What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Bacterial vaginosis also is referred to as nonspecific ''vaginitis'', is a vaginal condition that can produce vaginal discharge and results from an overgrowth of certain kinds of bacteria in the vagina. In the past, the condition was called ''Gardnerella'' ''vaginitis'', after the bacteria that were thought to cause the condition. However, the newer name, bacterial vaginosis, reflects the fact that there are a number of species of bacteria that naturally live in the vaginal area and may grow to excess, rather than a true infection with foreign bacteria, such as occurs with many sexually-transmitted disease (''STDs'').''The ''Gardnerella ''organism is not the sole type of bacteria causing the symptoms. Other kinds of bacteria that can be involved in bacterial vaginosis are ''Lactobacillus'', Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium'', as well as a number of other types. When these multiple species of bacteria that normally reside in the vagina become unbalanced, a woman can have a vaginal discharge with a foul odor.' "
What are signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Many women with bacterial vaginosis have no signs or symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, the most common include:''Symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, if present, can occur any time in the ''menstrual cycle'', including before, during, or after the ''menstrual period''. The amount of vaginal discharge that is considered normal varies from woman to woman. Therefore, any degree of vaginal discharge that is abnormal for a particular woman should be evaluated.'   An abnormal amount of vaginal discharge The vaginal discharge is thin and grayish white. Vaginal odor (foul-smelling or unpleasant fishy odor) The vaginal discharge and odor are often more noticeable after sexual intercourse. Pain with sexual intercourse or urination (rare symptoms)."
What causes bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Researchers have had difficulty determining exactly what causes bacterial vaginosis. At present, it seems to be that a combination of multiple bacteria must be present together for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Bacterial vaginosis typically features a reduction in the number of the normal hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli in the vagina. Simultaneously, there is an increase in concentration of other types of bacteria, especially anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that grow in the absence of oxygen). As a result, the diagnosis and treatment are not as simple as identifying and eradicating a single type of bacteria. Why the bacteria combine to cause the unbalance is unknown.''Certain risk factors have been identified that increase the chances of developing bacterial vaginosis. These risk factors for BV include:''However, the role of sexual activity in the development of the condition is not fully understood, and although most experts believe that bacterial vaginosis does not occur in women who have not had sexual intercourse, others feel that the condition can still develop in women who have not had sexual intercourse.'   multiple or new sexual partners, IUDs (intrauterine devices) for birth control, recent antibiotic use, vaginal douching, and cigarette smoking."
How common is bacterial vaginosis (BV)? Is it an STD or yeast infection?," Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition. It is the most common vaginal complaint in women of childbearing age. Studies have shown that approximately 29% of women in the U.S. are affected. Bacterial vaginosis is found in about 25% of pregnant women in the U.S. and approximately 60% of women who have an STD. Bacterial vaginosis is not the same thing as an STD or yeast infection. Bacterial vaginosis is not dangerous, but it can cause disturbing symptoms. Any woman with an unusual discharge should be evaluated so that more serious infections such as Chlamydia and gonorrhea can be excluded. Symptoms may also mimic those found in yeast infections of the vagina and trichomoniasis (an STD), and these conditions must also be excluded in women with vaginal symptoms."
Can you get bacterial vaginosis (BV) from a sexual partner?,"'The term ""vaginosis"" refers to a vaginal abnormality; therefore a male cannot ""get"" bacterial vaginosis. However, female sex partners of women with bacterial vaginosis may want to consider being evaluated because it can spread to female partners.' "
Is bacterial vaginosis contagious (BV)?,"'Although'' bacterial vaginosis is not considered to be a ''contagious'' condition'"", the role of transmissibility of bacteria among individuals is not fully understood. Since having multiple or new sexual partners increases a woman's risk of developing bacterial vaginosis, this suggests that spread of bacteria among individuals may alter the balance of bacteria in the vagina and potentially predispose to development of bacterial vaginosis. However, since bacterial vaginosis also occurs in celibate women, other causative factors must also play a role in its development.""'It is not possible to contract bacterial vaginosis from toilet seats, ''swimming'' pools, or hot tubs, or from touching contaminated objects.' "
"Is there a test to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV)? What is the ""whiff test?""","'When a woman notices an unusual vaginal discharge and reports this to her doctor, he or she will ask her a series of routine questions to help distinguish mild from more serious conditions. Additional issues that might indicate the presence of a more serious condition include:''In addition to these questions, the doctor will perform a ''pelvic exam''. During the exam, the doctor notes the appearance of the vaginal lining and cervix. The doctor will also perform a manual exam of the ovaries and uterus. The cervix is examined for tenderness, which might indicate a more serious infection. The doctor may collect samples to check for ''Chlamydia'' or gonorrhea infection.''Examining the vaginal discharge under the microscope can help distinguish bacterial vaginosis from infections such as yeast vaginitis (vaginal ''yeast infection'', ''Candidiasis'') and ''trichomoniasis''. A sign of bacterial vaginosis under the microscope is a vaginal cell called a clue cell. Clue cells are vaginal cells covered with bacteria and are believed to be the most reliable diagnostic sign of bacterial vaginosis. In addition to clue cells, women with bacterial vaginosis have fewer of the normal vaginal bacteria, called ''lactobacilli''. A vaginal pH greater than 4.5 is also suggestive of bacterial vaginosis. Cultures of bacteria are generally not useful in establishing the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis since it is caused by bacteria that are normally present in the vagina.''During the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis the doctor may perform a ""whiff test"" with potassium hydroxide (KOH) liquid. When a drop of KOH testing liquid used in the ""whiff test"" contacts a drop of the discharge from a woman with bacterial vaginosis, a certain fishy odor can result.' fever, pelvic pain, new or multiple sexual partners (especially with unprotected intercourse), and a history of sexually-transmitted infections (STDs)."
Can bacterial vaginosis (BV) be treated and cured with home remedies?,"'There are no home remedies or natural remedies for bacterial vaginosis. Antibiotics are the only treatment. It is important to note that douching (rinsing the interior of the vagina) will not help with BV, and here is no proven medical benefit of douching. In fact, douching may ''flush'' bacteria farther up the genital tract into the uterus or Fallopian tubes, potentially worsening the condition.''Studies of yogurt/lactobacilli ''probiotic'' preparations (either taken orally or applied to the vagina), which are designed to help reestablish the lactobacilli population in the vagina, have not shown consistent results in treating bacterial vaginosis.' "
What medicine treats bacterial vaginosis and reccurent BV? Can antibiotics cure it?,"'Bacterial vaginosis can be cured with antibiotics. Even after a woman has been cured, however, BV often recurs. A second course of antibiotics is necessary if a woman experiences recurrent bacterial vaginosis that produces symptoms.''Antibiotics are the recommended treatment for bacterial vaginosis. A few antibiotic remedies are routinely used and include:''Recurrence of bacterial vaginosis is possible even after successful treatment. More than half of those treated experience recurrent symptoms within 12 months. It is unclear why so many recurrent infections develop. With recurrent symptoms, a second course of antibiotics is generally prescribed.''Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is recommended to decrease the risk of pregnancy-associated complications related to infection. Treatment prior to Cesarean delivery, total abdominal ''hysterectomy'', and insertion of an ''IUD'' is also recommended by most experts.' metronidazole (Flagyl) taken by either oral (pill) form or vaginal metronidazole gel (Metrogel). The oral metronidazole can cause some minor but unpleasant side effects, but is believed to be the most effective treatment. The gels do not typically cause side effects, although yeast vaginitis can occur as a side effect of the medication. vaginal clindamycin cream (Cleocin) tinidazole (Tindamax) is an antibiotic that appears to be effective in treating bacterial vaginosis, and may have fewer side effects than metronidazole."
What is the treatment for recurrent BV? How is it treated during pregnancy?,"'While up to 1/3 of cases of bacterial vaginosis may resolve on their own, it is recommended that medical treatment be given if symptoms are present or during pregnancy to avoid the development of complications.''Bacterial vaginosis may recur even after successful treatment. More than half of those treated experience recurrent symptoms within 12 months. It is unclear why so many recurrences develop. With recurrent symptoms, a second course of antibiotics is generally prescribed.\xa0Recurrent bacterial vaginosis may develop in the same woman after she has been treated so it is important to see a doctor if symptoms persist or recur. Up to 50% of women who are treated will develop a recurrence of symptoms in the year following treatment.''Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is recommended to decrease the risk of pregnancy-associated complications related to infection. Treatment prior to Cesarean delivery, total abdominal hysterectomy, and insertion of an IUD is also recommended by most experts.''A return visit to your doctor is recommended if the your symptoms do not resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if symptoms return.'

What are the complications of bacterial vaginosis (BV)?,"'Bacterial vaginosis can resolve completely without complications after treatment. No special follow-up is necessary if the symptoms disappear.''Women with bacterial vaginosis are at increased risk for contracting ''HIV'' infection as well as other STDs including ''genital herpes'', gonorrhea, and Chlamydia.''In pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis has been linked to premature ''labor'', but the exact relationship is still not clear. BV has also been linked to miscarriages and other problems, so treatment during pregnancy is advised.'  "
Can bacterial vaginosis (BV) be prevented?,"""Because the cause and development of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, it can be difficult to take measures to prevent it from occurring. Reducing certain risk factors, such as limiting the number of sex partners, avoiding the use of vaginal douches, and taking all medications as directed when being treated for bacterial vaginosis, can help reduce a woman's risk of developing bacterial vaginosis, and help reduce a woman's risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.""

Which types of doctor treats bacterial vaginosis?,"'Bacterial vaginosis is typically managed by a gynecologist. It can also be treated by primary care providers such as family practitioners, internal medicine doctors, and pediatricians.' "
What is the vagus nerve?,"'The vagus nerve is a nerve that supply nerve fibers to the pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), lungs, heart, esophagus, and intestinal tract, as far as the transverse portion of the colon. The vagus nerve also brings sensory information back to the brain from the ear, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. The vagus nerve is the tenth cranial nerve. It originates in the medulla oblongata, a part of the brain stem, and extends all the way down from the brain stem to the colon. Complete interruption of the vagus nerve causes a characteristic syndrome in which the soft palate droops on the side where damage occurred, and the gag reflex is also lost on that side. The voice is hoarse and nasal, and the vocal cord on the affected side is immobile. The result is ''difficulty swallowing'' (''dysphagia'') and speaking (dysphonia). The vagus nerve has several important branches, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve.''Some cranial nerves bring information from the senses (like touch or sight) to the brain (sensory) and some control muscles (motor). Other cranial nerves, like the vagus, have both motor and sensory functions. The vagus nerve serves many organs and structures, including the larynx (voice box), lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract.' "
What is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)?,"'Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a technique used to treat ''epilepsy''. It involves implanting a pacemaker-like device that generates pulses of electricity to stimulate the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves, the paired nerves that attach to the undersurface of the brain and relay information to and from the brain. Cranial nerve fibers conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and various body structures, mostly in the head and neck. The vagus nerve - the longest of the cranial nerves - also extends to organs in the chest and abdomen. (The word vagus comes from a Latin word for ""wandering.\')' "
What are the side effects of VNS?,"'The most common side effects of VNS include:''Usually, these occur only when the nerve is being stimulated, and are generally mild and tend to go away over time.' Hoarseness Coughing Tingling in the neck and Problems swallowing"
When is VNS used to treat epilepsy?," Brain cells communicate by sending electrical signals in an orderly pattern. In people with epilepsy, this pattern is sometimes disrupted due either to an injury or the person's genetic make-up, causing brain cells to emit signals in an uncontrolled fashion. This creates over-excitement, somewhat like an electrical overload in the brain, leading to seizures. Seizures can be produced by electrical impulses from throughout the brain, called generalized seizures, or from a small area of the brain, called partial seizures. Most people with epilepsy can control their seizures with medications called anti-convulsant or anti-seizure drugs. About 20% of people with epilepsy do not respond to anti-seizure medications. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be used. VNS may be a treatment option for people whose seizures are not controlled by anti-seizure medications and who are not considered good candidates for surgery; for example, if their seizures are produced throughout the brain (generalized)."
How does VNS work?,"'It is not known exactly how VNS works. It is known, however, that the vagus nerve is an important pathway to the brain. It is thought that by stimulating the vagus nerve, electrical energy is discharged upward into a wide area of the brain, disrupting the abnormal brain activity responsible for seizures. Another theory suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve causes the release of special brain chemicals that decrease seizure activity.' "
What happens during VNS? How is it performed?,"'While the patient is asleep (general anesthesia), the stimulator device (that is about the size of a silver dollar) is surgically placed under the skin in the upper part of the chest. A connecting wire is run under the skin from the stimulator to an electrode that is attached to the vagus nerve, which is accessible through a small incision (cut) in the neck.'""After it is implanted, the stimulator is programmed using a computer to generate pulses of electricity at regular intervals, depending on the patient's tolerance. For example, the device may be programmed to stimulate the nerve for 30 seconds every five minutes. The settings on the device are adjustable, and the electrical current is gradually increased as the patient's tolerance increases. Re-programming the stimulator can be done in the doctor's office. The patient also is given a hand-held magnet, which when brought near the stimulator, can generate an immediate current of electricity to stop a seizure in progress or reduce the severity of the seizure.""'VNS is an add-on therapy, which means it is used in addition to another type of treatment. Patients who undergo VNS continue to take their seizure medications. In some cases, however, it may be possible to reduce the dosage of medication.' "
What are the risks of VNS?,"'The risks of VNS include injury to the vagus nerve or nearby blood vessels, including the carotid artery and jugular vein. In addition, there are risks associated with any surgical procedure, such as infection, bleeding and an ''allergic'' reaction to the anesthesia.' "
What are the benefits of VNS for epilepsy? Is it a cure?,"'VNS is not a cure, and the total elimination of seizures is rare. However, many people who undergo VNS experience a significant (more than 50%) reduction in the frequency of seizures, as well as a decrease in seizure severity. This can greatly improve the quality of life for people with epilepsy.' "

The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves, the paired nerves that attach to the undersurface of the brain and relay information to and from the brain. Cranial nerve fibers conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the brain and various body structures, mostly in the head and neck. The vagus nerve - the longest of the cranial nerves - also extends to organs in the chest and abdomen. (The word vagus comes from a Latin word for ""wandering.\')' "
What are the side effects of VNS?,"'The most common side effects of VNS include:''Usually, these occur only when the nerve is being stimulated, and are generally mild and tend to go away over time.' Hoarseness Coughing Tingling in the neck and Problems swallowing"
When is VNS used to treat epilepsy?," Brain cells communicate by sending electrical signals in an orderly pattern. In people with epilepsy, this pattern is sometimes disrupted due either to an injury or the person's genetic make-up, causing brain cells to emit signals in an uncontrolled fashion. This creates over-excitement, somewhat like an electrical overload in the brain, leading to seizures. Seizures can be produced by electrical impulses from throughout the brain, called generalized seizures, or from a small area of the brain, called partial seizures. Most people with epilepsy can control their seizures with medications called anti-convulsant or anti-seizure drugs. About 20% of people with epilepsy do not respond to anti-seizure medications. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be used. VNS may be a treatment option for people whose seizures are not controlled by anti-seizure medications and who are not considered good candidates for surgery; for example, if their seizures are produced throughout the brain (generalized)."
How does VNS work?,"'It is not known exactly how VNS works. It is known, however, that the vagus nerve is an important pathway to the brain. It is thought that by stimulating the vagus nerve, electrical energy is discharged upward into a wide area of the brain, disrupting the abnormal brain activity responsible for seizures. Another theory suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve causes the release of special brain chemicals that decrease seizure activity.' "
What happens during VNS? How is it performed?,"'While the patient is asleep (general anesthesia), the stimulator device (that is about the size of a silver dollar) is surgically placed under the skin in the upper part of the chest. A connecting wire is run under the skin from the stimulator to an electrode that is attached to the vagus nerve, which is accessible through a small incision (cut) in the neck.'""After it is implanted, the stimulator is programmed using a computer to generate pulses of electricity at regular intervals, depending on the patient's tolerance. For example, the device may be programmed to stimulate the nerve for 30 seconds every five minutes. The settings on the device are adjustable, and the electrical current is gradually increased as the patient's tolerance increases. Re-programming the stimulator can be done in the doctor's office. The patient also is given a hand-held magnet, which when brought near the stimulator, can generate an immediate current of electricity to stop a seizure in progress or reduce the severity of the seizure.""'VNS is an add-on therapy, which means it is used in addition to another type of treatment. Patients who undergo VNS continue to take their seizure medications. In some cases, however, it may be possible to reduce the dosage of medication.' "
What are the risks of VNS?,"'The risks of VNS include injury to the vagus nerve or nearby blood vessels, including the carotid artery and jugular vein. In addition, there are risks associated with any surgical procedure, such as infection, bleeding and an ''allergic'' reaction to the anesthesia.' "
What are the benefits of VNS for epilepsy? Is it a cure?,"'VNS is not a cure, and the total elimination of seizures is rare. However, many people who undergo VNS experience a significant (more than 50%) reduction in the frequency of seizures, as well as a decrease in seizure severity. This can greatly improve the quality of life for people with epilepsy.' "
What is valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) is a disease caused by fungi (''Coccidioides immitis'' and ''C. posadasii'' species) that in about 50%-75% of normal (not immunocompromised) people causes either no symptoms or mild symptoms and those infected never seek medical care. When symptoms of this fungal infection are more pronounced, they usually present as lung problems (''cough'', shortness of breath, sputum production, fever, and chest pains). The disease can progress to chronic or progressive lung disease and may even become disseminated to the skin, lining tissue of the brain (meninges), skeleton, and other body areas. The disease can also infect many animal types (for example, ''dogs'', cattle, otters, and monkeys). From 1998 to 2011, the U.S. incidence has increased about tenfold to about 22,000 diagnosed individuals per year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) although some researchers estimate the number as many as 15,000 per year.''Most microbiologists and infectious disease physicians prefer the name ''coccidioidomycosis'' because the word describes the disease as a specific fungal disease, and this term may replace ''valley fever'' in the future. This disease has several commonly used names (valley fever, San Joaquin Valley fever, California valley fever, acute valley fever, and desert fever). Other names get confused with valley fever (for example, rift or African valley fever).''People first noticed coccidioidomycosis in the 1890s in Argentina when tissue biopsies of people with the disease showed pathogens that resembled coccidia (protozoa). During 1896-1900, investigators learned that a fungus causes the disease, not protozoa, so the term ""mycosis"" was eventually added to ""coccidia."" The valley fever cases are often noted to occur in outbreaks, usually when soil is disturbed and dust arises, and when groups of people visit an endemic region (such as San Joaquin Valley or Bakersfield [in Kern County], Calif., and Tucson, Ariz., or parts of southern New Mexico or west Texas) during late summer and early fall. The disease does not spread from person to person; it is acquired from the environment via contaminated soil and dust. About 150,000 individuals are estimated to become infected each year in the U.S. This may increase, since in Arizona, the number of infected individuals as of March 2018 was 2,461 -- far more than the 1,360 during the same time in 2017.'  "
What causes valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'Two species of fungi, ''Coccidioides immitis'' and ''Coccidioides posadasii'', cause coccidioidomycosis. Both are dimorphic (having mycelial and spore phases when viewed microscopically) and almost always are acquired through the respiratory tract by ''inhalation''. When viewed microscopically, the mycelial form found in the soil has arthroconidia (barrel-shaped asexual spores) attached to non-spore-forming rectangular mycelium cells, usually alternating in a line. Once someone inhales the arthroconidia, the fungus develops into 30-60 micron diameter structures called spherules that are filled with 3-5 micron diameter endospores. The large spherules then release the endospores that continue the infection; microscopic identification of these endospores in pus or tissue confirms the diagnosis.' "
Is valley fever (coccidioidomycosis) contagious?,"'Valley fever is not ''contagious'' person to person. People only become infected when they inhale arthroconidia (spores) of ''Coccidioides'' that settle in the ''lungs''. Spores are easily dispersed and become airborne mixed with dust, especially on dusty, windy days and in areas where soil has been recently disturbed by construction or similar actions.' "
What are the risk factors for developing valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'People living in the endemic areas (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) have been estimated to have a 1 in 33 chance of acquiring the disease every year (others have even higher risk, see below for Kern County, Calif.), so the chance increases (accumulates) the longer they reside in the area. However, even people simply passing through the area can get the disease. Males and pregnant females have a higher risk of getting the disease. People who do construction or farm work, especially the type that disturbs the soil, and any immunosuppressed person has an increased risk of developing valley fever (coccidioidomycosis). Poor air quality in the endemic areas also increases risk for the disease. Inmates (58 individuals) in California are suing the state (California Department of Corrections) because they allege they contracted the disease while serving prison time near the city of Avenal, Calif.''People at risk of getting the disease and its complications often have weakened immune systems.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'About 60% of all infected people (without immunosuppression) have no symptoms and do not seek medical care. About 30%-35% of people who develop symptoms have ''flu-like symptoms'' (fever, cough, malaise, and ''chills'') that resolve over about two to six weeks without treatment. Some may develop additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, ''night sweats'', ''headaches'', sputum production, and joint and muscle pains (symptoms resembling ''pneumonia''). Women, more often than men, may develop ''erythema nodosum'' (reddish, painful, tender lumps, usually on the legs) or ''erythema multiforme'' (an ''allergic reaction'' similar to ''erythema nodosum'' in multiple body sites with ''rash''). ""Desert rheumatism."" refers to the combination of fever, erythema nodosum, and migratory ''joint pains''. Usually these symptoms resolve in about two to six weeks.''Chronic coccidioidomycosis occurs in about 8% of patients and may spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. People develop lung ''cavities'' that may disappear in about two years or become calcified.''Progressive pulmonary coccidioidomycosis includes the above symptoms but progresses to lung volume loss, fibrosis (scarring), and inflammation, considered serious complications of the disease.''Disseminated coccidioidomycosis (about 1% of cases) can be characterized by the above symptoms, but they may occur over weeks to years and can be life threatening. The fungi live in any organ system but are most frequently seen in the skin, meninges, spinal cord, and bones. In a few individuals, the disease is rapidly fatal. Disseminated disease occurs most often in immunosuppressed individuals, males, and pregnant females.''Other mammals, like dogs, can become infected. As many as 28% of dogs by the age of 2 years may have had the disease, with about 6% showing symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, ''decreased appetite'', and listlessness. The animals are not contagious to each other or humans, but like in some humans, the disease may progress.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"""Early in the disease, the diagnosis is difficult because the symptoms may be mild that doctors don't initiate any tests. Accurate diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is important because there are many diseases that have similar initial symptoms and may occur in areas of the world where coccidioidomycosis occurs; for example, Andes virus (caused by a ""'hantavirus''), arbovirus ''encephalitis'' (caused by six different ''viruses''), Argentine hemorrhagic fever (an arenavirus infection caused by Junin virus), ''cryptococcosis'' (caused by ''Cryptococcus'' neoformans'', a fungal species), and others. Fortunately, a confirmative diagnostic test is easily done by microscopic examination of sputum or a tissue biopsy. The biopsy shows characteristic fungal spherules and endospores of ''Coccidioides immitis'' or ''Coccidioides posadasii''. These fungi can also be identified after they are cultured on fungal media (growth takes about five days). Additionally, there are several serum tests and a ''PCR'' test (to detect the genetic material of the fungus) that are available. High blood levels of IgG (an immunoglobulin) that react with the fungi can help determine the extent of the disease. Skin tests can determine if the person has been exposed to the fungi, but the test is not very specific or sensitive.''Other tests help determine the extent of the disease. The most frequent test is a ''chest X-ray'' to identify abnormalities in the lungs. Physicians may order ''MRI'' and ''CT scans'"" to examine a patient's brain or other organs (especially bone) to see if they're involved. Bone scans also help to determine the presence of bone involvement. Most physicians will do other routine blood tests such as a ""'CBC'' (''complete blood count'') and ESR (erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', a marker of inflammation) test.''Occasionally, the diagnosis may require obtaining samples of tissue or tissue fluid, so ''lumbar puncture'', ''bronchoscopy'', and surgical or needle biopsy may be done.' "
What is the treatment for valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'The majority of cases (over 60%) spontaneously resolves and requires no treatment. However, there are several anti-fungal ''drugs'' available to treat coccidioidomycosis if needed. The drug of choice is usually amphotericin B, but oral azoles (''fluconazole'' [''Diflucan''], ''itraconazole'' [''Sporanox''], and ''ketoconazole'' [''Nizoral'']). Newer antifungal agents including posaconazole and ''voriconazole'' are often used ""off label,"" meaning they have not been approved to treat coccidioidomycosis. Most of these drugs have side effects, and most have not been proven safe to use in pregnant patients except for amphotericin B. High relapse rates can occur with some patients (about 75% relapse with brain involvement), requiring lifelong antifungal therapy. In general, dosage (especially pediatric), length of time of drug administration, and the choice of drug is best decided in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.''Sometimes a patient may need surgical treatment. Pulmonary ''cavities'', persistent pulmonary infection, empyema (pus collection), and shunt placement are some of the surgical interventions used to treat this disease.''Other treatments (for example, ''prednisone'' [''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''] or alternative therapy such as dietary modification) are not currently recommended by most physicians; people should consult with their physician before trying to use such methods.'  "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'The majority of people who get infected with the'' Coccidioides'' fungi have a good prognosis, as the infection is usually self-limiting. Some people with self-limiting disease may get a few small calcified areas in the lung, but these typically cause no problems for the person. Chronic disease may produce more nodules and cavities in the lung and take a year or two to resolve, but usually the prognosis is good for many patients.''However, people with ''diabetes'' or the elderly have a only fair prognosis, as they can develop progressive pulmonary disease with symptoms (shortness of breath, lung fibrosis, and cavities in the lungs) that persist for years. Progressive coccidioidomycosis has a poor prognosis. About 1% of patients are at high risk (usually those who are immunosuppressed due to ''HIV'', ''cancer'', or ''chemotherapy'') for developing disseminated coccidioidomycosis, and these patients have a grave prognosis. Patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis can have rapid development of all the symptoms listed above and die if the disease is not appropriately and rapidly treated.' "
Is it possible to prevent valley fever (coccidioidomycosis)?,"'Research is progressing at several laboratories, but to date there is no vaccine available to prevent coccidioidomycosis in humans. People who live in endemic areas (see map in the last Web citation) of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas are likely to be exposed to the organisms since they occur in soil and dust. People who are more susceptible to the disease (for example, immunosuppressed people such as those with ''HIV/AIDS'' or ''cancer'', the elderly, and pregnant females) should avoid new construction sites and stay indoors on dusty days. Moistening the soil in these areas can prevent dust formation, and some investigators suggest that susceptible people should wear dust masks if dust exposure is likely. People who get the disease usually develop immunity to it, and unless they have compromised immune systems, will not get the disease again.' "
Where can one find more information on valley fever?,"'In California, Kern County developed a web site in 2013 devoted to valley fever because it is endemic. People who live there have about a 1%-3% chance per year of becoming infected.' "

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)?,"'Enterococci are a group of gram-positive, round-shaped bacteria that commonly live in the gut, although they can cause infection anywhere in the body. They are resistant to several antibiotics, but in the past, physicians could rely on the drug vancomycin to effectively treat enterococcal infections. In recent decades, however, some enterococci have become resistant to vancomycin. The two main species that cause problems are vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus faecium'' and vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus faecalis''. ''E. faecium'' is the most common species of VRE. These bacteria are not the same genus as other common fecal bacteria such as ''E. coli''.''Vancomycin resistance is acquired when a sensitive ''Enterococcus'' acquires a special piece of DNA called a plasmid that permits the bacteria to become resistant to vancomycin. The new ''strains'' are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). One concern is that VRE strains appear able to transfer vancomycin resistance to unrelated bacteria such as ''MRSA'' (''methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus'') and these strains are renamed VRSA. In addition, VRE organisms, like ''MRSA'', are usually resistant to more than one antibiotic.''VRE can be spread from person to person and are an increasing problem in hospitals and chronic care facilities. Approximately 30% of all enterococcal infections are now caused by vancomycin-resistant strains (VRE).' "
What causes a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE can exist in the body without causing infection, in which case a patient is said to be colonized with VRE. Colonization usually occurs in the bowel. If the number of VRE bacteria increases, they can invade the bloodstream or spread locally to cause an abdominal ''abscess'' or ''urinary tract infection''. Once in the bloodstream, VRE can cause meningitis, ''pneumonia'', or infection of a heart valve (endocarditis). VRE may also be introduced directly into an open sore or wound, causing a wound infection. The bacteria produce several substances, including proteases that help them break down the normal barriers between the gut tissue and the bloodstream. The vancomycin resistance in the bacteria are caused by a plasmid, a fragment of genetic material that allows the bacteria to be resistant to vancomycin.'  "
Are VRE contagious?,"'VRE are ''contagious'' from person to person. However, if a patient takes antibiotics, VRE organisms may develop in the individual (usually in the gastrointestinal tract or on other mucous membranes) and then invade the bloodstream or other areas. These individuals can then be contagious to other people.' "
How are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) spread?,"'VRE can be transmitted from person to person, especially in a hospital or chronic care facility. Microscopic amounts of fecal material from an infected or colonized patient can contaminate the hospital environment and be spread on the hands of health care personnel or by contamination of surfaces such as bedding or clothing. Patients who have VRE may inadvertently contaminate their beds and bathrooms. If the environment is not adequately cleaned, the next patient (or visitor) in the room may be at risk. VRE infections are not spread by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''.' "
What are risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections?,"'The healthy bowel harbors more than 400 different species of bacteria which compete with each other and help keep any one organism from overgrowing. However, if a patient takes antibiotics, some bacterial species are killed off and the balance among the bacteria is disrupted. In this case, a single species like VRE may increase to the point at which it can invade the bloodstream or cause a local infection. Thus, prior use of antibiotics, especially vancomycin, is a risk factor for infection with VRE. Other risk factors include having a compromised immune system, ''cancer'', a chronic disease like ''diabetes'', or ''kidney failure''. Infection is also more likely if there is a small break in the mucosal membrane (lining) of the bowel or in patients undergoing a gastrointestinal surgery or procedure. Indwelling devices, such as urinary catheters or intravenous lines, increase the risk of infection because they disrupt the normal mucosal or skin barriers and provide a type of artificial reef on which the organisms can grow. If a person is colonized or is hospitalized, their risk for infection with VRE increases.' "
What is the incubation period and contagious period for VRE?,"'The incubation period for VRE is not well documented, especially in those patients who develop VRE from taking antibiotics and because some individuals may be carriers of VRE and become infected after some problem that decreases their immune responses or damages their ''mucus'' membranes. Estimates of the incubation period vary from days to weeks or even longer, and the contagious period is estimated to be as long as VRE are shed from the patient.' "
"What are the signs and symptoms of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) 
infection?","'The symptoms of VRE infection vary according to the site of infection. If VRE has invaded the bloodstream, the patient will have ''fever'', a fast heart rate, and feel very sick. This syndrome is called ''sepsis''. In severe cases, the ''blood pressure'' may fall, causing ''shock'', although this is less common with VRE than with some other bacteria. Patients with urinary infections (''UTI'') may experience burning or ''pain'' with urination, ''back pain'', ''difficulty urinating'', ''frequent urination'', or ''fever''. Meningitis is uncommon and causes ''headache'', ''stiff neck'', ''confusion'', and/or fever. Infection of a heart valve (endocarditis) causes prolonged sepsis and may cause the valve to leak or fail. Endocarditis is more common if the patient already has a damaged heart valve or an artificial valve. Infected wounds are inflamed, with red and warm skin, soreness, swelling, and contain pus or have ''pus drainage''. ''Pneumonia'' causes fever, difficulty ''breathing'', and ''cough''.'  "
What types of doctors treat VRE infections?,"'Although some VRE infections may be treated by pediatricians and/or primary care physicians, more serious infections may be diagnosed and treated in consultation with emergency-medicine specialists, infectious-disease specialists, internal-medicine specialists, critical care specialists, and in some cases, surgeons. Ancillary personnel who may help manage VRE-infected patients may include hospital infection-control workers and pharmacists.' "
How do physicians diagnose vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections?,"'Diagnosis requires culturing the organism. VRE is easily grown on culture plates in a laboratory. Definitive diagnosis requires that the organisms show resistance to vancomycin; usually sensitivities to additional antibiotics are determined at the same time. To get material to culture, a sample of the infected tissue is taken. For a wound infection, a swab is usually rubbed over the surface to get infected material. Blood is drawn and cultured to detect sepsis or endocarditis. Urine or sputum samples are taken to identify ''urinary tract infections'' or pneumonia. If VRE is cultured from blood or spinal fluid, it almost invariably indicates infection. However, if VRE is cultured from sputum, urine, or a wound, it could indicate either colonization or infection. The physician will ask the patient questions and perform a physical exam to help determine if any signs or symptoms of infection of these areas are present. Imaging studies such as ''X-rays'' or ''CT scans'' may be used to detect pneumonia or abscesses.' "
What is the treatment for a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE are resistant to a wide array of antibiotics. Fortunately, newer antibiotics have been developed to ''bridge'' this gap, but sometimes they must be used in combination with other antibiotics. Most microbiological laboratories will supply the physician treating the patient with a list of antibiotics the VRE are resistant and susceptible to. If the laboratory does not or cannot provide an alternative antibiotic for VRE treatment, the state lab or the CDC should be notified as they may be able to provide additional help and suggestions for treatment.''Linezolid'', daptomycin, ''tigecycline'', oritavancin, telavancin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and teicoplanin (not available in the U.S.) are antimicrobials that have been used with success against various VRE strains. Clinicians have also had some success in treating VRE with various combinations of antibiotics. However, VRE antibiotic susceptibility tests done for each infection should help guide the selection of treatment protocols. In addition, consultation with an infectious-disease expert is usually done.''Other procedures can augment the antimicrobial treatment of VRE-infected patients. If there is a collection of pus, such as an abscess, it is important that it be drained. If the infection is associated with an intravenous line, the line should be removed if at all possible. Similarly, it is desirable to remove urinary catheters to facilitate treatment of the ''urinary tract infection''. Patients who are colonized but not infected do not require treatment. There is no established way to eradicate colonization of the ''stool'' once it occurs.''People infected with VRE need to be treated by medical caregivers; there is no home remedy for VRE infections.'  "
What is the prognosis of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE infections can be cured in most patients, and the outcome is often more dependent on the underlying disease than on the infecting organism. The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection. For example, heart-valve infections may require six weeks of antibiotic therapy. Although the heart valve or other infected site infection is cured of VRE infection, many patients may be still colonized with the organism on mucosal surfaces.' "
What are the complications of VRE infections?,"'The complications most often seen with VRE infections are sepsis, endocarditis, ''urinary tract infections'', meningitis, and severe wound infections. Early appropriate antibiotic treatment can reduce the severity of these complications; if any complications develop, an infectious-disease consultant is recommended.' "
Is it possible to prevent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections?,"'The best way to prevent infection is to prevent transmission. This means that hospitals and care facilities must pay meticulous attention to infection-control guidelines to reduce the spread of VRE from patient to patient. Individuals can reduce their risk by washing hands after using the bathroom and before and after touching the mouth or nose. Minimizing the use of intravenous catheters, especially central lines, reduces the risk of VRE sepsis. Similarly, the use of urinary catheters should be minimized and catheters should be removed promptly when no longer needed. Finally, antibiotics should be used only for appropriate indications. Antibiotics are ineffective against ''viruses'' and the ''common cold''. There is no ''vaccine'' available against VRE.' "
What precautions should people take when tending to someone with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'Caretakers of infected patients should follow good hand hygiene principles. This means washing hands or using ''alcohol'"" disinfectants on hands before and after touching the patient or objects in the patient's environment. If there is visible soiling of the hands, soap and water should be used rather than alcohol-based disinfectants. If the patient is ""'incontinent'' of ''stool'' or urine, gloves should be used to clean the bed or the patient. However, gloves are not a substitute for good hand hygiene. Simple household disinfectants are effective against VRE and can be used to clean the environment. A 10% bleach solution may also be used.''Hospitals will take additional precautions. Once a patient is known to harbor VRE, whether colonized or infected, the patient will be placed in ""contact precautions,"" usually in a private room. People entering the room will wear a cloth or paper gown over their clothes and use gloves. Again, hand hygiene is critical to reduce spread of the organism. Masks are not needed because VRE is not spread through the air but by direct contact.'  "
What research is being done on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)?,"'Research on VRE is focused on several areas:' Improving infection-control practices to reduce spread of VRE in health care environments The development of new antibiotics to treat VRE (for example, dalbavancin [Dalvance], tedizolid [Sivextro]) The development of urinary catheters and intravenous catheters that are more resistant to infection Basic research aimed at improving our understanding of the bacteria itself and how vancomycin resistance is transferred from species to species"

Background,"'Variant CJD (vCJD) is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans. Although experience with this new disease is limited, evidence to date indicates that there has never been a case of vCJD transmitted through direct contact of one person with another. However, a case of probable transmission of vCJD through transfusion of blood components from an asymptomatic donor who subsequently developed the disease has been reported.''Since variant CJD was first reported in 1996, a total of 229 patients with this disease from 12 countries have been identified. As of June 2, 2014, variant CJD cases have been reported from the following countries: 177 from the United Kingdom, 27 from France, 5 from Spain, 4 from Ireland, 4 from the United States, 3 in the Netherlands, 2 in Portugal, 2 in Italy, 2 in Canada and one each from Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan. Two of the four U.S. cases, two of the four cases from Ireland, one of the two cases from Canada, and the single case from Japan were likely exposed to the BSE agent while residing in the United Kingdom.''There has never been a case of vCJD that did not have a history of exposure within a country where the cattle disease, BSE, was occurring.''It is believed that the persons who have developed vCJD became infected through their consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of BSE or in three cases, each reported from the United Kingdom, through receipt of blood from an asymptomatic, infected donor. There is no known treatment of vCJD and it is invariably fatal.' "
vCJD Differs from Classic CJD,"'This variant form of CJD should not be confused with the classic form of CJD that is endemic throughout the world, including the United States. There are several important differences between these two forms of the disease. The median age at death of patients with classic CJD in the United States, for example, is 68 years, and very few cases occur in persons under 30 years of age. In contrast, the median age at death of patients with vCJD in the United Kingdom is 28 years.''vCJD can be confirmed only through examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy or at ''autopsy'', but a ""probable case"" of vCJD can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria developed in the United Kingdom.''The incubation period for vCJD is unknown because it is a new disease. However, it is likely that ultimately this incubation period will be measured in terms of many years or decades. In other words, whenever a person develops vCJD from consuming a BSE-contaminated product, he or she likely would have consumed that product many years or a decade or more earlier.''In contrast to classic CJD, vCJD in the United Kingdom predominantly affects younger people, has atypical clinical features, with prominent psychiatric or sensory symptoms at the time of clinical presentation and delayed onset of neurologic abnormalities, including ''ataxia'' within weeks or months, ''dementia'' and myoclonus late in the illness, a duration of illness of at least 6 months, and a diffusely abnormal non-diagnostic ''electroencephalogram''.''The BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom reached its peak incidence in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. The outbreak may have resulted from the feeding of scrapie-containing sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was amplified by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.' "
U.S. Surveillance for variant CJD,"'The possibility that BSE can spread to humans has focused increased attention on the desirability of enhancing national surveillance for ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' (CJD) in the United States in order to detect variant CJD. Improving methods to detect classic CJD, such as increasing the number of autopsies on patients with suspected prion disease, enhances the ability to identify cases of variant CJD.''The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) monitors the trends and current incidence of classic CJD in the United States through several surveillance mechanisms. The oldest and most systematic method includes analyzing death certificate information from U.S. multiple cause-of-death data, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. During 1979-2003 the average annual age adjusted death rates of classic CJD have remained relatively stable. Moreover, deaths from non-iatrogenic CJD in persons aged <30 years in the United States remain extremely rare (<5 cases per 1 billion per year). In contrast, in the United Kingdom, over half of the patients who died with vCJD were in this young age group.''In addition, CDC collects, reviews and when indicated, actively investigates reports by health care personnel or institutions of possible iatrogenic CJD and variant CJD cases. Finally and very importantly, in 1996-97, CDC established, in collaboration with the American Association of Neuropathologists, the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University, which performs special diagnostic tests for prion diseases, including post-mortem tests that can detect vCJD.' "
vCJD Cases Reported in the US,"'Four cases of vCJD have been reported from the United States. By convention, variant CJD cases are ascribed to the country of initial symptom onset, regardless of where the exposure occurred. There is strong evidence that suggests that two of the four cases were exposed to the BSE agent in the United Kingdom and that the third was exposed while living in Saudi Arabia. The history of the fourth patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States.'""The first patient was born in the United Kingdom in the late 1970's and lived there until a move to Florida in 1992. The patient had onset of symptoms in November 2001 and died in June of 2004. The patient never donated or received blood, plasma, or organs, never received human growth hormone, nor did the patient ever have major surgery other than having ""'wisdom teeth'' extracted in 2001. Additionally, there was no family history of CJD.'""The second patient resided in Texas during 2001-2005. Symptoms began in early 2005 while the patient was in Texas. He then returned to the United Kingdom, where his illness progressed, and a diagnosis of variant CJD was made. The diagnosis was confirmed neuropathologically at the time of the patient's death. While living in the United States, the patient had no history of hospitalization, of having invasive medical procedures, or of donation or receipt of blood and blood products. The patient almost certainly acquired the disease in the United Kingdom. He was born in the United Kingdom and lived there throughout the defined period of risk (1980-1996) for human exposure to the agent of bovine spongiform ""'encephalopathy'' (BSE, commonly known as ""mad cow"" disease). His stay in the United States was too brief relative to what is known about the incubation period for variant CJD.'""The third patient was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and has lived in the United States since late 2005. The patient occasionally stayed in the United States for up to 3 months at a time since 2001 and there was a shorter visit in 1989. The patient's onset of symptoms occurred in Spring 2006. In late November 2006, the Clinical Prion Research Team at the University of California San Francisco Memory and ""'Aging'"" Center confirmed the vCJD clinical diagnosis by pathologic study of adenoid and brain biopsy tissues. The patient has no history of receipt of blood, a past neurosurgical procedure, or residing in or visiting countries of Europe. Based on the patient's history, the occurrence of a previously reported Saudi case of vCJD attributed to likely consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle products in Saudi Arabia, and the expected greater than 7 year incubation period for food-related vCJD, this U.S. case-patient was most likely infected from contaminated cattle products consumed as a child when living in Saudi Arabia. The patient has no history of donating blood and the public health investigation has identified no known risk of transmission to U.S. residents from this patient.""""The fourth patient died in Texas in May 2014. Laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of variant CJD. The confirmation was made when laboratory results from an autopsy of the patient's brain tested positive for variant CJD."" "
Prevention Measures against BSE Spread,"'To prevent BSE from entering the United States, severe restrictions were placed on the importation of live ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, and certain ruminant products from countries where BSE was known to exist. These restrictions were later extended to include importation of ruminants and certain ruminant products from all European countries.''Because the use of ruminant tissue in ruminant feed was probably a necessary factor responsible for the BSE outbreak in the United Kingdom and because of the current evidence for possible transmission of BSE to humans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration instituted a ruminant feed ban in June 1997 that became fully effective as of October 1997. As of October 26, 2009, a regulation issued by FDA in April 2009 came into effect establishing an enhanced BSE-related feed ban in the U.S. This enhanced feed ban will further harmonize BSE feed control measures in the U.S. with those in Canada (see below). In addition, FDA continues to enforce its important 1997 mammalian-to-ruminant feed ban through its BSE inspection and BSE feed testing programs.''As of July 12, 2007, an enhanced BSE-related feed ban came into effect in Canada. CFIA established this ban to more effectively prevent and quickly eliminate BSE from Canada. The enhanced ban prohibits most proteins, including potentially BSE infectious tissues known as ""specified risk materials"" (SRM) from all animal feeds, pet foods, and fertilizers, not just from cattle feed as required by the ban instituted in 1997. The 1997 feed ban in Canada was similar to the feed ban instituted in the United States that same year. As recently reported by CFIA, removing SRM from the entire animal feed system addresses risks associated with the potential contamination of cattle feed during production, distribution, storage, and use. Applying the same measure to pet food and fertilizer materials addresses the possible exposure of cattle and other susceptible animals to these products. With this ban in place, CFIA expects BSE should be eliminated from the Canadian cattle herd by about the year 2017.''In late 2001, the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment study of various scenarios involving BSE in the U.S. concluded that the FDA ruminant feed rule provides a major defense against this disease.' "
What is chickenpox? What causes chickenpox?,"'Chickenpox is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is in the herpesvirus family. These ''viruses'' infect many tissues during primary infection and then become dormant; they can reactivate later to cause disease. In the case of VZV, reactivation disease is called ''shingles'' or ''herpes zoster'' and typically occurs when there is a weakened immune system. Before chickenpox ''vaccine'' became routine in the U.S., chickenpox was a common childhood disease. Today, it still occurs in populations that are not routinely vaccinated. Varicella-zoster virus is often categorized with the other common so-called ""viral exanthems"" (viral ''rashes'') such as ''measles'' (''rubeola''), ''German measles'' (''rubella''), ''fifth disease'' (parvovirus B19), ''mumps'' virus, and ''roseola'' (human herpesvirus 6), but these viruses are unrelated except for their tendency to cause ''rashes''. In unimmunized populations, most people contract chickenpox by age 15, the majority between ages 5 and 9, but all ages can contract it. Chickenpox is usually more severe in adults and very young infants than children. Winter and spring are the most common times of the year for chickenpox to occur.' "
What are risk factors for chickenpox?,'The risk factors for chickenpox are' not having immunity against chickenpox by infection or vaccination and exposure to a person with chickenpox or shingles.
How does chickenpox spread? What is the incubation period and contagious period for chickenpox?,"'Chickenpox is very highly contagious. It is easily passed between non-immune family members and school classmates through airborne particles, droplets in exhaled air, and fluid from the blisters or sores. It also can be transmitted indirectly by direct contact with articles of clothing and other items exposed to fresh fluid from open sores.''The infected person is contagious up to five days (most often, one to two days) before and five days after the ''rash'' appears. It is important for the infected person to stay home away from others while blisters and moist sores are present. When all of the sores have crusted over and are dry, which usually takes about a week, the person is considered no longer contagious.''Because it is so contagious, a non-immune (not vaccinated) person who is exposed to chickenpox is advised to stay home and away from infants and small children or other non-immune people for 21 days after exposure. This is the incubation period before illness occurs. If the person does not become ill in 21 days, he/she may return to usual activities around others. This is very disruptive to school or work. It is not necessary for people who have been vaccinated.''Screening and vaccination for chickenpox is strongly recommended for those who will be working in the health care professions.''When a person with chickenpox must be hospitalized, he/she will be placed in a specially equipped room that vents air harmlessly to the outside environment (negative pressure room). Health care workers will wear gowns and gloves whenever in contact with the patient. These precautions are necessary to prevent non-immune staff and other patients from becoming infected by contact or by airborne virus escaping into the hallway or air handling system.''Varicella virus remains dormant or latent after the acute chickenpox syndrome. It may sometimes be recurrent as a limited area of blisters that look like chickenpox; this syndrome is called ''shingles'' or ''herpes'' zoster. Shingles is much less contagious than chickenpox. It is not transmitted by airborne virus but rather by direct contact with blisters.''Chickenpox is more complicated at older ages but is usually mild in childhood. It also provides lifelong immunity. Parents have sometimes brought well children to the home of a child with chickenpox for a ""chickenpox party"" as a way for them to acquire lifelong protection early. This practice may make sense in very resource-poor areas of the world, but it carries the risk of complications of varicella and the long-term risk of shingles later on (which is very painful and has other potential serious complications). Where safe and effective varicella vaccine (chickenpox vaccine) is available it does not make sense to promote immunity this way.' "
What are chickenpox symptoms and signs? How long does chickenpox last?,"'The incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms) is about 14 to 21 days after contact with the virus. Chickenpox is characterized by general ''weakness'', ''fever'' up to 102 F, and red spots that start on the same day or so as the fever. The spots rapidly develop into ''blister''-like skin lesions with surrounding redness. Rash usually starts on the head or trunk (the area where most of the rash appears) and spreads to the arms and legs. The blisters may spread to mucous membranes and produce ulcers inside the eyelids, mouth, throat, and genital area. Any area of skin that is irritated (by ''diaper rash'', ''poison ivy'', ''eczema'', ''sunburn'', etc.) is likely to be hard hit by the rash. The rash is typically very ''itchy'' (pruritic) and develops in groups of new blisters even as older blisters begin to dry up. Over five to seven days, all of the blisters dry up and become crusted, and the illness is over.''The ''chickenpox rash'' is very typical, and diagnosis is usually made based on symptoms and appearance of the rash without having to do any tests. However, people with immune system problems may have an atypical case. In situations where the rash is unclear, fluid or tissue biopsy from a blister or sore can be tested for VZV DNA by ''PCR''.'  "
What does chickenpox look like?,"'The rash of chickenpox develops in groups with raised red spots arriving first, progressing to blisters filled with clear fluid, like a drop of water on red skin. The blisters may be dimpled in the center. They may break and reform, then finally form sores before drying up as scabs or crusts. They have been described best as grouped blisters on a red base in varying stages of development; some areas may just be forming blisters, while another area may already be crusting over. The crusts will come off on their own, usually without permanent scarring. ''Scars'' may occur if sores are scratched or deep, or if bacterial infection occurs, so scratching should be minimized.' "
What types of specialists treat chickenpox?,"'Primary care providers usually manage most cases of chickenpox. This includes pediatricians, internal medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, nurse practitioners, and sometimes ''emergency medicine'' doctors. Dermatologists or infectious disease specialists may become involved as consultants in complicated cases or cases at high risk for severe disease, such as ''pregnancy'', adults, ''eczema'', or immune deficiency.' "
What are treatment options for chickenpox?,"'Most of the treatments for chickenpox are aimed at decreasing the symptoms, such as severe ''itching''. A non-''aspirin'' analgesic like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') can be used to decrease the ''fevers'' and aches. Children should never be given ''acetylsalicylic acid'' (aspirin) or aspirin-containing ''cold'"" medications because of the risks for developing Reye's syndrome (a severe brain disease associated with ""'liver'' and brain dysfunction and death).''Frequent oatmeal baths (plain oatmeal in water, Aveeno, etc.) can decrease the ''itching'' associated with chickenpox. In addition, soothing lotions and moisturizers such as ''calamine lotion'' or any other similar ''over-the-counter'' preparation can be applied to the rash. ''Diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') or other ''antihistamines'' can be helpful in controlling the itching. Always discuss these treatment options with your health care practitioner.''In addition to medications, there are also preventive measures that are needed. For young children, it is important to keep nails trimmed in order to minimize injury due to scratching and to control the risks for secondary ''bacterial infections'' like ''impetigo'' or ''Staphylococcus'' (''staph infection'').''Lastly, in severe cases or people at high risk for severe disease, ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') can be prescribed. Acyclovir is an antiviral drug that has been used to shorten the duration of the infection. This medication has only been shown to be effective if started within one to two days of onset of the chickenpox rash. Most commonly, this treatment is reserved for patients with other diagnoses that put them at risk for severe disease (adults, ''pregnant'' women, severe skin diseases, immunodeficiency).' "
Are there home remedies for chickenpox?,"'Chickenpox is usually treated at home with over-the-counter medications for fever, antihistamines for itching, soothing oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.' "
What are the possible complications of chickenpox?,"'Complications can and do occur from chickenpox and may fatal. Infection of the open pox sore by bacteria can injure the skin, sometimes causing scarring, especially if the patient scratches the inflamed area. Bacterial ''skin infection'' with group A ''Streptococcus'' (""''strep''"" or ""''impetigo''"") is, in fact, the most common complication of chickenpox in children. Other complications are much less common. In children, the central nervous system may be affected. A disorder of the cerebellar portion of the brain (""cerebellitis"" or ""cerebellar ''ataxia''"") may occur with wobbliness, ''dizziness'', ''tremor'', and altered speech. ''Encephalitis'' (inflammation of the brain with ''headaches'', ''seizures'"", and decreased consciousness) may occur as well as damaged nerves (nerve palsies). Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal combination of liver and brain disease, may occur in children who take aspirin or salicylate products. (Children with fever should not take aspirin.) Other complications include bloodstream infection (""'sepsis'' or ""''blood poisoning''"" from skin infection) and ''dehydration''. Death from varicella may occur even in healthy children.''Pneumonia'' is the most common complication in ''teens'' through adults and can be life-threatening. Most adults who have died of varicella were infected by unvaccinated children.''After primary infection has resolved, usually later in life or during a period of weakened immunity, VZV may cause herpes zoster or shingles, which can have a number of complications. People with certain conditions are at higher risk of severe complications and death:''A pregnant woman who has never had chickenpox or the vaccine should avoid touching or being in the same room as a person with suspected chickenpox. Not only is she at risk for ''pneumonia'' caused by the chickenpox virus, the fetus is at risk for infection in the womb (congenital varicella syndrome) up until 20 weeks gestation. Congenital varicella causes multiple ''birth defects'', such as skin scarring and malformed limbs. It is fortunately very, very rare. ''Newborn'' infants whose mothers develop chickenpox five days before or two days after birth are at highest risk of severe chickenpox. These ''babies'' may develop symptoms within two weeks of birth. This is because there is not enough time for the mother to develop varicella antibody to pass on to the baby. The fatality rate for these babies is up to 30%. If the baby develops symptoms at 10-28 days of age, it is likely to be mild.'

What is shingles? What complications can shingles cause?,"'Latent VZV can reactivate from a cutaneous nerve to cause a chickenpox-like rash, but instead of being widespread, the rash is limited to the area of skin involving one or two nerve roots and may last up to four weeks. This is called herpes zoster or shingles, which may cause itching or even severe, burning ''pain''. This ''pain'' is called ''postherpetic neuralgia'' (PHN) and may last for weeks to months.''PHN occurs in about 10% of individuals over 40 or immunocompromised patients. This nerve problem may be disabling, and it does not respond to over-the-counter medications or even narcotics. It often must be treated with anti-''seizure'' medications to reduce pain. This medications can have their own important side effects and limit daily activities. In addition, shingles may be treated with antiviral and ''corticosteroid'' drugs, which may also have significant side effects.''Shingles can break out in any area of the body depending on which nerve roots are involved. It is impossible to predict where it will break out.''One important complication of shingles is ''blindness'' if the outbreak occurs in the nerves to the eye (''ocular'' nerves). Another complication occurs with involvement of the auditory nerves, called ''Ramsay Hunt syndrome''. This syndrome may cause severe ear pain, ''hearing loss'', severe ''dizziness'' or ''vertigo'', and ''nausea'' that is difficult to treat. This may last for several weeks and be disabling.''In some cases of severe immune deficiency, such as after chemotherapy, shingles may become widespread (disseminated). Essentially, it becomes widespread similar to primary chickenpox infection. Disseminated shingles is as contagious as chickenpox and can be transmitted by airborne droplets, as well as contact with blister fluid.''Shingles has been associated with inflammation of blood vessels (''vasculitis'') and may be associated with an increased risk of ''strokes'' in the months after the outbreak. VZV has been detected in blood vessels of people affected by ''giant cell arteritis'' (''temporal arteritis''), which is associated with sudden, permanent blindness and other problems.' "
Is shingles contagious?,"'Shingles is contagious to nonimmune people who have direct contact with fluid from the blisters or open sores. The only situation in which shingles can be transmitted by airborne droplets is when it is disseminated, like primary varicella or chickenpox.''In health care settings, people with shingles are placed on contact precautions, which means people must wear protective gowns and gloves whenever in contact with the patient.''Disseminated shingles requires the same airborne precautions as chickenpox, in addition to contact precautions. The patient must be placed in a room that is specially equipped to vent infectious air harmlessly to the outside. This is called negative pressure ventilation. It is used whenever there is a risk of airborne infectious particles escaping into the hospital hallway or air handling system.' "
"What can be done if a nonimmune person at high risk for complications is 
exposed to chickenpox?","'If this happens, the exposed individual should be offered varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG or VariZig). VZIG provides about two weeks of protective antibody, which is enough time for the antibodies to neutralize the virus and reduce infection.''Individuals who should receive post-exposure VZIG include nonimmune pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, newborns whose mothers had chickenpox five days before to two days after birth, and premature infants. VZIG is given as one dose as soon as possible after exposure to VZV and up to 10 days afterward, or at any time during hospitalization in the case of hospitalized premature infants.' "
Can a vaccine prevent chickenpox?,"'Yes, it is highly effective and recommended by the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Varicella vaccine has reduced the numbers of chickenpox cases and their complications by 90%. The current aim in the U.S. and many other countries is to achieve universal (or nearly universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine (varicella vaccine). The vaccination requires only two shots, may be combined with MMR (MMRV) in one vaccine, and is very safe and effective. The first vaccination is given at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second (booster) is given at 4 to 6 years of age. Catch-up vaccination in those who missed it in early childhood can be given at any time until adulthood, as long as a total of two doses have been given at least one to two months apart.''If an older person has not had chickenpox, the vaccine may be given at any time, although those over 50 should receive the ''shingles vaccine''. There have been very few vaccine side effects. All but those with a compromised immune system should have the vaccination.''Unfortunately, varicella vaccine is the most commonly refused childhood vaccine; parents may still view chickenpox as the least severe vaccine-preventable disease. Prior to varicella vaccine licensure in 1995, however, there were 4 million cases of chickenpox infection annually, resulting in more than 10,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths per year in the United States. Since licensure, universal immunization has reduced by 80% the annual morbidity, mortality, and hospitalizations from chickenpox.'  "
What is the difference between varicella vaccine and shingles vaccine?,"'The difference between these ''vaccines'' may be confusing, so they are conventionally referred to as chickenpox vaccine and shingles vaccine, to better distinguish them.''Varicella vaccine (also called chickenpox vaccine) is a live varicella virus strain that is formulated for nonimmune individuals. It does not cause widespread infection like wild-type varicella virus but only local infection, enough to stimulate new, protective levels of antibodies. It is typically given in children or adolescents, but adults may receive it. The current FDA-approved varicella vaccine is called ''Varivax''. It may also be formulated with ''measles'', mumps, and ''rubella'' (MMR) vaccine as MMRV, or ProQuad.''Childhood vaccination with Varivax or ProQuad is given at age 12-15 months of age and 4 to 6 years of age. Varicella vaccine sometimes causes local blisters within two weeks in the injection area. Because the dose of virus is higher in Varivax, there is a small risk of transmission to others, and contact with immune suppressed people and nonimmune pregnant women should be avoided until healed. As live ''vaccines'', ProQuad and Varivax should not be given to those with immune system problems.''Varicella vaccination is important for children, but it should also be considered for nonimmune adults who work with children, women who are planning pregnancy, health care professionals, ''travelers'', correctional institutions, and military personnel. Adults born before 1980, when chickenpox was common, are assumed to have antibodies to it. Adults born after 1980 or outside the U.S. can be screened for VZV antibodies before being offered vaccine. It is given as two doses at least four to eight weeks apart at ages 13 and over. Adults 50 years of age and over will usually receive the shingles vaccine instead.''Varicella-zoster vaccine (shingles vaccine) is formulated to boost varicella antibodies in older adults. The shingles ''vaccines'' are indicated for adults over 50 years of age; most adults currently in this age group have had chickenpox, whether they recall it or not. There are two brands of FDA-approved shingles vaccines: ''Zostavax'' and Shingrix. Zostavax is a live ''varicella virus vaccine'' that is FDA-approved to be given in one dose after age 50, however, there was no data on duration of protection, and the risk of complications from shingles is highest in those over 60 years of age. For this reason, the ACIP recommended administering Zostavax to those aged 60 and above; this decision was supported by later data showing a significant drop in protection 10 years after vaccination. Zostavax is a live vaccine, and some may develop blisters at the site of injection or very rarely disseminated lesions. Due to the theoretical risk of transmission, lesions should be covered, and contact with immunosuppressed or nonimmune pregnant individuals should be avoided until healed.''While boosters of Zostavax were being debated, the newer Shingrix vaccine was developed, and is now preferred. Shingrix is a non-live antigen (a VZV protein that stimulates antibodies) with an adjuvant (a molecule that activates the immune system). It is given as two doses at least eight weeks apart. Data has shown that protective levels of antibodies from Shingrix last much longer than that produced by Zostavax. As of January 2018, the ACIP has recommended Shingrix as the preferred vaccine for the ''prevention'' of shingles and its complications in older adults, starting at the FDA-approved age of 50.''An anticipated advantage of a non-live vaccine, Shingrix may have potential use in immunocompromised individuals who are at risk for more serious complications of shingles, such as dissemination. The ACIP awaits further evidence before recommending it as safe and effective in these individuals.' "
What is the prognosis of chickenpox?,"""The prognosis of uncomplicated chickenpox is generally good when acquired in childhood, and even in most adults, after the chickenpox rash goes away. Most people never experience chickenpox symptoms again after the first occurrence, and they are immune to other people's chickenpox. This is because the virus remains dormant in the nervous system; this also means that chickenpox can sometimes resurface later in life as shingles (zoster)."" "
What is the prognosis of shingles?,"'The prognosis of shingles is generally best in younger individuals, although it still causes significant discomfort. The prognosis is poorer the older the individual is when shingles occurs. This is why shingles vaccination is so important for people over the age of 50.' "
Introduction to Bleeding Varices,"'Varices are dilated blood vessels usually in the ''esophagus'' or stomach. They cause no symptoms unless they rupture and bleed.''Bleeding from varices is a life-threatening complication of ''portal hypertension''. Portal ''hypertension'' is an increase in the pressure within the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the digestive organs to the ''liver'') due to blockage of blood flow throughout the liver.''This increased pressure in the portal vein causes the development of large, swollen veins (varices) within the esophagus and stomach. The varices are fragile and can rupture easily, resulting in a large amount of blood loss.''The most common cause of portal ''hypertension'' is ''cirrhosis'' of the liver. ''Cirrhosis'' is scarring which accompanies the healing of liver injury caused by ''hepatitis'', ''alcohol'', or other less common causes of liver damage. In cirrhosis, the ''scar tissue'' blocks the flow of blood through the liver and slows its processing functions.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Bleeding Varices?,"'Symptoms of ''bleeding varices'' include:' Vomiting of blood Black, tarry, or bloody stool Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Shock (in severe cases)
"
How Are Bleeding Varices Treated?,"'Bleeding from varices is a medical emergency and treatment should be immediate. If the bleeding is not controlled quickly, a person may go into shock or die. In severe cases, a person may need to be placed temporarily on a ventilator to prevent the ''lungs'' from filling with blood. Aside from the urgent need to stop the bleeding, treatment is also aimed at preventing future bleeding. Procedures that help treat bleeding varices include:' Banding: A procedure performed by a gastroenterologist in which small rubber bands are placed directly over the varices. This will stop the bleeding and eradicate the varices. Sclerotherapy: A procedure in which a gastroenterologist directly injects the varices with a blood-clotting solution instead of banding them. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS): A radiological procedure in which a stent (a tubular device) is placed in the middle of the liver. The stent connects the hepatic vein with the portal vein. This procedure is done by placing a catheter through a vein in the neck. It is performed to relieve the high blood pressure that has built up in the liver.
     Distal Splenorenal Shunt (DSRS): A surgical procedure that connects the splenic vein to the left kidney vein in order to reduce pressure in the varices and control bleeding. Liver transplant: A liver transplant may be done in cases of end-stage liver disease. Devascularization: A surgical procedure that removes the bleeding varices. This procedure is done when a TIPS or a surgical shunt is not possible or unsuccessful in controlling the bleeding.
	"
Can Bleeding Varices Be Prevented?,"'Treating the underlying cause of bleeding varices can help prevent their recurrence and treating ''liver disease'' earlier on may prevent their development. Certain medications including the class of heart ''drugs'' called ""''beta-blockers''"" may reduce elevated portal pressure and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Long acting nitroglycerines are also used for this purpose.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What are veins and what is their function?,"'Veins are blood vessels that return blood from all the organs in the body toward the heart. When the different organs use oxygen from the blood to perform their functions, they release the used blood containing waste products (such as carbon dioxide) into the veins. Blood in the veins is then transported to the heart and returned to the lungs, where the waste carbon dioxide is released and more oxygen is loaded by the blood and taken back to the rest of the body by the arteries.''Veins also act as a storage for unused blood. When the body is at rest, only a portion of the available blood in the body circulates. The rest of the blood remains inactive in the veins and enters the active circulation when the body becomes more active and needs the additional blood to carry oxygen to the entire body. This storing capacity is due to the elasticity (flexibility to expand) of the walls of the veins.''Veins have different sizes that depends their location and function. The largest veins are in the center of the body; these collect the blood from all the other smaller veins and channel it into the heart. The branches of these large veins get smaller and smaller as they move away from the center of the body. The veins closer to the skin surface are called superficial veins. The veins that are deeper and closer to the center of the body are called deep veins. There are also other veins that connect the superficial veins to the deep veins, and these are called perforating veins.' "
What are varicose veins and spider veins?,"'Veins can bulge with pools of blood when they fail to circulate the blood properly. These visible and bulging veins, called varicose veins, are more common in the legs and thighs, but can develop anywhere in the body.''Large varicose veins'' can be visible, bulging, palpable (can be felt by touching), long, and dilated (greater than 4 millimeters in diameter). ''Small ""''spider veins''""'' also can appear on the skin\'s surface. These may look like short, fine lines, ""starburst"" clusters, or a web-like maze. They are typically not palpable. Spider veins are most common in the thighs, ankles, and ''feet''. They may also appear on the face. The medical term for spider veins is ''telangiectasias''.' "
Varicose vein and spider vein pictures,'''' 
Who gets varicose and spider veins?,"'Varicose and spider veins can occur in men or women of any age, but most frequently affect women in the childbearing years and older people. Varicose veins are very common. Some estimates suggest that about 10% to 15% of men and most older women who have varicose or spider veins.'""A family history of varicose veins and older age increase one's tendency to develop varicose and spider veins. ""'Other risk factors include:' a sedentary lifestyle,  weight gain,  prolonged standing, and  pregnancy."
What causes varicose and spider veins? ,"'The causes of varicose and spider veins are not entirely understood. In some instances, the absence or ''weakness'' of valves in the veins may cause poor venous circulation (blood flow in the veins) and lead to varicose veins. Valves inside veins normally act to ensure that blood in the veins does not flow in a backward direction (retrograde) away from the large (deep) veins and the heart. They are mainly located in perforating veins and some deep veins.''In other cases, weaknesses in the vein walls may cause pooling of the blood. The walls of the blood vessels can become weaker and less competent than normal, causing the volume of blood in the veins to increase, thus leading to varicose veins.''Less commonly, varicose veins are caused by such diseases as:''Venous disease (disease of the veins) is generally progressive and may not be prevented entirely. However, in some cases, wearing support hosiery, maintaining a normal weight, and regular ''exercise'' may be beneficial.' phlebitis (inflammation of the veins), blood clots or any obstruction to blood flow in the veins, or congenital abnormalities of the veins."
What are varicose vein symptoms?,"'Many people with varicose veins do not have any physical symptoms. They may, however, have concerns over the cosmetic appearance of the varicose veins.''Symptoms of varicose veins may include:''Some people may complain of a dull ache and pressure sensation from varicose veins.''Some less common, but more severe symptoms of varicose veins may include bleeding, ''thrombophlebitis'' (formation of a ''blood clot'' within the ''varicose vein''), skin ulceration and a weeping oozing ''dermatitis'' or stasis dermatitis. In long standing venous disease, the skin may become fibrotic and scarred, forming an inverted ""hourglass"" appearance. These complications of varicose veins should be evaluated by a doctor promptly.'   aching, cramping, itching, swelling, and fatigue."
How are varicose veins evaluated (diagnosed)?,"""Evaluation of varicose veins includes a thorough general physical examination by a doctor. This will include asking about any family history of varicose veins, the duration and presence of any symptoms, and any worsening or expansion of the varicose veins. The individual's height, weight, and other medical conditions need to be noted as well.""'In addition, general inspection and palpation (feeling the veins) and evaluation for the presence of any bleeding or ulceration also is typically performed. ''Standing up for about 5 to 10 minutes can make the veins more visible, and this may further aid the doctor in assessing the extent of the varicose veins.''Duplex''ultrasound'' visualization is very useful in evaluating of the venous system. Ultrasound can help in delineating the presence of any defective veins and pinpoint those that require intervention.Doppler ultrasound (a device which can detect and measure blood flow) may also provide additional information such as the competency of and flow through the valves in the perforating and the deeper veins. This information is especially necessary if surgery or other procedures are being considered.' "
What treatments are available for varicose veins and spider veins?,"'There are many different treatments available for varicose veins. These treatments vary based upon the size and location of the varicose veins, the presence of symptoms, and in cases of accompanying skin changes (for example, swelling, dermatitis or ulceration, for example). Briefly, potential treatments may include:''In general, sclerotherapy and laser therapy are helpful in treating spider veins (telangiectasias), while ablation and surgery may be a better option for larger varicose veins.''No, not if varicose and spider veins are primarily a cosmetic problem. But severe cases that do not respond to compression therapy, especially those associated with ulcers and dermatitis, generally require further treatment.''Thousands of people every year consider getting treatment for varicose veins and spider veins. Advertisements for treating venous disease often tout ""unique,"" ""permanent,"" ""painless,"" or ""absolutely safe"" methods, thus making it difficult for individuals make a decision on the best treatment option. If you are uncertain about the safety or effectiveness of any treatment check with a health care professional.'   leg elevation while sitting or sleeping, compression dressings with single or multilayered systems, compression stockings, sclerotherapy (injection of a liquid or foam into the vein to form a clot and permanently destroy the vessel), ablation (destruction) of abnormal veins with techniques using laser, radiofrequency or other modalities surgery (removal of the varicose veins, including ""phlebectomy"" or vein stripping)."
How can compression stockings help with varicose veins?,"'Compression stockings work simply by squeezing the leg, thereby reducing the amount of blood and pressure in the veins. There are various brands, styles, and colors of stockings available. The degree of pressure applied around the leg should be guided by a health care professional.  Ideally, they should be fitted when the leg is not swollen, and they can be made-to-order for each patient.  Older or ''obese'' individuals often have difficulty putting on the stockings, which must be worn when the patient is standing. These stockings typically lose some degree of the compression over time  so they may need to be replaced regularly.' "
What is sclerotherapy?,"'""Sclerotherapy"" involves using a fine needle to inject a substance directly into the vein. This solution irritates the lining of the vein, causing the vein to swell and the blood to clot. The vein then turns into ''scar tissue'' that may eventually fade from view. Sclerotherapy is typically used for spider veins and varicose veins. Veins up to 15 millimeters in diameter have been treated successfully. This is generally offered to patients who have tried compression stockings and leg elevation without much success.Today, the substances most commonly used in the United States for sclerotherapy are hypertonic saline and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol), and  polidocanol (Aethoxysklerol, Asclera) is now also approved in the U.S. for sclerotherapy. '""With sclerotherapy, after the solution is injected, the vein's surrounding tissue is generally wrapped in compression bandages for several days, causing the vein walls to stick together. Patients whose legs have been treated are put on ""'walking'"" regimens, which forces the blood to flow into other veins and prevents the development of blood clots. This method and variations of it have been used since the 1920's. In most cases, more than one treatment session will be required."" "
Pictures of sclerotherapy treatment,'Below are pictures of varicose vein and spider vein treatment. ''''' 
What are potential side effects and complications of sclerotherapy?,"'\tIn some patients treated with sclerotherapy, dark discoloration of the injected area may occur (''hyperpigmentation''). This usually happens because of disintegration of the ''red blood cells'' in the treated blood vessel. In the majority of cases, this discoloration will completely go away within 6 months.''\tAnother potential problem is the formation of new spider veins near the area that was treated with sclerotherapy. This can happen in some patients, but these new vessels also typically disappear within 6 months.''\tRare complications may include the formation of an ulcer around the injection site or the formation of small blood clots in the small surface veins (superficial thrombophlebitis).''\tSclerotherapy is generally safe for most people for the treatment of varicose and spider veins. However, in certain groups of people, such as those individuals who are unable to walk (non-ambulatory), sclerotherapy should be avoided. Other contraindications for undergoing sclerotherapy include ''obesity'', blood clots in the deeper veins, ''allergy'' to the sclerosing agent, pregnancy, and arterial obstruction (blocked blood flow in the artery near the varicose vein).' "
What surgical procedures are available to treat varicose veins?,"'Varicose veins are frequently treated by surgically eliminating the ""bad"" veins. This forces the blood to flow through the remaining healthy veins. In vein stripping surgery, the problematic veins are ""stripped"" out by passing a flexible device through the vein and removing it through an incision near the groin. Smaller tributaries of these veins also are stripped with this device or removed through a series of small incisions. Those veins that connect to the deeper veins are then tied off. This stripping method has been used since the 1950\'s. This is now usually performed using outpatient surgical procedures and rarely requires general anesthesia.''Spider veins cannot be removed through surgery. Sometimes, they disappear when the larger varicose veins feeding the spider veins are removed. The remaining spider veins also can be treated with sclerotherapy. ''For all of these procedures, the amount of ''pain'"" an individual feels will vary, depending on the person's general tolerance for ""'pain'', how extensive the treatments are, which parts of the body are treated, whether complications arise, and other factors. Because surgery is performed under anesthesia, pain is not felt during the procedure. After the anesthesia wears off, there can be some pain at or near the incision(s).''For sclerotherapy, the degree of pain will also depend on the size of the needle used and which solution is injected. Most people find hypertonic saline to be the most painful solution and experience a burning and cramping sensation for several minutes when it is injected. Some doctors mix a mild local anesthetic with the saline solution to minimize the pain.'  "
Can laser be used to treat varicose and spider veins?,"'Spider veins and small varicose veins can be treated with laser treatment applied from the surface of the skin. The laser applies an intense energy that essentially destroys the small blood vessels in the surface of the skin. Results are variable, and multiple treatments may be necessary to have some benefit. This procedure is generally less invasive than sclerotherapy and vein stripping (no insertion of needles or catheters is required). A possible problem that may arise after laser treatment is a temporary discoloration of the skin. ''Larger varicose veins may be treated with endovenous (inside the vein) catheter ablation or laser surgery. This basically involves inserting a probe (or catheter) into a large vein in the lower leg (saphenous vein) and closing the vein by applying heat generated through laser. This technique has proven to be less painful, and it also has a faster recovery time compared to vein stripping surgery.' "
What type of doctors provide treatments for varicose and spider veins?,"'Doctors who provide surgical treatments (vein stripping and laser ablation) include general and vascular surgeons. Sclerotherapy and laser treatment are often performed by dermatologists, though some general, vascular, and ''plastic'' surgeons also perform sclerotherapy treatment. Individuals may want to consult more than one health care practitioner prior to making a decision on a method of treatment. Be sure to ask the health care professional about his or her experience in performing the procedure you want.' "
What are the side effects of these treatments?,"'Patients should consult their doctor about the safety and potential side effects of each type of treatment. Thoroughly review any ""informed consent"" forms the doctor gives you explaining the risks of a procedure.''For surgical removal of veins, potential side effects include those for any surgery performed under anesthesia, including ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', as well as the risk of post-operative ''wound'' infection. Surgery may also result in scarring where small incisions are made, and the formation of blood clots is a potential complication as well.''For sclerotherapy, the side effects can depend on the substance used for the injection. People with ''allergies'' may want to be cautious. For example, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol) may cause ''allergic'' reactions, which can occasionally be severe. Hypertonic saline solution is unlikely to cause allergic reactions. Either substance may ''burn'' the skin (if the needle is not properly inserted) or permanently mark or ""stain"" the skin (these brownish marks are caused by the scattering of blood cells throughout the tissue after the vein has been injected and may fade over time). Occasionally, sclerotherapy can lead to the formation of blood clots.''Laser treatments can cause scarring and changes in the color of the skin.''The most worrisome complication of all these treatments is formation of blood clots, which may require further treatments, including blood thinners or other treatment, and have a very low risk of causing death.''Many factors will affect the rate at which treated varicose veins recur. These include the underlying diagnosis, the method used and its suitability for treating the particular condition, and the skill of the physician. Sometimes the body forms a new vein in place of the one removed by a surgeon. An injected vein that was not completely destroyed by sclerotherapy may reopen, or a new vein may appear in the same location as the previous one.''Many studies have found that varicose veins are more likely to recur following sclerotherapy than following surgery. However, no treatment method has been scientifically established as being free from recurrences. For all types of procedures, recurrence rates increase with time. Also, because venous (vein) disease is typically progressive, no treatment can prevent the appearance of new varicose or spider veins in the future.''Is one treatment for varicose veins or spider veins better than the other?'""The method you select for treating venous disease should be based on the physician's diagnosis, the size of the veins to be treated and the patient's:""'As noted above, small spider veins cannot be surgically removed and can only be treated with sclerotherapy. On the other hand, larger varicose veins may, according to many studies, be more likely to recur if treated with sclerotherapy.' treatment history, age, history of allergies, and ability to tolerate surgery and anesthesia, among other factors."
How can varicose veins be prevented? ,"'Prevention'' of varicose veins may be accomplished by periodic leg elevation, avoidance of prolonged standing, and wearing elastic support hose. Regular ''exercise'' and control of weight can also be beneficial. These measures can prevent or slow down the progression of varicose veins.' "
Facts you should know about sclerotherapy," During the sclerotherapy procedure, a health care professional injects chemicals into smaller veins, which damage the inner lining and produce a clot. As the clot is reabsorbed, the vessel is permanently obliterated. The choice of the chemical sclerosing agent and its physical form depend on the size of the vessel to be treated. Treatment of the correct vessels can improve the symptoms of venous insufficiency. Small superficial vessels are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons."
What is sclerotherapy?,"'Sclerotherapy is a medical procedure whereby a chemical, the sclerosant, is injected into a vein to entirely obliterate it. The sclerosant damages the innermost lining of the vessel (the endothelium), resulting in a clot that blocks the blood circulation in the vein beyond. Veins carry unoxygenated blood from the peripheral tissues back to the ''heart''. Since the venous ''blood pressure'' in the veins is low, the blood is pumped by forward by contractions of the heart. To prevent back-flow, most veins have valves that only allow blood only to flow in the direction of the heart. When these valves become incompetent, veins become enlarged and bulging (varicose). Smaller veins that feed these ''varicose veins'' can also become enlarged and appear as red or blue ''spider veins'' in the skin. ''Varicose veins'' can lead to a chronic swelling condition of the leg called venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency predisposes a person to ''leg swelling'', ''blood clots'', and skin ulceration. Even more frequently, damaged veins are manifested as unsightly ''spider veins''. The destruction of these types of veins can be desirable both medically and cosmetically.' "
Is sclerotherapy safe?,"'All medical procedures have risks that should be considered carefully prior to embarking on a particular treatment. Since sclerotherapy is frequently used to treat cosmetic problems, untoward and dangerous side effects ought to be fully explained to the patient.' "
Does sclerotherapy hurt?,"'Because this procedure requires injections through the skin, it is not a painless procedure. Some chemicals that are injected (sclerosants) are more likely to cause ''pain'' than others. If the sclerosant is deposited outside the vein inadvertently, this is often more painful.' "
Is sclerotherapy an effective treatment for varicose veins and spider veins?,"'Sclerotherapy is an effective technique to obliterate or collapse veins. Other techniques include surgical removal of the offending vein, endovenous laser destruction (fiberoptic-transmitted laser light) and, for very small vessels, percutaneous laser light or intense pulsed-light exposure are also effective.'  "
Who is a good candidate for sclerotherapy?,"'Those with venous insufficiency who have disease that is poorly controlled with compression stockings and who are not ''obese'' are ideal candidates for sclerotherapy. To determine if sclerotherapy obliteration is likely to be of benefit, the site of the defective vein is identified as well as the venous drainage pattern. Healthy people who complain of unsightly superficial veins of small caliber (4 mm or less) are also candidates for sclerotherapy.' "
How do people prepare for the sclerotherapy procedure?,"'Patients are screened using special ''ultrasound'' techniques to determine the site of venous disease prior to treatment. In situations where there is only a small area of ''spider veins'', this is rarely done.' "
How does a doctor administer sclerotherapy injections?,"'There are now two FDA-approved sclerosants available, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (a detergent) and polidocanol (Asclera). For small veins, hypertonic saline is occasionally used. Depending on the size of the vein to be treated, the sclerosant may be administered as foam. A needle of the appropriate caliber is inserted into the vessel to be treated, and the chemical is injected.' "
What is the recovery time for sclerotherapy?,'This is an outpatient procedure and the patient leaves the office on the same day of treatment.' 
What aftercare is needed following a sclerotherapy procedure?,'Patients should wear compression dressings for one to three weeks after treatment. A follow-up visit within two weeks to enable the evacuation of blood clots in larger veins can improve the prognosis and the appearance.' 
What are the benefits of sclerotherapy?,"'For patients with venous insufficiency, treatment can be beneficial by improving venous blood flow and limiting chronic swelling. For those with cosmetic complaints, their appearance can be improved.' "
"What are risks, side effects, and complications of sclerotherapy?","'Sclerotherapy risks, side effects, and complications include ''hyperpigmentation'', temporary swelling, capillary dilation (telangiectatic matting), ''pain'' from the injection, localized ''hives'', tape compression ''blister'', tape compression ''folliculitis'', and recurrence, ''vasovagal'' reflex, localized hair growth (hirsutism), skin death (cutaneous necrosis), ''allergic reaction'', superficial ''thrombophlebitis'', arterial injection, ''pulmonary embolism'', ''deep vein thrombosis'', nerve damage, and ''migraine'' ''headaches''.'  "
"Does insurance cover the 
cost of sclerotherapy?","'Although insurance companies differ in their coverage and preapproval is always helpful, the treatment of venous insufficiency is usually covered. The treatment of cosmetic problems including spider veins is rarely covered.' "
Peripheral Artery Disease,"'Like the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries), your peripheral arteries (blood vessels outside your heart) also may develop ''atherosclerosis'', the build-up of fat and ''cholesterol'' deposits, called plaque, on the inside walls. Over time, the build-up narrows the artery. Eventually the narrowed artery causes less blood to flow and a condition called ""ischemia"" can occur. Ischemia is inadequate blood flow to the body\'s tissue.' A blockage in the coronary arteries can cause symptoms of 
chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. A blockage in the carotid arteries (the arteries supplying the brain) can lead to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. A blockage in the legs can lead to leg pain or cramps with activity (a condition called claudication), changes in skin color, sores or ulcers, and feeling tired in the legs. Total loss of circulation can lead to gangrene and loss of a limb. A blockage in the renal arteries (arteries supplying the kidneys) can cause renal artery disease (stenosis). The symptoms include uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, and abnormal kidney function."
Aneurysm,"'An ''aneurysm'' is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. They can form in any blood vessel, but they occur most commonly in the ''aorta'' (''aortic aneurysm'') which is the main blood vessel leaving the heart. The two types of aortic ''aneurysm'' are:''Small aneurysms generally pose no threat. However, one is at increased risk for:' Thoracic aortic aneurysm (part of aorta in the chest) Abdominal aortic aneurysm Atherosclerotic plaque (fat and calcium deposits) formation at the site of the aneurysm. A clot (thrombus) may form at the site and dislodge. Increase in the aneurysm size, causing it to press on other organs, causing pain. Aneurysm rupture -- because the artery wall thins at this spot, it is fragile and may burst under stress. A sudden rupture of an aortic aneurysm may be life threatening."
Renal (Kidney) Artery Disease,"'Renal artery disease is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis of the renal arteries (see above). It occurs in people with generalized vascular disease. Less often, renal artery disease can be caused by a congenital (present at birth) abnormal development of the tissue that makes up the renal arteries. This type of renal artery disease occurs in younger age groups.' "
Raynaud's Phenomenon (Also Called Raynaud's Disease or Raynaud's Syndrome),"""Raynaud's phenomenon consists of spasms of the small arteries of the fingers and sometimes the toes, brought on by exposure to ""'cold'"" or excitement. Certain occupational exposures bring on Raynaud's. The episodes produce temporary lack of blood supply to the area, causing the skin to appear white or bluish and cold or numb. In some cases, the symptoms of Raynaud's may be related to underlying diseases (ie, ""'lupus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''scleroderma'').' "
Buerger's Disease,"""Buerger's disease most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves. Although the cause is unknown, there is a strong association with tobacco use or exposure. The arteries of the arms and legs become narrowed or blocked, causing lack of blood supply (ischemia) to the fingers, hands, toes, and ""'feet''. ''Pain'' occurs in the arms, hands and, more frequently, the legs and feet, even when at rest. With severe blockages, the tissue may die (gangrene), requiring amputation of the fingers and toes.''Superficial ''vein inflammation'"" and symptoms of Raynaud's occur commonly in patients with Buerger's disease."" "
Peripheral Venous Disease,"'Veins are flexible, hollow tubes with flaps inside called valves. When your muscles contract, the valves open and blood moves through the veins. When your muscles relax, the valves close, keeping blood flowing in one direction through the veins.''If the valves inside your veins become damaged, the valves may not close completely. This allows blood to flow in both directions. When your muscles relax, the valves inside the damaged vein(s) will not be able to hold the blood. This can cause pooling of blood or swelling in the veins. The veins bulge and appear as ropes under the skin. The blood begins to move more slowly through the veins, it may stick to the sides of the vessel walls and ''blood clots'' can form.' "
Varicose Veins,"'Varicose veins'' are bulging, swollen, purple, ropy veins, seen just under your skin, caused by damaged valves within the veins. They are more common in women than men and often run in families. They can also be caused by ''pregnancy'', being severely ''overweight'', or by standing for long periods of time. The symptoms of ''varicose veins'' include:' Bulging, swollen, purple, ropy, veins seen under the skin. Spider veins -- small red or purple bursts on your knees, calves, or thighs, caused by swollen capillaries (small blood vessels). Aching, stinging, or swelling of the legs at the end of the day."
Blood Clots In the Veins,"'Blood clots in the veins are usually caused by:''There are many types of blood clots that can occur in the veins:' Long bed rest and/or immobility. Damage to veins from injury or infection. Damage to the valves in the vein, causing pooling near the valve flaps. Pregnancy and hormones (such as estrogen or 
birth control pills). Genetic disorders. Conditions causing slowed blood flow or thicker blood, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), or certain tumors. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot occurring in a deep vein. Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that breaks loose from a vein and travels to the lungs. Chronic venous insufficiency isn't a blood clot, but a condition that occurs when damaged vein valves or a DVT causes long-term pooling of blood and swelling in the legs. If uncontrolled, fluid will leak into the surrounding tissues in the ankles and feet, and may eventually cause skin breakdown and ulceration."
Blood Clotting Disorders,"'Blood clotting disorders are conditions that make the blood more likely to form blood clots in the arteries and veins. These conditions may be ''inherited'' (congenital, occurring at birth) or acquired during life and include:' Elevated levels of factors in the blood which cause blood to clot (fibrinogen, factor 8, prothrombin). Deficiency of natural anticoagulant (blood-thinning) proteins (antithrombin, protein C, protein S). Elevated blood counts. Abnormal fibrinolysis (the breakdown of fibrin). Abnormal changes in the lining of the blood vessels (endothelium)."
Lymphedema,"'The lymphatic system is a circulatory system that includes an extensive network of lymph vessels and ''lymph nodes'"". The lymphatic system helps coordinate the immune system's function to protect the body from foreign substances.""'Lymphedema'' is an abnormal build-up of fluid that causes swelling, most often in the arms or legs. ''Lymphedema'' develops when lymph vessels or lymph nodes are missing, impaired, damaged, or removed.''Primary lymphedema is rare and is caused by the absence of certain lymph vessels at birth, or it may be caused by abnormalities in the lymphatic vessels.''Secondary lymphedema occurs as a result of a blockage or interruption that alters the lymphatic system. Secondary lymphedema can develop from an infection, ''malignancy'', surgery, ''scar tissue'' formation, ''trauma'', ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT''), ''radiation'', or other ''cancer'' treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is vasculitis?,"'Vasculitis is a general term for a group of uncommon diseases that feature inflammation of the blood vessels. The blood vessels of the body are referred to as the vascular system. The blood vessels are comprised of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the ''lungs'' for oxygen. Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation in and damage to the walls of various blood vessels.''Each of the vasculitis diseases is defined by certain patterns of distribution of blood vessel involvement, particular organ involvement, and laboratory test abnormalities. As a group, these diseases are referred to as vasculitides.''The word vasculitis is derived from the Latin ""vasculum"", vessel + ""- itis,"" inflammation. Another term for vasculitis is angiitis. When arteries are the inflamed blood vessels, the condition is also referred to as arteritis. When the veins are inflamed, it is referred to as venulitis.'  "
What causes vasculitis?,"'The actual cause of these vasculitis diseases is usually not known. However, immune system abnormality and inflammation of blood vessels are common features. Each form of vasculitis has its own characteristic pattern of symptoms, much of which depends on what particular organs are affected.''Examples of vasculitis include:''Vasculitis can also accompany:'   Kawasaki disease, Behçet's disease, Polyarteritis nodosa, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,, Cryoglobulinemia, Takayasu's arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Infections (such as hepatitis B), Exposure to chemicals (such as amphetamines and cocaine), Medications, Cancers (such as lymphomas and multiple myeloma), and Rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)."
What are the symptoms of vasculitis?,"'The symptoms of vasculitis vary greatly from person to person, and depend upon the organs affected and the severity.'   Generally, vasculitis causes fatigue and malaise. Sometimes vasculitis can lead to weakness and weight loss. Vasculitis affecting the skin can cause rashes, skin discoloration, and ulcers. Vasculitis affecting the muscles can cause muscle pain. Vasculitis affecting the lungs can cause shortness of breath and cough. Vasculitis affecting the heart can cause congestive heart failure. Vasculitis affecting the brain can cause headaches, confusion, seizures, stroke, paralysis, numbness, and lightheadedness. Vasculitis affecting the kidneys can cause kidney failure."
What tests diagnose vasculitis?,"'Laboratory testing of blood or body fluids in a patient with active vasculitis generally indicates inflammation in the body. Depending on the degree of organ involvement, a variety of organ function tests can be abnormal.''The diagnosis of vasculitis is definitively established after a biopsy of involved tissue demonstrates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation. Examples of tissues used for biopsy include skin, sinuses, lung, nerve, and kidney. Depending upon the situation, an alternative to biopsy can be an X-ray test of the blood vessels called an angiogram, which can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.'  "
What is the treatment for vasculitis?,"'The treatment of the various forms of vasculitis is based on the severity of the illness and the organs involved.''The management of vasculitis is an evolving field in medicine. The ideal programs for monitoring and treatment will continue to improve as disease patterns and causes are defined by medical research.'   Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, cortisone-related medications, such as prednisone , are used. Additionally, other immune suppression drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and others are considered. Additionally, affected organs (such as the heart or lungs) may require specific medical treatment when the disease is active."
Vasectomy overview,"'A vasectomy (pronounced va-SEK-tuh-mee) is a surgical procedure performed as a method of birth control in men. It involves cutting the tubes (the vas deferens, pronounced VAS DEF-uh-renz) that carry sperm from the testicles.''Vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. Only about 15 of every 10,000 couples get ''pregnant'' in the year after the man has a vasectomy.''As part of a program of research on the safety and effectiveness of male contraceptives, the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development (NICHD) supports studies and other activities advancing understanding of vasectomy. '  "
What is vasectomy?,"'A vasectomy is a surgical procedure performed as a method of birth control. It involves cutting the vas deferens (pronounced VAS DEF-uh-renz) in order to close off the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles (there is one vas deferens per testicle). If a man has a vasectomy, he can no longer get a woman pregnant.''1'' Sperm are made in the two testicles, which are inside the scrotum. Sperm is stored in a tube attached to each testicle called the epididymis (pronounced ep-i-DID-uh-mis). When a man ejaculates, the sperm travel from the epididymis, through the vas deferens, and then mix with seminal fluid to form semen. The semen then travels through the urethra (pronounced yoo-REE-thruh) and out the penis. Before a vasectomy, semen contains sperm and seminal fluid. After a vasectomy, sperm are no longer in the semen.''2'"" The man's testicles will make less sperm over time, and his body will absorb any sperm that are made.""'3' "
How is a vasectomy done?,"'A vasectomy is usually performed in the office of ''urologist'', a doctor who specializes in the male urinary tract and reproductive system. In some cases, the urologist may decide to do a vasectomy in an outpatient surgery center or a hospital. This could be because of patient ''anxiety'' or because other procedures will be done at the same time.''2''There are two ways to perform a vasectomy. In either case, the patient is awake during the procedure, but the urologist uses a local anesthetic to numb the scrotum.''With the conventional method, the doctor makes one or two small ''cuts'' in the scrotum to access the vas deferens. A small section of the vas deferens is cut out and then removed. The urologist may cauterize (seal with heat) the ends and then tie the ends with stitches. The doctor will then perform the same procedure on the other testicle, either through the same opening or through a second scrotal incision. For both testicles, when the vas deferens has been tied off, the doctor will use a few stitches or skin ""glue"" to close the opening(s) in the scrotum.''With the ""no-scalpel"" method, a small puncture hole is made on one side of the scrotum. The health care provider will find the vas deferens under the skin and pull it through the hole. The vas deferens is then cut and a small section is removed. The ends are either cauterized or tied off and then put back in place. The procedure is then performed on the other testicle. No stitches are needed with this method because the puncture holes are so small.''1,3''After a vasectomy, most men go home the same day and fully recover in less than a week. '  "
How effective is vasectomy?,"'Vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. In the first year after vasectomy, only 15 to 20 of every 10,000 couples will experience a pregnancy.1,2 In comparison, 1,400 of every 10,000 couples have a pregnancy each year using condoms, and 500 of every 10,000 couples experience a pregnancy each year using oral ''contraceptive'' pills.''4''However, a vasectomy is not effective right away. You still need to use other birth control until the remaining sperm are cleared out of the semen. This takes 15 to 20 ejaculations, or about 3 months. Even then, 1 of every 5 men will still have sperm in his semen and will need to wait longer for the sperm to clear.''2''Your health care provider will check your semen for sperm at least once after the surgery. Once the sperm count has dropped to zero, it is safe to assume your vasectomy is now an effective form of birth control.''2,5'' Until that time, you need to use another form of birth control to make sure your partner does not become pregnant.' "
What are the risks of vasectomy?,"'Although vasectomy is safe and highly effective, men should be aware of problems that could occur after surgery and over time.1''After surgery, most men have discomfort, ''bruising'', and some swelling, all of which usually go away within 2 weeks. Problems that can occur after surgery and need to be checked by a health care provider include:''The risk of other problems is small, but they do occur. These include:' Hematoma. Bleeding under the skin that can lead to painful swelling. Infection. Fever and scrotal redness and tenderness are signs of infection.5 A lump in the scrotum, called a granuloma. This is formed from sperm that leak out of the vas deferens into the tissue.3 Pain in the testicles that doesn't go away. This is called postvasectomy pain syndrome and occurs in about 10% of men.6 Vasectomy failure. There is a small risk that the vasectomy will fail. This can lead to unintended pregnancy. Among 1,000 vasectomies, 11 will likely fail over 2 years; and half of these failures will occur within the first 3 months after surgery.5 The risk of failure depends on a number of factors. For example, some surgical techniques are more likely to fail than others.7 Additionally, there is a very small risk that the two ends of the vas deferens will grow back together. If this happens, sperm may be able to enter the semen and make pregnancy possible.7 Risk of regret. Vasectomy may be a good choice for men and/or couples who are certain that they do not want more or any children. Most men who have vasectomy, as well as spouses of men who have vasectomy, do not regret the decision.5 Men who have vasectomy before age 30 are the group most likely to want a vasectomy reversal in the future.7"
Will vasectomy affect my sex life?,"'Vasectomy will not affect your sex life. It does not decrease your sex drive because it does not affect the production of the male hormone testosterone. It also does not affect your ability to get an erection or ejaculate semen. Because the sperm make up a very small amount of the semen, you will not notice a difference in the amount of semen you ejaculate.''2,8' "
Is vasectomy linked to cancer?,"""Research shows that vasectomy does not increase a man's risk of ""'cancer''. Some studies in the 1990s found that men who had undergone vasectomy had higher rates of ''prostate cancer''. However,\xa0 findings from more recent studies have conclusively shown no link between vasectomy and ''prostate cancer''. Indeed, men who have vasectomy are no more likely to get prostate ''cancer'' than men who do not have vasectomy.''9'"" Vasectomy also does not increase a man's risk of testicular ""'cancer''.''7' "
Does having a vasectomy change my risk for sexually transmitted diseases?,"'A vasectomy does not protect you from getting or passing on any ''sexually transmitted disease'' (STD), including ''HIV''. You must still use condoms or another barrier method to protect yourself from ''STDs''.' "
Can vasectomy be reversed?,"'Almost all vasectomies can be reversed. In a reversal, the cut ends of the vas deferens are reattached. Or, one end of the vas deferens is connected to the part of the testicle where mature sperm are stored.''2''Vasectomy reversal is usually done in an outpatient surgery center or the outpatient area of a hospital. The surgeon may use general anesthesia.''2''To reverse a vasectomy, the surgeon makes a small cut in the side of the scrotum and finds the closed ends of the vas deferens. Then a fluid sample is taken from the end closest to the testicle to test for the presence of sperm. If sperm is found in the fluid, the two closed ends of the vas deferens can be reattached.''2''Many doctors perform the reversal using a microsurgical approach. Here, a high-powered microscope is used to magnify the ends of the vas deferens. It allows the surgeon to use smaller stitches - as small as an eyelash - which reduces scarring. Microsurgery returns sperm to the semen in 75% to 99% of reversals.''2''If no sperm is found in the fluid, there is a blockage in the epididymis or vas deferens. The surgeon gets around this by attaching the upper part of the vas deferens to the epididymis in a place that bypasses the blockage. This procedure is more involved but has nearly as high a success rate as a standard reversal.''2''Recovery from a reversal usually takes 1 to 3 weeks. As with vasectomy, complications from surgery are possible. Most men who undergo vasectomy reversal report the same or less discomfort during recovery than they had after vasectomy.''2''Sperm start appearing in the semen about 3 months after the surgery. However, if the surgeon has to work around a blockage, it can take as long as 15 months for sperm to reappear.''2''On average, it takes 1 year to achieve a pregnancy after a vasectomy reversal.''2'' However, a successful reversal (sperm is returned to the semen) does not guarantee pregnancy. The chance of restored ''fertility'' and pregnancy is highest when the reversal is performed not long after the vasectomy. The likelihood of restored fertility and pregnancy decreases as more time elapses between the vasectomy and the vasectomy reversal.' "
What is a C-section delivery?,"'A cesarean delivery, also called a C-section or cesarean birth, is the surgical ''delivery of a baby'"" through a surgical cut or incision in a woman's abdomen and uterus. After the baby is removed from the womb, the uterus and abdomen are closed with ""'stitches'' that later dissolve.''According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'', in 2015, 32% of births were by cesarean delivery—the lowest rate since 2007. Between 1996 and 2008, the number of cesarean deliveries increased by 72%.' "
What are the reasons for a C-section?,"'Cesarean delivery may be necessary in the following circumstances:' Labor is not progressing. Contractions may not open the cervix enough for the baby to move into the vagina for delivery. The infant's health is in danger. The umbilical cord, which connects the fetus to the uterus, may become pinched, or the fetus may have an abnormal heart rate. In these cases, a cesarean delivery allows the baby to be delivered quickly to address and resolve the baby's health problems. The baby is in the wrong position. Most often when this occurs, the baby is breech, or in a breech presentation, meaning that the baby is coming out feet first instead of head first. The baby may also be in a transverse (sideways) or oblique (diagonal) position. The pregnant woman is delivering two or more fetuses (multiple pregnancy). A cesarean delivery may be needed if labor has started too early (preterm labor), if the fetuses are not in good positions within the uterus for natural delivery, or if there are other problems. The baby is too large. Larger infants are at risk for complications during delivery. These include shoulder dystocia (pronounced dis-TO-she-ah), when the infant's head is delivered through the vagina but the shoulders are stuck.4 Women with gestational diabetes, especially if their blood sugar levels are not well controlled, are at increased risk for having large babies. The placenta has problems. Sometimes the placenta is not formed or working correctly, is in the wrong place in the uterus, or is implanted too deeply or firmly in the uterine wall. These issues can cause problems, such as preventing needed oxygen and nutrients from reaching the fetus or causing vaginal bleeding.5 The mother has an infection, such as HIV or herpes, that could be passed to the baby during vaginal birth. Cesarean delivery could help prevent transmission of the virus to the infant. The mother has a specific medical condition. A cesarean delivery enables the health care provider to better manage the mother's health issues."
What questions should you ask your doctor before a C-section?, Can I have a support person with me during the operation? What are my options for blocking pain? Can I have music played during the surgery? Will I be able to watch the surgery if I want?
What are your options to control pain during a C-section?,"'Women who have a cesarean delivery may be given ''pain'' medication with an epidural block, a spinal block, or general anesthesia.' An epidural block numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine. A spinal block also numbs the lower part of the body, but through an injection directly into the spinal fluid. Women who receive general anesthesia, often used for emergency cesarean deliveries, will not be awake during the surgery."
What should you expect during a C-section?,"'The doctor will make an incision that is about 6 inches long and goes through the skin, fat, and muscle. Most incisions are made side to side and low on the abdomen, called a bikini incision. Once inside the abdominal ''cavity'"", the doctor will make an incision to open the uterus. The opening is made just wide enough for the baby to fit through. One doctor will use a hand to support the baby while another doctor pushes the uterus to help push that baby out. Fluid will be suctioned out of your baby's mouth and nose. The doctor will hold up your baby for you to see.""'Once your baby is delivered, the umbilical cord is cut, and the placenta is removed. Then, the doctor cleans and stitches up the uterus and abdomen. The repair takes up most of the surgery time. Questions to ask:' Can my partner cut the umbilical cord? What happens to my baby right after delivery? Can I hold and touch my baby during the surgery repair? When is it okay for me to try to breastfeed? When can my partner take pictures or video?"
How long does a C-section procedure take?," Cesarean delivery takes about 45 to 60 minutes. It takes place in an operating room. So if you were in a labor and delivery room, you will be moved to an operating room. Often, the mood of the operating room is unhurried and relaxed. A doctor will give you medicine through an epidural or spinal block, which will block the feeling of pain in part of your body, but allows you to stay awake and alert. Spinal blocks work right away and completely numbs your body from the chest down. Epidural blocks take away pain, but you might be aware of some tugging or pushing. Medicine that makes you fall asleep and lose all awareness usually is only used in emergency situations. Your abdomen will be cleaned and prepped. You will have an IV for fluids and medicines. A nurse will insert a catheter to drain urine from your bladder. This is to protect the bladder from harm during surgery. Your heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing also will be monitored."
How long does it take to recover from a C-section?,"'In the weeks ahead, you will need to focus on healing, getting as much rest as possible, and bonding with your baby — nothing else. Be careful about taking on too much and accept help as needed. Questions to ask:' You will be moved to a recovery room and monitored for a few hours. You might feel shaky, nauseated, and very sleepy. Later, you will be brought to a hospital room. When you and your baby are ready, you can hold, snuggle, and nurse your baby. Many people will be excited to see you. But don't accept too many visitors. Use your time in the hospital, usually two to four days, to rest and bond with your baby. C-section is major surgery, and recovery takes about six weeks (not counting the fatigue of new motherhood). Can my baby be brought to me in the recovery room? What are the best positions for me to breastfeed?"
What are the risks and complications of a C-section?,"'Cesarean delivery is a type of surgery, so it has risks and possible complications for both mother and baby.''Possible risks from a cesarean delivery include:''A woman who has a cesarean delivery may also have to stay in the hospital longer than a woman who has had a vaginal delivery.''The more cesarean deliveries a woman has, the greater her risk of certain medical problems and problems with future ''pregnancies'', such as uterine rupture and problems with the placenta.' Infection Blood loss Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder Reaction to medication or anesthesia used It is important to note that these risks also apply, to some degree, to vaginal birth."
Can you request a C-section?,"'Some women may want to have a cesarean birth even if vaginal delivery is an option. Women should discuss their options in detail with their doctor before making a decision about a type of delivery. The decision should consider the impact of the delivery not only on the current pregnancy, but also on future pregnancies. The safest method of delivery for both the mother and the fetus is an uncomplicated vaginal delivery.''Regardless of the type of delivery, unless there is a medical necessity, delivery should not occur before 39 weeks of pregnancy (called ""full term""). Watch this video to learn why it is important for the mother\'s and infant\'s health to wait until at least 39 weeks to deliver unless there is a medical reason to do so earlier.' "
Can you have a vaginal birth after a C-section (VBAC)?,"'Some women who have delivered previous babies by c-section would like to have their next baby vaginally. This is called vaginal delivery after c-section or VBAC. Women give many reasons for wanting a VBAC. Some want to avoid the risks and long recovery of surgery. Others want to experience vaginal delivery.''Today, VBAC is a reasonable and safe choice for most women with prior cesarean delivery, including some women who have had more than one cesarean delivery. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that multiple c-sections can cause serious harm. If you are interested in trying VBAC, ask your doctor if you are a good candidate. A key factor in this decision is the type of incision made to your uterus with previous c-sections.''Your doctor can explain the risks of both repeat cesarean delivery and VBAC. With VBAC, the most serious danger is the chance that the c-section ''scar'' on the uterus will open up during labor and delivery. This is called uterine rupture. Although very rare, uterine rupture is very dangerous for the mother and baby. Less than 1 percent of VBACs lead to uterine rupture. But doctors cannot always predict if uterine rupture is likely to occur in a woman. This risk, albeit very small, is unacceptable to some women.'""The percent of VBACs is dropping in the United States for many reasons. Some doctors, hospitals, and patients have concerns about the safety of VBAC. Some hospitals and doctors are unwilling to do VBACs because of fear of lawsuits and insurance or staffing expenses. Many doctors, however, question if this trend is in the best interest of women's health.""'Choosing to try a VBAC is complex. If you are interested in a VBAC, talk to your doctor and read up on the subject. Only you and your doctor can decide what is best for you. VBACs and planned c-sections both have their benefits and risks. Learn the pros and cons and be aware of possible problems before you make your choice. If your doctor or hospital does not support VBAC, it may be necessary to find providers who will accommodate your wishes.' "
Background,"'Variant CJD (vCJD) is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans. Although experience with this new disease is limited, evidence to date indicates that there has never been a case of vCJD transmitted through direct contact of one person with another. However, a case of probable transmission of vCJD through transfusion of blood components from an asymptomatic donor who subsequently developed the disease has been reported.''Since variant CJD was first reported in 1996, a total of 229 patients with this disease from 12 countries have been identified. As of June 2, 2014, variant CJD cases have been reported from the following countries: 177 from the United Kingdom, 27 from France, 5 from Spain, 4 from Ireland, 4 from the United States, 3 in the Netherlands, 2 in Portugal, 2 in Italy, 2 in Canada and one each from Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan. Two of the four U.S. cases, two of the four cases from Ireland, one of the two cases from Canada, and the single case from Japan were likely exposed to the BSE agent while residing in the United Kingdom.''There has never been a case of vCJD that did not have a history of exposure within a country where the cattle disease, BSE, was occurring.''It is believed that the persons who have developed vCJD became infected through their consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of BSE or in three cases, each reported from the United Kingdom, through receipt of blood from an asymptomatic, infected donor. There is no known treatment of vCJD and it is invariably fatal.' "
vCJD Differs from Classic CJD,"'This variant form of CJD should not be confused with the classic form of CJD that is endemic throughout the world, including the United States. There are several important differences between these two forms of the disease. The median age at death of patients with classic CJD in the United States, for example, is 68 years, and very few cases occur in persons under 30 years of age. In contrast, the median age at death of patients with vCJD in the United Kingdom is 28 years.''vCJD can be confirmed only through examination of brain tissue obtained by biopsy or at ''autopsy'', but a ""probable case"" of vCJD can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria developed in the United Kingdom.''The incubation period for vCJD is unknown because it is a new disease. However, it is likely that ultimately this incubation period will be measured in terms of many years or decades. In other words, whenever a person develops vCJD from consuming a BSE-contaminated product, he or she likely would have consumed that product many years or a decade or more earlier.''In contrast to classic CJD, vCJD in the United Kingdom predominantly affects younger people, has atypical clinical features, with prominent psychiatric or sensory symptoms at the time of clinical presentation and delayed onset of neurologic abnormalities, including ''ataxia'' within weeks or months, ''dementia'' and myoclonus late in the illness, a duration of illness of at least 6 months, and a diffusely abnormal non-diagnostic ''electroencephalogram''.''The BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom reached its peak incidence in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. The outbreak may have resulted from the feeding of scrapie-containing sheep meat-and-bone meal to cattle. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was amplified by feeding rendered bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.' "
U.S. Surveillance for variant CJD,"'The possibility that BSE can spread to humans has focused increased attention on the desirability of enhancing national surveillance for ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' (CJD) in the United States in order to detect variant CJD. Improving methods to detect classic CJD, such as increasing the number of autopsies on patients with suspected prion disease, enhances the ability to identify cases of variant CJD.''The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) monitors the trends and current incidence of classic CJD in the United States through several surveillance mechanisms. The oldest and most systematic method includes analyzing death certificate information from U.S. multiple cause-of-death data, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. During 1979-2003 the average annual age adjusted death rates of classic CJD have remained relatively stable. Moreover, deaths from non-iatrogenic CJD in persons aged <30 years in the United States remain extremely rare (<5 cases per 1 billion per year). In contrast, in the United Kingdom, over half of the patients who died with vCJD were in this young age group.''In addition, CDC collects, reviews and when indicated, actively investigates reports by health care personnel or institutions of possible iatrogenic CJD and variant CJD cases. Finally and very importantly, in 1996-97, CDC established, in collaboration with the American Association of Neuropathologists, the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University, which performs special diagnostic tests for prion diseases, including post-mortem tests that can detect vCJD.' "
vCJD Cases Reported in the US,"'Four cases of vCJD have been reported from the United States. By convention, variant CJD cases are ascribed to the country of initial symptom onset, regardless of where the exposure occurred. There is strong evidence that suggests that two of the four cases were exposed to the BSE agent in the United Kingdom and that the third was exposed while living in Saudi Arabia. The history of the fourth patient, including extensive travel to Europe and the Middle East, supports the likelihood that infection occurred outside the United States.'""The first patient was born in the United Kingdom in the late 1970's and lived there until a move to Florida in 1992. The patient had onset of symptoms in November 2001 and died in June of 2004. The patient never donated or received blood, plasma, or organs, never received human growth hormone, nor did the patient ever have major surgery other than having ""'wisdom teeth'' extracted in 2001. Additionally, there was no family history of CJD.'""The second patient resided in Texas during 2001-2005. Symptoms began in early 2005 while the patient was in Texas. He then returned to the United Kingdom, where his illness progressed, and a diagnosis of variant CJD was made. The diagnosis was confirmed neuropathologically at the time of the patient's death. While living in the United States, the patient had no history of hospitalization, of having invasive medical procedures, or of donation or receipt of blood and blood products. The patient almost certainly acquired the disease in the United Kingdom. He was born in the United Kingdom and lived there throughout the defined period of risk (1980-1996) for human exposure to the agent of bovine spongiform ""'encephalopathy'' (BSE, commonly known as ""mad cow"" disease). His stay in the United States was too brief relative to what is known about the incubation period for variant CJD.'""The third patient was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and has lived in the United States since late 2005. The patient occasionally stayed in the United States for up to 3 months at a time since 2001 and there was a shorter visit in 1989. The patient's onset of symptoms occurred in Spring 2006. In late November 2006, the Clinical Prion Research Team at the University of California San Francisco Memory and ""'Aging'"" Center confirmed the vCJD clinical diagnosis by pathologic study of adenoid and brain biopsy tissues. The patient has no history of receipt of blood, a past neurosurgical procedure, or residing in or visiting countries of Europe. Based on the patient's history, the occurrence of a previously reported Saudi case of vCJD attributed to likely consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle products in Saudi Arabia, and the expected greater than 7 year incubation period for food-related vCJD, this U.S. case-patient was most likely infected from contaminated cattle products consumed as a child when living in Saudi Arabia. The patient has no history of donating blood and the public health investigation has identified no known risk of transmission to U.S. residents from this patient.""""The fourth patient died in Texas in May 2014. Laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of variant CJD. The confirmation was made when laboratory results from an autopsy of the patient's brain tested positive for variant CJD."" "
Prevention Measures against BSE Spread,"'To prevent BSE from entering the United States, severe restrictions were placed on the importation of live ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, and certain ruminant products from countries where BSE was known to exist. These restrictions were later extended to include importation of ruminants and certain ruminant products from all European countries.''Because the use of ruminant tissue in ruminant feed was probably a necessary factor responsible for the BSE outbreak in the United Kingdom and because of the current evidence for possible transmission of BSE to humans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration instituted a ruminant feed ban in June 1997 that became fully effective as of October 1997. As of October 26, 2009, a regulation issued by FDA in April 2009 came into effect establishing an enhanced BSE-related feed ban in the U.S. This enhanced feed ban will further harmonize BSE feed control measures in the U.S. with those in Canada (see below). In addition, FDA continues to enforce its important 1997 mammalian-to-ruminant feed ban through its BSE inspection and BSE feed testing programs.''As of July 12, 2007, an enhanced BSE-related feed ban came into effect in Canada. CFIA established this ban to more effectively prevent and quickly eliminate BSE from Canada. The enhanced ban prohibits most proteins, including potentially BSE infectious tissues known as ""specified risk materials"" (SRM) from all animal feeds, pet foods, and fertilizers, not just from cattle feed as required by the ban instituted in 1997. The 1997 feed ban in Canada was similar to the feed ban instituted in the United States that same year. As recently reported by CFIA, removing SRM from the entire animal feed system addresses risks associated with the potential contamination of cattle feed during production, distribution, storage, and use. Applying the same measure to pet food and fertilizer materials addresses the possible exposure of cattle and other susceptible animals to these products. With this ban in place, CFIA expects BSE should be eliminated from the Canadian cattle herd by about the year 2017.''In late 2001, the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment study of various scenarios involving BSE in the U.S. concluded that the FDA ruminant feed rule provides a major defense against this disease.'

What are veins and what is their function?,"'Veins are blood vessels that return blood from all the organs in the body toward the heart. When the different organs use oxygen from the blood to perform their functions, they release the used blood containing waste products (such as carbon dioxide) into the veins. Blood in the veins is then transported to the heart and returned to the lungs, where the waste carbon dioxide is released and more oxygen is loaded by the blood and taken back to the rest of the body by the arteries.''Veins also act as a storage for unused blood. When the body is at rest, only a portion of the available blood in the body circulates. The rest of the blood remains inactive in the veins and enters the active circulation when the body becomes more active and needs the additional blood to carry oxygen to the entire body. This storing capacity is due to the elasticity (flexibility to expand) of the walls of the veins.''Veins have different sizes that depends their location and function. The largest veins are in the center of the body; these collect the blood from all the other smaller veins and channel it into the heart. The branches of these large veins get smaller and smaller as they move away from the center of the body. The veins closer to the skin surface are called superficial veins. The veins that are deeper and closer to the center of the body are called deep veins. There are also other veins that connect the superficial veins to the deep veins, and these are called perforating veins.' "
What are varicose veins and spider veins?,"'Veins can bulge with pools of blood when they fail to circulate the blood properly. These visible and bulging veins, called varicose veins, are more common in the legs and thighs, but can develop anywhere in the body.''Large varicose veins'' can be visible, bulging, palpable (can be felt by touching), long, and dilated (greater than 4 millimeters in diameter). ''Small ""''spider veins''""'' also can appear on the skin\'s surface. These may look like short, fine lines, ""starburst"" clusters, or a web-like maze. They are typically not palpable. Spider veins are most common in the thighs, ankles, and ''feet''. They may also appear on the face. The medical term for spider veins is ''telangiectasias''.' "

Who gets varicose and spider veins?,"'Varicose and spider veins can occur in men or women of any age, but most frequently affect women in the childbearing years and older people. Varicose veins are very common. Some estimates suggest that about 10% to 15% of men and most older women who have varicose or spider veins.'""A family history of varicose veins and older age increase one's tendency to develop varicose and spider veins. ""'Other risk factors include:' a sedentary lifestyle,  weight gain,  prolonged standing, and  pregnancy."
What causes varicose and spider veins? ,"'The causes of varicose and spider veins are not entirely understood. In some instances, the absence or ''weakness'' of valves in the veins may cause poor venous circulation (blood flow in the veins) and lead to varicose veins. Valves inside veins normally act to ensure that blood in the veins does not flow in a backward direction (retrograde) away from the large (deep) veins and the heart. They are mainly located in perforating veins and some deep veins.''In other cases, weaknesses in the vein walls may cause pooling of the blood. The walls of the blood vessels can become weaker and less competent than normal, causing the volume of blood in the veins to increase, thus leading to varicose veins.''Less commonly, varicose veins are caused by such diseases as:''Venous disease (disease of the veins) is generally progressive and may not be prevented entirely. However, in some cases, wearing support hosiery, maintaining a normal weight, and regular ''exercise'' may be beneficial.' phlebitis (inflammation of the veins), blood clots or any obstruction to blood flow in the veins, or congenital abnormalities of the veins."
What are varicose vein symptoms?,"'Many people with varicose veins do not have any physical symptoms. They may, however, have concerns over the cosmetic appearance of the varicose veins.''Symptoms of varicose veins may include:''Some people may complain of a dull ache and pressure sensation from varicose veins.''Some less common, but more severe symptoms of varicose veins may include bleeding, ''thrombophlebitis'' (formation of a ''blood clot'' within the ''varicose vein''), skin ulceration and a weeping oozing ''dermatitis'' or stasis dermatitis. In long standing venous disease, the skin may become fibrotic and scarred, forming an inverted ""hourglass"" appearance. These complications of varicose veins should be evaluated by a doctor promptly.'   aching, cramping, itching, swelling, and fatigue."
How are varicose veins evaluated (diagnosed)?,"""Evaluation of varicose veins includes a thorough general physical examination by a doctor. This will include asking about any family history of varicose veins, the duration and presence of any symptoms, and any worsening or expansion of the varicose veins. The individual's height, weight, and other medical conditions need to be noted as well.""'In addition, general inspection and palpation (feeling the veins) and evaluation for the presence of any bleeding or ulceration also is typically performed. ''Standing up for about 5 to 10 minutes can make the veins more visible, and this may further aid the doctor in assessing the extent of the varicose veins.''Duplex''ultrasound'' visualization is very useful in evaluating of the venous system. Ultrasound can help in delineating the presence of any defective veins and pinpoint those that require intervention.Doppler ultrasound (a device which can detect and measure blood flow) may also provide additional information such as the competency of and flow through the valves in the perforating and the deeper veins. This information is especially necessary if surgery or other procedures are being considered.' "
What treatments are available for varicose veins and spider veins?,"'There are many different treatments available for varicose veins. These treatments vary based upon the size and location of the varicose veins, the presence of symptoms, and in cases of accompanying skin changes (for example, swelling, dermatitis or ulceration, for example). Briefly, potential treatments may include:''In general, sclerotherapy and laser therapy are helpful in treating spider veins (telangiectasias), while ablation and surgery may be a better option for larger varicose veins.''No, not if varicose and spider veins are primarily a cosmetic problem. But severe cases that do not respond to compression therapy, especially those associated with ulcers and dermatitis, generally require further treatment.''Thousands of people every year consider getting treatment for varicose veins and spider veins.

If you are uncertain about the safety or effectiveness of any treatment check with a health care professional.'   leg elevation while sitting or sleeping, compression dressings with single or multilayered systems, compression stockings, sclerotherapy (injection of a liquid or foam into the vein to form a clot and permanently destroy the vessel), ablation (destruction) of abnormal veins with techniques using laser, radiofrequency or other modalities surgery (removal of the varicose veins, including ""phlebectomy"" or vein stripping)."
How can compression stockings help with varicose veins?,"'Compression stockings work simply by squeezing the leg, thereby reducing the amount of blood and pressure in the veins. There are various brands, styles, and colors of stockings available. The degree of pressure applied around the leg should be guided by a health care professional.  Ideally, they should be fitted when the leg is not swollen, and they can be made-to-order for each patient.  Older or ''obese'' individuals often have difficulty putting on the stockings, which must be worn when the patient is standing. These stockings typically lose some degree of the compression over time  so they may need to be replaced regularly.' "
What is sclerotherapy?,"'""Sclerotherapy"" involves using a fine needle to inject a substance directly into the vein. This solution irritates the lining of the vein, causing the vein to swell and the blood to clot. The vein then turns into ''scar tissue'' that may eventually fade from view. Sclerotherapy is typically used for spider veins and varicose veins. Veins up to 15 millimeters in diameter have been treated successfully. This is generally offered to patients who have tried compression stockings and leg elevation without much success.Today, the substances most commonly used in the United States for sclerotherapy are hypertonic saline and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol), and  polidocanol (Aethoxysklerol, Asclera) is now also approved in the U.S. for sclerotherapy. '""With sclerotherapy, after the solution is injected, the vein's surrounding tissue is generally wrapped in compression bandages for several days, causing the vein walls to stick together. Patients whose legs have been treated are put on ""'walking'"" regimens, which forces the blood to flow into other veins and prevents the development of blood clots. This method and variations of it have been used since the 1920's. In most cases, more than one treatment session will be required."" "

What are potential side effects and complications of sclerotherapy?,"'\tIn some patients treated with sclerotherapy, dark discoloration of the injected area may occur (''hyperpigmentation''). This usually happens because of disintegration of the ''red blood cells'' in the treated blood vessel. In the majority of cases, this discoloration will completely go away within 6 months.''\tAnother potential problem is the formation of new spider veins near the area that was treated with sclerotherapy. This can happen in some patients, but these new vessels also typically disappear within 6 months.''\tRare complications may include the formation of an ulcer around the injection site or the formation of small blood clots in the small surface veins (superficial thrombophlebitis).''\tSclerotherapy is generally safe for most people for the treatment of varicose and spider veins. However, in certain groups of people, such as those individuals who are unable to walk (non-ambulatory), sclerotherapy should be avoided. Other contraindications for undergoing sclerotherapy include ''obesity'', blood clots in the deeper veins, ''allergy'' to the sclerosing agent, pregnancy, and arterial obstruction (blocked blood flow in the artery near the varicose vein).' "
What surgical procedures are available to treat varicose veins?,"'Varicose veins are frequently treated by surgically eliminating the ""bad"" veins. This forces the blood to flow through the remaining healthy veins. In vein stripping surgery, the problematic veins are ""stripped"" out by passing a flexible device through the vein and removing it through an incision near the groin. Smaller tributaries of these veins also are stripped with this device or removed through a series of small incisions. Those veins that connect to the deeper veins are then tied off. This stripping method has been used since the 1950\'s. This is now usually performed using outpatient surgical procedures and rarely requires general anesthesia.''Spider veins cannot be removed through surgery. Sometimes, they disappear when the larger varicose veins feeding the spider veins are removed. The remaining spider veins also can be treated with sclerotherapy. ''For all of these procedures, the amount of ''pain'"" an individual feels will vary, depending on the person's general tolerance for ""'pain'', how extensive the treatments are, which parts of the body are treated, whether complications arise, and other factors. Because surgery is performed under anesthesia, pain is not felt during the procedure. After the anesthesia wears off, there can be some pain at or near the incision(s).''For sclerotherapy, the degree of pain will also depend on the size of the needle used and which solution is injected. Most people find hypertonic saline to be the most painful solution and experience a burning and cramping sensation for several minutes when it is injected. Some doctors mix a mild local anesthetic with the saline solution to minimize the pain.'  "
Can laser be used to treat varicose and spider veins?,"'Spider veins and small varicose veins can be treated with laser treatment applied from the surface of the skin. The laser applies an intense energy that essentially destroys the small blood vessels in the surface of the skin. Results are variable, and multiple treatments may be necessary to have some benefit. This procedure is generally less invasive than sclerotherapy and vein stripping (no insertion of needles or catheters is required). A possible problem that may arise after laser treatment is a temporary discoloration of the skin. ''Larger varicose veins may be treated with endovenous (inside the vein) catheter ablation or laser surgery. This basically involves inserting a probe (or catheter) into a large vein in the lower leg (saphenous vein) and closing the vein by applying heat generated through laser. This technique has proven to be less painful, and it also has a faster recovery time compared to vein stripping surgery.' "
What type of doctors provide treatments for varicose and spider veins?,"'Doctors who provide surgical treatments (vein stripping and laser ablation) include general and vascular surgeons. Sclerotherapy and laser treatment are often performed by dermatologists, though some general, vascular, and ''plastic'' surgeons also perform sclerotherapy treatment. Individuals may want to consult more than one health care practitioner prior to making a decision on a method of treatment. Be sure to ask the health care professional about his or her experience in performing the procedure you want.' "
What are the side effects of these treatments?,"'Patients should consult their doctor about the safety and potential side effects of each type of treatment. Thoroughly review any ""informed consent"" forms the doctor gives you explaining the risks of a procedure.''For surgical removal of veins, potential side effects include those for any surgery performed under anesthesia, including ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', as well as the risk of post-operative ''wound'' infection. Surgery may also result in scarring where small incisions are made, and the formation of blood clots is a potential complication as well.''For sclerotherapy, the side effects can depend on the substance used for the injection. People with ''allergies'' may want to be cautious. For example, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (Sotradecol) may cause ''allergic'' reactions, which can occasionally be severe. Hypertonic saline solution is unlikely to cause allergic reactions. Either substance may ''burn'' the skin (if the needle is not properly inserted) or permanently mark or ""stain"" the skin (these brownish marks are caused by the scattering of blood cells throughout the tissue after the vein has been injected and may fade over time). Occasionally, sclerotherapy can lead to the formation of blood clots.''Laser treatments can cause scarring and changes in the color of the skin.''The most worrisome complication of all these treatments is formation of blood clots, which may require further treatments, including blood thinners or other treatment, and have a very low risk of causing death.''Many factors will affect the rate at which treated varicose veins recur. These include the underlying diagnosis, the method used and its suitability for treating the particular condition, and the skill of the physician. Sometimes the body forms a new vein in place of the one removed by a surgeon. An injected vein that was not completely destroyed by sclerotherapy may reopen, or a new vein may appear in the same location as the previous one.''Many studies have found that varicose veins are more likely to recur following sclerotherapy than following surgery. However, no treatment method has been scientifically established as being free from recurrences. For all types of procedures, recurrence rates increase with time. Also, because venous (vein) disease is typically progressive, no treatment can prevent the appearance of new varicose or spider veins in the future.''Is one treatment for varicose veins or spider veins better than the other?'""The method you select for treating venous disease should be based on the physician's diagnosis, the size of the veins to be treated and the patient's:""'As noted above, small spider veins cannot be surgically removed and can only be treated with sclerotherapy. On the other hand, larger varicose veins may, according to many studies, be more likely to recur if treated with sclerotherapy.' treatment history, age, history of allergies, and ability to tolerate surgery and anesthesia, among other factors."
How can varicose veins be prevented? ,"'Prevention'' of varicose veins may be accomplished by periodic leg elevation, avoidance of prolonged standing, and wearing elastic support hose. Regular ''exercise'' and control of weight can also be beneficial. These measures can prevent or slow down the progression of varicose veins.' "

Hypertonic saline solution is unlikely to cause allergic reactions. Either substance may ''burn'' the skin (if the needle is not properly inserted) or permanently mark or ""stain"" the skin (these brownish marks are caused by the scattering of blood cells throughout the tissue after the vein has been injected and may fade over time). Occasionally, sclerotherapy can lead to the formation of blood clots.''Laser treatments can cause scarring and changes in the color of the skin.''The most worrisome complication of all these treatments is formation of blood clots, which may require further treatments, including blood thinners or other treatment, and have a very low risk of causing death.''Many factors will affect the rate at which treated varicose veins recur. These include the underlying diagnosis, the method used and its suitability for treating the particular condition, and the skill of the physician. Sometimes the body forms a new vein in place of the one removed by a surgeon. An injected vein that was not completely destroyed by sclerotherapy may reopen, or a new vein may appear in the same location as the previous one.''Many studies have found that varicose veins are more likely to recur following sclerotherapy than following surgery. However, no treatment method has been scientifically established as being free from recurrences. For all types of procedures, recurrence rates increase with time. Also, because venous (vein) disease is typically progressive, no treatment can prevent the appearance of new varicose or spider veins in the future.''Is one treatment for varicose veins or spider veins better than the other?'""The method you select for treating venous disease should be based on the physician's diagnosis, the size of the veins to be treated and the patient's:""'As noted above, small spider veins cannot be surgically removed and can only be treated with sclerotherapy. On the other hand, larger varicose veins may, according to many studies, be more likely to recur if treated with sclerotherapy.' treatment history, age, history of allergies, and ability to tolerate surgery and anesthesia, among other factors."
How can varicose veins be prevented? ,"'Prevention'' of varicose veins may be accomplished by periodic leg elevation, avoidance of prolonged standing, and wearing elastic support hose. Regular ''exercise'' and control of weight can also be beneficial. These measures can prevent or slow down the progression of varicose veins.' "
What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which a tube is inserted through the mouth down into the trachea (the large ''airway'' from the mouth to the ''lungs''). Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.' "
What kind of tube is used?,'The tube that is used today is usually a flexible ''plastic'' tube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.' 
How do they put the tube down into the trachea?,"""The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization. Pressure is often applied to the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) to help with visualization and prevent possible aspiration of stomach contents."" "
What is the purpose of endotracheal intubation?,"'The endotracheal tube serves as an open passage through the upper airway. The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to permit air to pass freely to and from the lungs in order to ventilate the lungs. Endotracheal tubes can be connected to ventilator machines to provide artificial ''respiration''. This can help when a patient is unconscious and by maintaining a patent airway, especially during surgery. It is often used when patients are critically ill and cannot maintain adequate respiratory function to meet their needs. The endotracheal tube facilitates the use of a mechanical ventilator in these critical situations.'  "
Is endotracheal intubation used for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'Endotracheal intubation is the approved way of providing ''breathing'' support to ''COVID-19'"" coronavirus disease patients as of this article's update in early April, 2020.\xa0""'Non-invasive mechanical ventilation\xa0like ''CPAP'' (continuous positive airway pressure) machines used for ''sleep apnea'' are not good for ''COVID-19'"" patients, according to clinical guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In some cases, CPAP\xa0masks or\xa0nasal pillows\xa0may provide adequate oxygen, but current devices aerosolize\xa0virus particles in the patient's breath and spread them around wherever\xa0the patient is housed, potentially infecting\xa0more people in the area.""'Endotracheal intubation and ventilation supports a ''COVID-19'"" patient's breathing so the body can survive as\xa0the immune system fights the virus. This means a better chance of\xa0fighting off the virus, but ventilators can't cure COVID-19."" "
What are the complications of endotracheal intubation?,"'If the tube is inadvertently placed in the ''esophagus'' (right behind the trachea), adequate respirations will not occur. ''Brain damage'', ''cardiac arrest'', and death can occur. Aspiration of stomach contents can result in ''pneumonia'' and ''ARDS''. Placement of the tube too deep can result in only one lung being ventilated and can result in a ''pneumothorax'' as well as inadequate ventilation. During endotracheal tube placement, damage can also occur to the ''teeth'', the soft tissues in the back of the throat, as well as the vocal cords.''This procedure should be performed by a physician with experience in intubation. In the vast majority of cases of intubation, no significant complications occur.'  "
What is a ventricular septal defect (VSD)?,"'A ''ventricular septal defect'' (VSD) is a heart malformation present at birth. Any condition that is present at birth can also be termed a ""congenital"" condition. A VSD, therefore, is a type of congenital ''heart disease'' (CHD). The heart with a VSD has a hole in the wall (the septum) between its two lower chambers (the ventricles).' "
How common is a VSD?,"'The most frequent types of ''congenital malformations'' affect the heart. It is estimated that approximately eight in 1,000 newborns have CHD. A VSD is the most frequent of the various types of CHD (25%-30% of all CHD). Approximately one infant in 500 will be born with a VSD.' "
What is the normal design of the heart?,"'The heart is made up of four separate chambers. The upper right chamber (''atrium'') receives blood back from the body with much of the oxygen extracted by the body organs and tissues. The blood is then pumped through a one-way valve into the lower right chamber (ventricle) from which it is pumped to the lungs to be again enriched with oxygen. This highly oxygenated blood then returns to the upper left-sided chamber (''atrium'') and next passes through a one-way valve into the lower left chamber (ventricle). From there, the oxygenated blood is pumped out into a large blood vessel (the ''aorta'') and is distributed throughout the body through arteries.''The two upper chambers (right and left atria) are separated by a wall of muscle called the septum. Similarly, the two lower chambers (right and left ventricles) are also separated by a separate muscular septum. These septa (plural of septum) keep the lower oxygenated blood that has returned from the body from mixing with the highly oxygenated blood which has returned from the lungs.''A VSD is a hole in the ventricular septum.' "
How do VSDs cause problems?,"'The pressure generated during contraction by the left ventricle (LV) is higher than that generated by the simultaneous contraction of the right ventricle (RV). Blood will thus be pushed through the VSD (also called ""shunted"") from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. The right ventricle has to do extra work to handle the additional blood volume. It may have trouble expelling this larger volume of blood and compromise the ability to pump efficiently. In addition, the lungs receive too much blood under too much pressure. The arterioles (small arteries) in the lungs thicken in response to the excess blood under excess pressure. If this extra pressure persists, permanent damage can be done to the lungs.''It makes a considerable difference whether the size of the VSD is small or large.  A larger VSD will allow more blood to be shunted from the higher-pressure LV to the lower pressure RV.  As noted above, this will promote enlargement of the RV.  It also promotes mixing of the highly oxygenated LV blood with the less oxygenated RV.  This lower oxygenated blood is circulated throughout the body.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a VSD?,"'An infant with a VSD will generally not start to demonstrate abnormalities until 2 or 3 days of life.  Common observations may include: (1) poor feeding (tires easily, poor suck); (2) rapid heart rate and respiratory rate; (3) unusual fussiness; and (4) pallor (paleness of the skin) and ''cyanosis'' (blue tinge of the skin).  Should the presence of a VSD be missed, infants may demonstrate: (1) poor ''weight gain'', (2) enlargement of the ''liver'' in association with ''congestive heart failure'' (inability to effectively pump blood); (3) ''shock'' and (4) possibly death.' "
How do doctors diagnose a VSD?,"'The diagnosis of a VSD is usually suspected clinically by ''hearing'' a characteristic ''heart murmur''. A murmur is a sound generated by abnormally turbulent flow of blood through the heart. This murmur is the result of blood being shunted through the VSD from the higher-pressure left ventricle into the lower-pressure right ventricle. At birth, this pressure imbalance is minimal and does not usually develop until later in the first week of life. As such, it is rare for a doctor to hear the murmur of a VSD until the baby is a few days of age.''The evaluation of a child with a possible VSD is designed to confirm the diagnosis but also to check for other anatomical defects in the heart and to estimate the size of the shunt of blood from the left to right ventricle.''Such an evaluation usually begins with an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', sometimes also abbreviated ''ECG'') and possibly a ''chest X-ray''. A soundwave test of the heart (''echocardiogram'') is used to define the anatomy and evaluate the characteristics (amount and pressures) of the shunted blood. With the advent of superb ''echocardiography'', the previously required ''cardiac catheterization'' is rarely necessary.''The infant will commonly have reduced blood oxygen levels due to shunting of the LV blood into the RV.  Most hospitals test for upper and lower blood oxygen levels (pulse ''oximetry'') prior to discharging an infant from the hospital.  Further studies and a consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should be undertaken prior to the infant being sent home. ' "
What if the VSD is small?,"'Small defects (less than 0.5 square cm) are common. With a small VSD, there is minimal shunting of blood and the pressure in the right ventricle remains normal. Since the right ventricular pressure is normal, there is no damage to the lung arterioles. The heart functions normally. A prominent murmur heard through a stethoscope is usually the only sign that brings the VSD to attention. This murmur is commonly noted during the first week of life.' "
What are treatment options for a small VSD?,"'One-third to one-half of all small VSDs close spontaneously (on their own). This seemingly miraculous event occurs most often before the baby is 1 year old, almost always before age 4 (75% by 2 years of age). The closure is due to the small VSD being located between heart fibers that increase in size in time, thus encroaching upon the opening in the ventricular septum.''Even if a small VSD does not close spontaneously, surgical repair is usually not recommended. However, long-term follow-up is required.' "
What if the VSD is large?,"'With a large VSD (usually one greater than 1 cm''2''), there is significant shunting of blood from the left ventricle into the right ventricle. Thus extra blood volume puts a strain on the right ventricle and causes an increase in the ''blood pressure'' of the lungs called ""''pulmonary hypertension''."" The child may have labored ''breathing'', difficulty feeding, poor growth, and have pallor.' "
What is the treatment for a large VSD?,"'Ultimately, the patient with a large VSD will need surgery to ""patch the hole"" in the ventricular septum. The timing of surgery is an individualized decision based upon several factors. These include' The extent and duration of increased pulmonary artery pressure are 
considered. Chronic pulmonary arteriolar pressure may become irreversible and put a strain on the right ventricle. These side effects may be treated with medications until surgery is appropriate. A child with a large VSD often will not grow as robustly as his peers. The work of increased metabolic demands often requires additional calories when compared to children without such a cardiac defect. High-calorie dense supplements may be added to formula. Some infants may require nighttime continuous feedings using a tube that is passed through the nose to the stomach (nasogastric tube) to maximize growth. It is very rare to restrict fluid volumes in these children. Infants with iron-deficiency anemia should receive iron supplements to maximize the oxygen carrying capacity of their blood. Blood transfusions to address such an anemia are rare."
What types of surgery are available to correct a VSD?,"""There are two types of surgery available to correct a VSD: the intra-cardiac technique and the trans-catheter technique. The surgical technique is chosen based upon the nature of the VSD and associated side effects on the patient's heart and lungs. The intra-cardiac approach is the most common technique and is done while the patient is under ""'cardiopulmonary bypass'' (a ""heart-lung machine"") and is an open-heart operation. This is the procedure of choice for most children and at most pediatric surgical centers. A second technique uses surgical instruments that are passed through catheters placed in the patient\'s large blood vessels into the heart. This ""trans-catheter approach"" is generally more difficult and should only be considered on select patients and at pediatric centers that have expertise in such a procedure.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) after a VSD is repaired?,"""After a successful surgical repair of the VSD, the two ventricles are entirely separate from each other and the circulation of the blood within the heart is normal. If the RV was enlarged, it can return to a more normal size. The high pressure in the pulmonary artery should also begin to resolve. If the child's growth had slowed, the child usually catches up within a year or two. Long-term follow-up is required. The long-term prognosis is usually excellent."" "
What are complications of VSD surgery?,"'Complications with intra-cardiac VSD surgery are uncommon. Currently, most centers have an operative mortality rate of less than 1% if the VSD is the only defect and the heart is functioning normally. Major complications are rare (1%-2%) and include heart rhythm problems and incomplete closure of the VSD. Rarely, a ''pacemaker'' insertion or a second procedure to repair the defect may be necessary.' "
What about unusual cases of VSD?,"'There are rare cases of VSD that may be harder to treat. These are most commonly VSDs which are associated with other cardiac defects (for example, Tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta). Cases with multiple VSDs (""Swiss cheese"" defects) are also harder to treat.' "
What are long-term precautions with VSDs?,"'Repaired or not, whether small or large, a VSD creates an increased risk for infections of the heart walls and valves (''endocarditis'""). Such an infection may be life-threatening. To help prevent endocarditis, a patient with a VSD (repaired or not) may need to take antibiotics before dental procedures, including cleaning and other dental care, and before surgical procedures on the mouth or throat. Long-term precautions should be discussed with the person's doctors. Previous recommendations for preoperative antibiotics before instrumentation of the urinary tract or lower intestinal tract were rescinded by the American Heart Association in 2007."" "
What is vertigo?,"'Vertigo'' is the sense of the world spinning, rotating, or rocking that is experienced even when a person is holding perfectly still. Some patients use the term ''vertigo'' interchangeably with ''dizziness'' to describe a variety of symptoms, ranging from ''balance disorders'' and difficulty with ''walking'' to ''motion sickness'' or ''lightheadedness''. However, most health care professionals consider ''vertigo'' to be a specific complaint that involves the balance centers of the inner ear and the brain.'""To understand vertigo, it's helpful to understand the anatomy of the ear. Sound waves travel through the ""'outer ear'' canal until they reach the eardrum. From there, sound turns into vibrations, which transmits in the middle ear via three small bones -- the incus, the malleus, and the stapes -- to the cochlea and finally to the ''vestibular'' nerve, which carries the signal to our brain that interprets those nerve impulses as sound.''The inner ear is not involved with ''hearing''. It is composed of three semicircular canals, positioned at right angles to each other, that are lined with sensitive nerve cells, which act like a gyroscope for the body. This arrangement of the semicircular canals, in combination with the hair cells within the utricle and saccule and otoliths (tiny structures which trigger the hair cells in response to movement), make up the ''vestibular system''. This system provides instantaneous feedback to the brain, along with vision and proprioception receptors in the body, regarding our position in space.''Many children attempt to create a sense of vertigo by spinning or riding a merry-go-round or rollercoaster. This type of induced vertigo is self-limiting; it lasts for a few moments and then disappears. In comparison, when vertigo occurs spontaneously or as a result of an injury or illness, it may last for many hours or days before resolving.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of vertigo?,"'The symptoms of vertigo include a sense of spinning, loss of balance, whirling, or loss of balance. These symptoms can be present even when someone is perfectly still. Movement of the head or body, like rolling over in bed, can escalate or worsen the symptoms. Many people experience associated ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''.''While a patient may use the word ''dizziness'', it is important for a health care professional to understand whether the patient is describing a sensation of spinning (vertigo) or whether dizziness is describes another symptom like lightheadedness, ''fainting'', or nearly passing (''syncope'', near-syncope).'""Physical examination often shows signs of abnormal eye movements (called nystagmus). Health care professionals may try to reproduce the symptoms by abrupt movements of the patient's body or head, looking for nystagmus that can be produced by these maneuvers.""""It is important for the medical professional to determine whether inner ear problems or the cerebellum (the balance centers of the brain) is the cause of the vertigo. The patient may be asked to perform coordination tasks to make certain that the brain performs normally. Some tests might include reaching out to touch the examiner's index fingertip, sliding a heel up and down the opposite shin, or walking (to look for balance problems).""  "
What causes vertigo?,"'There are a number of different causes of vertigo. Vertigo can be defined based upon whether the cause is peripheral or central. Central causes of vertigo arise in the brain or spinal cord, while peripheral vertigo is due to a problem within the inner ear.''Peripheral causes:''Central causes:'

   The structures in the inner ear may become inflamed spontaneously. Small crystals or stones found normally within the inner ear can become displaced and cause irritation to the small hair cells within the semicircular canals, leading to vertigo. This is known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Infection of the vestibular nerve can cause dizziness, or vertigo. This is called vestibular neuronitis, vestibular neuritis, or labyrinthitis. Fluid buildup within the inner ear or the endolymphatic system causes Ménière's disease, vertigo that also includes hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ear). The cause of this fluid accumulation is unknown. Acoustic neuromas, tumors of the vestibular nerve, may also present with these three symptoms. Concussion or traumatic brain injury may be associated with vertigo. Strokes may cause vertigo and loss of coordination. Multiple sclerosis Tumors of the brain and spinal cord Some patients with a type of migraine headache called vestibular migraine may develop vertigo as a symptom."
What are the risk factors for vertigo?,"'Head injuries may increase the risk of developing vertigo. ''Ear infections'' may impact the vestibular nerve, leading to development of labyrinthitis. Vertigo may be a side effect of many medications, including some antiseizure medications, ''blood pressure'' medications, ''antidepressants'', and even ''aspirin''. For some people, drinking ''alcohol'' can cause vertigo.''The risk of ''stroke'' increases with poorly controlled ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', and ''smoking''. About 2%-3% of a population is at risk of developing BPPV; older women seem to have a slightly higher risk of developing this condition.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose vertigo?,"'During an evaluation for vertigo, the health care professional usually asks questions to take a history of the events and symptoms associated with vertigo. This includes medications taken (even ''over-the-counter'' medications), recent illnesses, and prior medical problems. Even seemingly unrelated problems may provide a clue as to the underlying cause of the vertigo.'""After getting the person's medical history, a medical professional then performs a physical examination. This often involves a full neurologic exam to evaluate brain function and determine whether the vertigo is due to a central or peripheral cause.""'Signs of nystagmus (abnormal eye movements) or incoordination can help pinpoint the underlying problem. A physician then performs the Dix-Hallpike test to try to reproduce vertigo. This test involves abruptly repositioning the patient\'s head and monitoring the symptoms that might be provoked. Not every patient is a good candidate for this type of assessment, and the provider might instead perform a ""roll test,"" during which a patient lies flat and the head is rapidly moved from side to side. Like the Dix-Hallpike test, this may reproduce vertigo symptoms and may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of the vertigo.''If the diagnosis of peripheral vertigo is uncertain, it may be necessary to consult a vestibular physical therapist to help make the diagnosis and also treat the patient at the same time.''Some cases of vertigo may require an ''MRI'' or ''CT scan'' of the brain and inner ears to exclude a structural problem like ''stroke'', ''multiple sclerosis'', or ''acoustic neuroma'', a non-''malignant tumor''. In rare cases, a small opening or fistula is identified between the perilymphatic space of the inner ear and the middle ear, leading to vertigo or other symptoms such as ''tinnitus'' or ''hearing loss''.''If hearing loss is suspected, audiometry (a hearing test) may be ordered. Hearing loss is not associated with BPPV or other common causes of vertigo. Electronystagmography, or electrical evaluation of vertigo, may help distinguish between peripheral and central vertigo but is not routinely performed.' "
What is the treatment for vertigo?,"'Some of the most effective treatments for peripheral vertigo include particle repositioning movements. The most well-known of these treatments is the Epley maneuver or canalith repositioning procedure. During this treatment, specific head movements lead to movement of the loose crystals (canaliths) within the inner ear. By repositioning these crystals, they cause less irritation to the inner ear and symptoms can resolve. Because these movements can initially lead to worsening of the vertigo, they should be done by an experienced health care professional or physical therapist.''Brandt-Daroff exercises can help alleviate symptoms of positional vertigo. This involves quickly lying flat from a seated position, initially with your head pointed away from the side that causes vertigo. This needs to be repeated multiple times daily for the best benefit. Other movements that have been identified as decreasing symptoms of vertigo or dizziness include the Semont maneuver and the Foster maneuver (half somersault).''Medications may provide some relief but are not recommended for long-term use. Medical professionals often prescribe ''meclizine'' for persistent vertigo symptoms and may be effective. ''Benzodiazepine'' medications like ''diazepam'' (''Valium'') are also effective but may cause significant drowsiness as a side effect. Other medications may be used to decrease ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. It is should be recognized that medications treat the symptoms but do not ""cure"" the vertigo.'""For individuals with Ménière's disease, a consistent low-salt (low-sodium) ""'diet'"" is often recommended. This helps to decrease some of the fluctuations of fluid within the vestibular system, diminishing some of the symptoms caused by Ménière's disease. ""'Betahistine'"" is a prescription medication that has been used since the 1970s as a treatment of Ménière's disease.""

Are home remedies effective for treating vertigo?,"'While several suggestions for treatment of vertigo can be found, most of these are ineffective. Many cases of vertigo resolve spontaneously within a few days, which may promote the belief that a certain home remedy has been beneficial in resolving the symptoms.''The vestibular rehabilitation exercises (Brand-Daroff exercises, along with the other exercises listed above) are meant to be done on a regular basis by patients and may lead to marked improvements in vertigo.'  "
Is it possible to prevent vertigo?,"'Most cases of vertigo occur spontaneously, and it is difficult to predict who is at risk. ''Prevention'' may not be possible. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle will decrease the risks of experiencing this condition.' Controlling risk factors for stroke may decrease the risk of developing central vertigo. This includes life control of high blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol along with avoiding tobacco products. To decrease symptoms of vertigo in cases of Ménière's disease, controlling salt intake may be helpful. If a medical professional diagnoses peripheral vertigo, then performing vestibular rehabilitation exercises routinely may help prevent recurrent episodes."
What is the prognosis for vertigo? How long does vertigo last?,"'Left untreated, most vertigo resolves spontaneously in a few days.''Most patients with peripheral vertigo can find substantial relief with treatment. The Epley maneuver is successful 90% of the time for cases of BPPV. There may be a recurrence rate of up to 15% in the first year after an episode.''When vertigo persists, evaluation for any underlying structural problems of the brain, spinal canal, or inner ear may be necessary.' "
What is a balance disorder?,"'A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady or \tdizzy, \tas if you are moving, spinning, or floating, even though you are standing \tstill or lying down. ''Balance disorders'' can be caused by certain health \tconditions, medications, or a problem in the inner ear or the brain.''Our sense of balance is primarily controlled by a maze-like structure in \tour inner ear called the ''labyrinth'', which is made of bone and soft tissue. \tAt one end of the ''labyrinth'' is an intricate system of loops and pouches \tcalled the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs, which help us \tmaintain our balance. At the other end is a snail-shaped organ called the \tcochlea, which enables us to hear. The medical term for all of the parts of \tthe inner ear involved with balance is the ''vestibular system''.' "
How does the vestibular system work?,"'Our ''vestibular'' system works with other sensorimotor systems in the body, \tsuch as our visual system (eyes) and skeletal system (bones and joints), to \tcheck and maintain the position of our body at rest or in motion. It also \thelps us maintain a steady focus on objects even though the position of our \tbody changes. The ''vestibular system'' does this by detecting mechanical \tforces, including gravity, that act upon our ''vestibular'' organs when we move. \tTwo sections of the labyrinth help us accomplish these tasks: the \tsemicircular canals and the otolithic organs.''The semicircular canals are three fluid-filled loops arranged roughly at \tright angles to each other. They tell the brain when our head moves in a \trotating or circular way, such as when we nod our head up and down or look \tfrom right to left.''Each semicircular canal has a plump base, which contains a \traindrop-shaped structure filled with a gel-like substance. \tThis structure, called the cupula, sits on top of a cluster of sensory \tcells, called hair cells. The hair cells have long threadlike extensions, \tcalled stereocilia, that extend into the gel. When the head moves, fluid \tinside the semicircular canal moves. This motion causes the cupula to bend \tand the stereocilia within it to tilt to one side. The tilting action \tcreates a signal that travels to the brain to tell it the movement and \tposition of your head.''Between the semicircular canals and the cochlea lie the otolithic organs, \twhich are two fluid-filled pouches called the utricle and the saccule. These \torgans tell the brain when our body is moving in a straight line, such as \twhen we stand up or ride in a car or on a bike. They also tell the brain the \tposition of our head with respect to gravity, such as whether we are sitting \tup, leaning back, or lying down.''Like the semicircular canals, the utricle and the saccule have sensory \thair cells. These hair cells line the bottom of each pouch, and their \tstereocilia extend into an overlying gel-like layer. On top of the gel are \ttiny grains made of \t''calcium carbonate'"" called otoconia. When you tilt your \thead, gravity pulls on the grains, which then move the stereocilia. As with \tthe semicircular canals, this movement creates a signal that tells the brain \tthe head's position.""'Our visual system works with our vestibular system to keep objects from \tblurring when our head moves and to keep us aware of our position when we \twalk or when we ride in a vehicle. Sensory receptors in our joints and \tmuscles also help us maintain our balance when we stand still or walk. The \tbrain receives, interprets, and processes the information from these systems \tto control our balance.''Figure 1.'' Diagram of outer, middle, and inner ear. The ''outer ear'' is labeledin the figure and includes the ear canal. The ''middle ear'' includes the eardrum(tympanic membrane) and three tiny bones for ''hearing''. The bones are called thehammer (malleus), anvil (incus), and stirrup (stapes) to reflect their shapes.The middle ear connects to the back of the throat by the Eustachian tube. Theinner ear (labyrinth) contains the semicircular canals and vestibule forbalance, and the cochlea for ''hearing''.''The vestibular structures of the inner ear are the vestibule (which is madeup of the utricle and saccule) and the three semicircular canals. Thesestructures work somewhat like a carpenter\'s level (a tool used to show how ""level""a horizontal or vertical surface is). That is, they work by way of thevestibulocochlear nerve with the vestibular center in the brain to deal withbody balance and position. (The rest of the inner ear, that is, the cochlea, isconcerned with hearing.) Thus, the vestibular '' system'' includes the vestibule, thesemicircular canals, the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve, andthe vestibular center in the brain.''The vestibular system measures linear and rotational movement. A number ofdisorders can cause this system to stop working or provide inappropriateinformation. These disorders include Ménière syndrome, ''labyrinthitis'', benignparoxysmal positional ''vertigo'', ''ear infections'', tumors, or ''trauma''. Each of theseconditions is discussed below.' "
What are the symptoms of a balance disorder?,"'If your balance is impaired, you may feel as if the room is spinning. You \tmay stagger when you try to walk or teeter or fall when you try to stand up. \tSome of the symptoms you might experience are:''Other symptoms are ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', changes in ''heart'' rate \tand ''blood pressure'', and fear, ''anxiety'', or \tpanic.

		vertigo (a spinning sensation) Falling or feeling as if you are going to fall Lightheadedness, faintness, or a floating sensation Blurred vision Confusion or disorientation"
What causes a balance disorder?,"'A balance disorder may be caused by viral or ''bacterial infections'' in the \tear, a ''head injury'', or blood circulation disorders that affect the inner ear \tor brain. Many people experience problems with their sense of balance as \tthey get older. Balance problems and ''dizziness'' also can result from taking \tcertain medications.''In addition, problems in the visual and skeletal systems and the nervous \tand circulatory systems can be the source of some posture and balance \tproblems. A circulatory system disorder, such as ''low blood pressure'', can \tlead to a feeling of ''dizziness'' when we suddenly stand up. Problems in the \tskeletal or visual systems, such as ''arthritis'' or eye muscle imbalance, also \tmay cause balance problems. However, many ''balance disorders'' can begin all of \ta sudden and with no obvious cause.' "
What are some types of balance disorders?,"'There are more than a dozen different ''balance disorders''. Some of the most \tcommon are:''Benign paroxysmal positional ''vertigo'' (BPPV)'' or positional ''vertigo'' is a \tbrief, intense episode of ''vertigo'"" that occurs because of a specific change \tin the position of the head. If you have BPPV, you might feel as if you're \tspinning when you look for an object on a high or low shelf or turn your \thead to look over your shoulder (such as when you back up your car). You \talso may experience BPPV when you roll over in bed. BPPV is caused when \totoconia tumble from the utricle into one of the semicircular canals and \tweigh on the cupula. The cupula can't tilt properly and sends conflicting \tmessages to the brain about the position of the head, causing ""'vertigo''.

How is a balance disorder diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of a balance disorder is difficult. There are many potential \tcauses - including medical conditions and medications.''To help evaluate a balance problem, your doctor may suggest you see an \totolaryngologist. An otolaryngologist is a physician and surgeon who \tspecializes in the ear, nose, and throat. An otolaryngologist may request \ttests to assess the cause and extent of the balance problem depending on \tyour symptoms and health status.''The otolaryngologist may request a hearing examination, blood tests, an \telectronystagmogram (which measures eye movements and the muscles that \tcontrol them), or imaging studies of your head and brain. Another possible \ttest is called posturography. For this test, you stand on a special movable \tplatform in front of a patterned screen. The doctor measures how your body \tmoves in response to movement of the platform, the patterned screen, or \tboth.' "
How is a balance disorder treated?,"'The first thing a doctor will do to treat a balance disorder is determine \tif your dizziness is caused by a medical condition or medication. If it is, \tyour doctor will treat the condition or suggest a different medication.''Your doctor also may describe ways for you to handle daily activities \tthat increase the risk of falling and injury, such as driving, ''walking'' up or \tdown stairs, and using the bathroom. If you have BPPV, your doctor might \tprescribe a series of simple movements, called the Epley maneuver, to help \tdislodge the otoconia from the semicircular canal. You begin the Epley \tmaneuver by sitting upright, with the help of a trained therapist, then \tquickly lie down on your back, turn your head to one side, and wait for a \tminute or two before sitting back up again (see Figure 3). For some people, \tone session will be all that is needed. Others might need to repeat the \tprocedure several times at home to relieve their dizziness.'""If you are diagnosed with Ménière's disease, your doctor may recommend \tchanges in your ""'diet'', such as reducing the use of salt in your food and \tlimiting ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine''. Not ''smoking'' also may help. Some anti-vertigo \tor ''anti-nausea'' medications may relieve your symptoms, but they can also make \tyou drowsy. Other medications, such as the antibiotic gentamicin or \t''corticosteroids'', may be injected behind the eardrum to reach the inner ear. \tAlthough gentamicin helps reduce dizziness, it occasionally destroys sensory \tcells in the cochlea and causes permanent ''hearing loss''. The risk of hearing \tloss can be lowered if small doses of gentamicin are given off and on until \tyour symptoms decrease. ''Corticosteroids'"" don't cause ""'hearing loss'""; however, \tresearch is underway to determine if they are as effective as gentamicin. \tSurgery on the vestibular organ may be necessary if you have a severe case \tof Ménière's disease.""'Some people with a balance disorder may not be able to fully relieve \ttheir dizziness and will have to develop ways to cope with it on a daily \tbasis. A vestibular rehabilitation therapist can help by developing an \tindividualized treatment plan that combines head, body, and eye exercises to \tdecrease dizziness and ''nausea''.'""To reduce your risk of injury from dizziness, avoid walking in the dark. \tYou also should wear low-heeled shoes or walking shoes outdoors and use a \tcane or walker if necessary. If you have handrails in the home, inspect them \tperiodically to make sure they are safe and secure. Modifications to \tbathroom fixtures can make them safer. Conditions at work may need to be \tmodified or restricted, at least temporarily. Driving a car may be \tespecially hazardous. Ask your doctor's opinion about whether it's safe for \tyou to drive.""

What research is being done for balance disorders?,"'BPPV is the most common balance disorder. Because the source of the \tproblem—displaced otoconia—is located deep within the ear, doctors have had \tto rely mainly on observation and a medical history to make a diagnosis. \tResearchers supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other \tCommunication Disorders (NIDCD) now have created a head-mounted apparatus \tthat uses 3-D animation to map the location of otoconia in the inner ear. \tThe apparatus is built around a pair of infrared video goggles that gather \tdata from eye and head movements and then sends it to a computer program for \tmapping. A second computer program uses the data to develop a step-by-step \tguide for repositioning maneuvers to dislodge the otoconia from the \tsemicircular canals. If shown to be effective in ''clinical trials'', the \tapparatus and its software programs will help doctors more accurately \tdiagnose BPPV and guide repositioning maneuvers to ensure the best possible \ttreatment. ''Other NIDCD-supported scientists are looking at the molecular mechanisms \tthat regulate the development of the inner ear. One research team has \tidentified a gene that encodes a protein that helps in the formation of the \tsemicircular canals and their related sensory tissue. Another team has \tidentified a family of genes, called the otopetrins, which help form \totoconia in mice. Findings from the mouse study could help researchers \tdetermine if otoconia destroyed by ''aging'', medications, infections, or ''trauma'' \tcan someday be regenerated in humans with balance problems.''NIDCD-supported scientists also are experimenting with several types of \tvestibular prostheses, or replacement parts, in balance-impaired animals. \tResearchers hope these devices will one day be used to compensate for \tvestibular system loss in people.'""One prosthesis uses a head-mounted motion sensor to mimic the ear and \tbrain's natural signaling system. The sensor measures the head's rotation \tand sends the information to a microprocessor. The microprocessor then \tconverts the signals into electrical impulses and sends them to an electrode \timplanted in the ear. The electrode stimulates the vestibular nerve, \tcreating a signal that helps the brain move the eyes to compensate for the \thead's rotation.""'A second prosthesis is designed to simulate the movement of fluid within \tthe semicircular canal. In a normal ear, fluid changes help the brain \tunderstand the movement and position of the head. The device combines \tmicrocontroller circuitry with a tiny mechanical device that increases \tnormal fluid movement to provide a stronger vestibular signal to the brain.''Researchers also are studying the effectiveness of different types of \trehabilitative exercises as a treatment option for ''balance disorders''. In one \tNIDCD-funded study, researchers have used virtual reality technology to \tsimulate the aisles of a grocery store. Using a real cart attached to a \tcustom-built treadmill in front of a projection screen, patients “walk” down \taisles, scanning virtual store shelves for items on their list. Researchers \tare testing whether practicing in the virtual store will lessen episodes of \tdizziness in the real world, especially in visually complex environments.' "
What are Vibrio bacteria?,'Vibrio'' bacteria naturally live in certain coastal waters and are present in higher concentrations between May and October when water temperatures are warmer.' 
What is vibriosis?,"'About a dozen ''Vibrio'' species can cause human illness, known as vibriosis. The most common species causing human illness in the United States are ''Vibrio parahaemolyticus'', ''Vibrio vulnificus'', and ''Vibrio alginolyticus''.' "
How do people get vibrosis?,"'Most people become infected by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. Certain ''Vibrio'' species can also cause a ''skin infection'' when an ''open wound'' is exposed to brackish or salt water. Brackish water is a mixture of fresh and sea water. It is often found where rivers meet the sea.' "
Who is more likely to get vibriosis?,"'People with compromised immune systems, especially those with chronic ''liver disease'"", are more likely to get vibriosis. Eating raw seafood, particularly oysters, and exposing open wounds to brackish or salt water can increase a person's chance for getting vibriosis."" "
During which months are people more likely to get vibriosis?,'About 80% of infections occur between May and October when water temperatures are warmer.' 
How common is vibriosis?,"'CDC estimates that vibriosis causes 80,000 illnesses each year in the United States. About 52,000 of these illnesses are estimated to be the result of eating contaminated food.''The most commonly reported species, ''Vibrio parahaemolyticus'', is estimated to cause 45,000 illnesses each year in the United States.' "
Is vibriosis a serious disease?,"'Most people with a mild case of vibriosis recover after about 3 days with no lasting effects. However, people with a ''Vibrio vulnificus'' infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 4 people with this type of infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.' "
Symptoms,"'When ingested, ''Vibrio'' bacteria can cause watery ''diarrhea'', often accompanied by abdominal cramping, ''nausea'', vomiting, ''fever'', and chills. Usually these symptoms occur within 24 hours of ingestion and last about 3 days. Severe illness is rare and typically occurs in people with a weakened immune system.''Vibrio'' bacteria can also cause a skin infection when an open wound is exposed to brackish or salt water. Brackish water is a mixture of fresh and sea water. It is often found where rivers meet the sea.'  "
Diagnosis,"'A clinician may suspect vibriosis if a patient has watery diarrhea and has recently eaten raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters, or when a wound infection occurs after exposure to seawater. Infection is diagnosed when ''Vibrio'' bacteria are found in the ''stool'', wound, or blood of a patient who has symptoms of vibriosis.' "
Treatment,"'Treatment is not necessary in mild cases, but patients should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluids lost through diarrhea. Although there is no evidence that antibiotics decrease the severity or duration of illness, they are sometimes used in severe or prolonged illnesses.' "
How can vibriosis be prevented?,"""To reduce your chance of getting vibriosis, don't eat raw or undercooked shellfish, such as oysters. If you have a wound (including ""'cuts'' and ''scrapes'""), avoid contact with brackish or salt water or cover the wound with a waterproof bandage if there's a possibility it could come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices."" "
How does CDC monitor vibriosis?,"'Vibriosis has been a nationally notifiable disease since 2007.''Health departments report cases to the Cholera and Other ''Vibrio'' Illness Surveillance (COVIS) system. COVIS was initiated by CDC, FDA, and four Gulf Coast states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas) in 1989. By the early 2000s, almost all states were voluntarily reporting.''Because ''Vibrio'' bacteria are not easily identified with routine testing, many cases are not reported.' "
What is video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)?,"'A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)'' is a minimally invasive thoracic surgery that does not use a traditional open surgery approach. VATS provides adequate visualization despite limited access to the thorax.\xa0''The operating time and postoperative recovery time in VATS is shorter than those in open surgery. The postoperative morbidity rates in VATS are lower than those in open surgery, and the patients can resume normal activities sooner than in open surgery. VATS can also be performed as a diagnostic procedure to study the thorax.''VATS is principally used in the management of pulmonary, mediastinal, and pleural pathology. Its main benefit is the avoidance of a thoracotomy incision, which allows a shorter operating time, less postoperative morbidity, and earlier return to normal activity, compared with what can be achieved with a thoracotomy.''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called the bronchus (bronchi). The bronchi open into the ''lungs'' and branch out into smaller tubes called the ''bronchioles''. The end of bronchioles opens into little air sacs called the alveoli that aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by the blood vessels, through which the exchange of gases, oxygen, and carbon dioxide takes place.''The mediastinum is an area present in the midline of the thoracic ''cavity'' (chest ''cavity''), which is surrounded by the left and right pleural sacs. The pleura is a thin membrane that lines the outer surface of the lungs (visceral pleura) and the inner surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura). The space between these two pleurae is called the pleural space. The pleural space is less than 1 mm thick and is filled with the pleural fluid.\xa0''When the pleural space is affected by pathologic disorders, it can lead to medical consequences. One of the complications is fibrothorax, which is an abnormal accumulation of fibrous tissues (''scar tissue'') over the visceral pleura. The deposition of fibrous tissues over the lungs can be so intense that the layers of the pleural space fuse, preventing the lungs to expand adequately. Over time, the lungs become entrapped, and ''breathing'' becomes difficult.' "
Why is video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) done?,"'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is used in both diagnostic and therapeutic pleural, pulmonary (lung), and mediastinal surgery. Some common indications for VATS include the following:' Lung, mediastinal, and pleural biopsies Lobectomy (removal of part of the lungs) Resection of the lung nodule Evaluation of mediastinal tumors or adenopathy Bullectomy: It is the surgical removal of a bulla. Bulla or bullae is a pathological condition in the lungs that is usually caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Treatment of recurrent pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity) Management of empyema (pus in the pleura) Repair of a broncho-pleural fistula (an abnormal connection between the bronchus and pleura) Chest trauma  Pericardial window (a procedure done on the sac surrounding the heart)"
When is video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) not done?,'Absolute contraindications include the following:''Relative contraindications include the following:' Markedly unstable or anxious patient Extensive adhesions of the pleural space Prior pleural procedures Inability to tolerate the procedure Previous procedures of the thorax Extensive pleural diseases Bleeding disorders Prior radiation treatment for thoracic cancers
How is video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) performed?,"'Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is performed under anesthesia. One to four small incisions (the largest being 4 cm) are used in VATS procedures. A 5- or 10-mm video thoracoscope (a camera with a light source) of various angles and surgical instruments are introduced into the incisions. For diagnostic procedures or simple procedures such as drainage of pleural effusions, a single effusion is usually sufficient.\xa0' "
What are the complications of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)?,'Complications may include the following:' Persistent air leak Bleeding Infection Damage to the nerves and other structures  Reaction to anesthesia  Tumor implantation following a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) (transfer of tumor cells to other unaffected areas)
What are video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation?,"'Tracheal ''intubation'','' also called intubation, involves placing a flexible ''plastic'' tube (endotracheal [ET] tube) into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open ''airway'', ventilate the ''lungs'', or administer certain ''drugs''. Video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic laryngoscope aid in tracheal intubation.''Video laryngoscopy'' is a form of indirect laryngoscopy in which the physician does not directly inspect the larynx. Instead, the larynx is visualized with a fiberoptic or digital laryngoscope (a camera with a light source) inserted transnasally (through the nose) or transorally (through the mouth).''Images and videos captured during video laryngoscopy can be displayed on a monitor for clinicians, patients, and others to view at the time of the procedure. It can also be recorded so it can be viewed at a later time. The images and video also help monitor disease progression and treatment. The images are magnified when displayed on the monitor, which helps in the detailed examination of the larynx. Video laryngoscopy forms the basis of fiberoptic intubation.''Fiberoptic intubation'' involves inserting an ET tube over the shaft of a flexible fiberoptic scope for visualization. Video laryngoscopy is also used with rigid transoral laryngoscopy. There are various variations to a rigid laryngoscope. The rigid laryngoscope can also be connected to a camera and monitor.\xa0' "
When is video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation done?,"'Tracheal intubation is indicated as a medical procedure in various medical conditions that prevent a person from maintaining a clear airway, ''breathing'', and oxygenating the blood. It is indicated in the following conditions:''Indication for fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation:''Patients with the following conditions or in the following categories are likely to have a difficult airway:' Inability to maintain an open airway Inability to protect the airway against aspiration Failure to ventilate Failure to oxygenate Lung and cardiac failure Provide general anesthesia, maintain the airway, and provide ventilation during surgery  Any patient who meets the criteria for intubation can be intubated fiberoptically. However, because of equipment involved, most doctors use fiberoptic intubation for patients who have a difficult airway. Micrognathia (much smaller or shorter lower jaw than the rest of the face) Mandibular (jaw) fracture Partially obstructing laryngeal lesions such as tumors  Cervical (neck) spine injuries or cervical instability Rheumatoid arthritis or patients who are unable to extend the neck due to other conditions  A history of head and neck radiation therapy  Trismus (lockjaw) Craniofacial abnormalities (birth defects of the face and head)"
When is fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation not done?,'Fiberoptic intubation is contraindicated in patients' Who need a surgical airway (those with highly obstructing laryngeal lesions such as large tumors) With laryngeal trauma With craniofacial trauma who are actively bleeding into the oral cavity and throat
How are video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation performed?,"'The procedure can be performed with the patient either awake or sedated.\xa0''If the patient has a difficult airway, the procedure may be performed when they are awake using fiberoptic-assisted intubation. This is called awake intubation.\xa0''In some circumstances, if the patient is anxious and unable to tolerate the procedure, they may be given mild intravenous sedation. For the awake patient, the procedure may be done with the patient seated or lying down, and local anesthesia would be provided to the nose and throat.' Nasal intubation with general anesthesia: The technique of intubating nasally with the patient under general anesthesia is similar to that of awake intubation. After general anesthesia is induced, the patient is mask-ventilated in the supine position. Oral intubation with sedation: Oral intubation is usually performed with the patient sedated. The patient may also be sedated and kept spontaneously breathing. An oral airway often makes this easier and lifts the tongue off the posterior pharyngeal wall, facilitating exposure of the larynx. In oral intubation, the tongue can be grasped and lifted, providing better exposure, and hence, it is preferred.   Rigid video laryngoscopy: Several rigid laryngoscopes may be used for video laryngoscopy. The laryngoscope is attached to a camera and light source. Rigid laryngoscopy is usually performed under sedation."
What are the complications of video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic-assisted tracheal intubation?," Equipment malfunction Trauma to the structures in the throat, vocal cords, trachea, or esophagus (food pipe) Spasm of the larynx"
What are viral hemorrhagic fevers?,"'Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body\'s ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. While some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life-threatening disease.''The Special Pathogens Branch (SPB) primarily works with hemorrhagic fever viruses that are classified as biosafety level four (BSL-4) pathogens. A list of these viruses appears in the ''SPB disease information index''. The Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, also in the National Center for Infectious Diseases, works with the non-BSL-4 viruses that cause two other hemorrhagic fevers, dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever.' "
How are hemorrhagic fever viruses grouped?,"'VHFs are caused by viruses of four distinct families: arenaviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses. Each of these families share a number of features:''In rare cases, other viral and ''bacterial infections'' can cause a hemorrhagic fever; scrub ''typhus'' is a good example.' They are all RNA viruses, and all are covered, or enveloped, in a fatty (lipid) coating. Their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host, called the natural reservoir. The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after the accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another. Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted. With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs."
What carries viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fevers?,"'Viruses associated with most VHFs are zoonotic. This means that these viruses naturally reside in an animal reservoir host or arthropod vector. They are totally dependent on their hosts for replication and overall survival. For the most part, rodents and arthropods are the main reservoirs for viruses causing VHFs. The multimammate rat, cotton rat, deer mouse, house mouse, and other field rodents are examples of reservoir hosts. Arthropod ''ticks'' and mosquitoes serve as vectors for some of the illnesses. However, the hosts of some viruses remain unknown -- Ebola and Marburg viruses are well-known examples.' "
Where are cases of viral hemorrhagic fever found?,"'Taken together, the viruses that cause VHFs are distributed over much of the globe. However, because each virus is associated with one or more particular host species, the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen only where the host species live(s). Some hosts, such as the rodent species carrying several of the New World arenaviruses, live in geographically restricted areas. Therefore, the risk of getting VHFs caused by these viruses is restricted to those areas. Other hosts range over continents, such as the rodents that carry viruses which cause various forms of ''hantavirus'' pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North and South America, or the different set of rodents that carry viruses which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia. A few hosts are distributed nearly worldwide, such as the common rat. It can carry Seoul virus, a cause of HFRS; therefore, humans can get HFRS anywhere where the common rat is found.''While people usually become infected only in areas where the host lives, occasionally people become infected by a host that has been exported from its native habitat. For example, the first outbreaks of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Yugoslavia, occurred when laboratory workers handled imported monkeys infected with ''Marburg virus''. Occasionally, a person becomes infected in an area where the virus occurs naturally and then travels elsewhere. If the virus is a type that can be transmitted further by person-to-person contact, the ''traveler'' could infect other people. For instance, in 1996, a medical professional treating patients with ''Ebola hemorrhagic fever'' (Ebola HF) in Gabon unknowingly became infected. When he later traveled to South Africa and was treated for Ebola HF in a hospital, the virus was transmitted to a nurse. She became ill and died. Because more and more people travel each year, outbreaks of these diseases are becoming an increasing threat in places where they rarely, if ever, have been seen before.' "
How are hemorrhagic fever viruses transmitted?,"'Viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents. The viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human, or when a human crushes a tick. However, some of these vectors may spread virus to animals, livestock, for example. Humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals.''Some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another, once an initial person has become infected. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. This type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly, through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. It can also occur indirectly, through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. For example, contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever.' "
What are the symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever illnesses?,"'Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears. However, although they may bleed from many sites around the body, patients rarely die because of blood loss. Severely ill patient cases may also show shock, nervous system malfunction, ''coma'', delirium, and ''seizures''. Some types of VHF are associated with renal (kidney) failure.' "
How are patients with viral hemorrhagic fever treated?,"'Patients receive supportive therapy, but generally speaking, there is no other treatment or established cure for VHFs. Ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, has been effective in treating some individuals with Lassa fever or HFRS. Treatment with convalescent-phase plasma has been used with success in some patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever.' "
How can cases of viral hemorrhagic fever be prevented and controlled?,"'With the exception of yellow fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, for which ''vaccines'' have been developed, no ''vaccines'' exist that can protect against these diseases. Therefore, prevention efforts must concentrate on avoiding contact with host species. If prevention methods fail and a case of VHF does occur, efforts should focus on preventing further transmission from person to person, if the virus can be transmitted in this way. Because many of the hosts that carry hemorrhagic fever viruses are rodents, ''disease prevention'' efforts include:''For hemorrhagic fever viruses spread by arthropod vectors, prevention efforts often focus on community-wide insect and arthropod control. In addition, people are encouraged to use insect repellant, proper clothing, bednets, window screens, and other insect barriers to avoid being bitten.''For those hemorrhagic fever viruses that can be transmitted from one person to another, avoiding close physical contact with infected people and their body fluids is the most important way of controlling the spread of disease. Barrier ''nursing'' or infection control techniques include isolating infected individuals and wearing protective clothing. Other infection control recommendations include proper use, disinfection, and disposal of instruments and equipment used in treating or caring for patients with VHF, such as needles and thermometers.''In conjunction with the World Health Organization, CDC has developed practical, hospital-based guidelines, ''Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers In the African Health Care Setting''. The manual can help health-care facilities recognize cases and prevent further hospital-based disease transmission using locally available materials and few financial resources.' controlling rodent populations; discouraging rodents from entering or living in homes or workplaces; encouraging safe cleanup of rodent nests and droppings."
What needs to be done to address the threat of viral hemorrhagic fevers?,"'Scientists and researchers are challenged with developing containment, treatment, and vaccine strategies for these diseases. Another goal is to develop immunologic and molecular tools for more rapid disease diagnosis, and to study how the viruses are transmitted and exactly how the disease affects the body (pathogenesis). A third goal is to understand the ecology of these viruses and their hosts in order to offer preventive public health advice for avoiding infection.' "
Viral hepatitis definition and overview,"'Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Many illnesses and conditions can cause inflammation of the liver, for example, ''drugs'', ''alcohol'', chemicals, and autoimmune diseases. Many viruses, for example, the virus causing\xa0''mononucleosis'' and the ''cytomegalovirus'', can inflame the liver. Most viruses, however, do not attack primarily the liver; the liver is just one of several organs that the viruses affect. When most doctors speak of viral hepatitis, they are using the definition that means hepatitis caused by a few specific viruses that primarily attack the liver and are responsible for about half of all human hepatitis. There are several hepatitis viruses; they have been named types A, B, C, D, E, F (not confirmed), and G. As our knowledge of hepatitis viruses grows, it is likely that this alphabetical list will become longer. The most common hepatitis viruses are types A, B, and C. Reference to the hepatitis viruses often occurs in an abbreviated form (for example, HAV, ''HBV'', ''HCV'' represent hepatitis viruses A, B, and C, respectively.) The focus of this article is on these viruses that cause the majority of human viral hepatitis.''Hepatitis viruses replicate (multiply) primarily in the liver cells. This can cause the liver to be unable to perform its functions. The following is a list of major functions of the liver:''When the liver is inflamed, it does not perform these functions well, which brings about many of the symptoms, signs, and problems associated with any type of hepatitis. Each hepatitis viral type (A-F) has both articles and books describing the details of infection with that specific virus. This article is designed to give the reader an overview of the predominant viruses that cause viral hepatitis, their symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments, and should help the reader choose the subject(s) for more in-depth information.' The liver helps purify the blood by changing harmful chemicals into harmless ones. The source of these chemicals can be external, such as medications or alcohol, or internal, such as ammonia or bilirubin. Typically, these harmful chemicals are broken down into smaller chemicals or attached to other chemicals that then are eliminated from the body in the urine or stool. The liver produces many important substances, especially proteins that are necessary for good health. For example, it produces albumin, the protein building block of the body, as well as the proteins that cause blood to clot properly. The liver stores many sugars, fats and vitamins until they are needed elsewhere in the body. The liver builds smaller chemicals into larger, more complicated chemicals that are needed elsewhere in the body. Examples of this type of function are the manufacture of a fat, cholesterol, and the protein bilirubin."
What are the common types of viral hepatitis?,"'Although the most common types of viral hepatitis are HAV, HBV, and HCV, some clinicians had previously considered the acute and chronic phases of hepatic infections as ""types"" of viral hepatitis. HAV was considered to be acute viral hepatitis because the HAV infections seldom caused permanent liver damage that led to hepatic (liver) failure. HBV and HCV produced chronic viral hepatitis. However, these terms are outdated and not currently used as frequently because all of the viruses that cause hepatitis may have acute phase symptoms (see symptoms below). ''Prevention'' techniques and ''vaccinations'' have markedly reduced the current incidence of common viral hepatitis infections; however, there remains a population of about 1 to 2 million people in the U.S. with chronic HBV, and about 3.5 million with chronic HCV according to the CDC. Statistics are incomplete for determining how many new infections occur each year; the CDC documented infections but then goes on to estimate the actual numbers by further estimating the number of unreported infections (see the following sections and reference 1).''In 2016, there were 2,007 new HAV cases reported to the CDC. Hepatitis caused by HAV is an acute illness (acute viral hepatitis) that never becomes chronic. At one time, ''hepatitis A'' was referred to as ""infectious hepatitis"" because it could be spread easily from person to person like other viral infections. Infection with hepatitis A virus can be spread through the ingestion of food or water, especially where unsanitary conditions allow water or food to become contaminated by human waste containing hepatitis A (the fecal-oral mode of transmission). Hepatitis A typically is spread among household members and close contacts through the passage of oral secretions (intimate kissing) or ''stool'' (poor hand washing). It also is common to have infection spread to customers in ''restaurants'' and among children and workers in daycare centers if hand washing and sanitary precautions are not observed.''There were 3,218 new cases of HBV infection estimated by the CDC in 2016 and more than 1,698 people died due to the consequences of chronic ''hepatitis B'' infection in the United States according to the CDC. HBV hepatitis was at one time referred to as ""serum hepatitis,"" because it was thought that the only way HBV could spread was through blood or serum (the liquid portion of blood) containing the virus. It is now known that HBV can spread by sexual contact, the transfer of blood or serum through shared needles in drug abusers, accidental needle sticks with needles contaminated with infected blood, blood transfusions, ''hemodialysis'', and by infected mothers to their newborns. The infection also can be spread by tattooing, body piercing, and sharing razors and toothbrushes (if there is contamination with infected blood). About 5% to 10% of patients with HBV hepatitis develop chronic HBV infection (infection lasting at least six months and often years to decades) and can infect others as long as they remain infected. Patients with chronic HBV infection also are at risk of developing ''cirrhosis'', liver failure, and liver ''cancer''. It is estimated that there are 2.2 million people in the U.S. and 2 billion people worldwide who suffer from chronic HBV infections.''The CDC reported that there were 2,967 reported new cases of ''hepatitis C''\xa0in 2016. The CDC reports that the actual number of acute cases is estimated to be 13.9 times the number of reported cases in any year, thus, it is estimated that there were actually 41,200 acute ''hepatitis C'' cases occurring in 2016. HCV hepatitis was previously referred to as ""non-A, non-B hepatitis,"" because the causative virus had not been identified, but it was known to be neither HAV nor HBV. HCV usually is spread by shared needles among drug abusers, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and needle sticks. Approximately 75%-90% of transfusion-associated hepatitis is caused by HCV. Transmission of the virus by sexual contact has been reported but is considered rare. An estimated 75% to 85% of patients with acute HCV infection develop chronic infection. Patients with chronic HCV infection can continue to infect others. Patients with chronic HCV infection are at risk for developing cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver ''cancer''. It is estimated that there are about 3.5 million people with chronic HCV infection in the U.S.''There also are viral hepatitis types D, E, and G. The most important of these at present is the hepatitis D virus (HDV), also known as the delta virus or agent. It is a small virus that requires concomitant infection with HBV to survive. HDV cannot survive on its own because it requires a protein that the HBV makes (the envelope protein, also called surface antigen) to enable it to infect liver cells. The ways in which HDV is spread are by shared needles among drug abusers, contaminated blood, and by sexual contact; essentially the same ways as HBV.''Individuals who already have chronic HBV infection can acquire HDV infection at the same time as they acquire the HBV infection, or at a later time. Those with chronic hepatitis due to HBV and HDV develop cirrhosis (severe liver scarring) rapidly. Moreover, the combination of HDV and HBV virus infection is very difficult to treat.''Hepatitis E'' virus (HEV) is similar to HAV in terms of disease and mainly occurs in Asia where it is transmitted by contaminated water.''Hepatitis G'' virus (HGV, also termed GBV-C) was recently discovered and resembles HCV, but more closely, the flaviviruses. The virus and its effects are under investigation, and its role in causing disease in humans is unclear.' "
Who is at risk for viral hepatitis?,"'People who are most at risk for developing viral hepatitis are:''Blood transfusion, once a common means of spreading viral hepatitis, now is a rare cause of hepatitis. Viral hepatitis is generally thought to be as much as 10 times more common among lower socioeconomic and poorly educated individuals. About one-third of all cases of hepatitis comes from an unknown or unidentifiable source. This means that a person does not have to be in a high-risk group in order to be infected with a hepatitis virus. In countries with poor sanitation, food, and water contamination with HAV increases risk. Some daycare centers may become contaminated with HAV, so children at such centers are at a higher risk for HAV infections.' Workers in the health care professions Asians and Pacific Islanders Sewage and water treatment workers People with multiple sexual partners Intravenous drug users HIV patients People with hemophilia who receive blood clotting factors"
What are the symptoms and signs of viral hepatitis?,"'The period of time between exposure to hepatitis and the onset of the illness is called the incubation period. The incubation period varies depending on the specific hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of about 15 to 45 days; ''Hepatitis B'' virus from 45 to 160 days, and ''Hepatitis C'' virus from about 2 weeks to 6 months.''Many patients infected with HAV, HBV, and HCV have few or no symptoms of illness. For those who do develop symptoms of viral hepatitis, the most common are ''flu-like'' symptoms including:''Less common symptoms include:'   Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Fever Weakness Tiredness Aching in the abdomen Dark urine Light-colored stools Fever Jaundice (a yellow appearance to the skin and white portion of the eyes)"
What is acute fulminant hepatitis?,"'Rarely, individuals with acute infections with HAV and HBV develop severe inflammation, and the liver fails (acute fulminant hepatitis). These patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis already described and the additional problems of ''confusion'' or ''coma'"" (due to the liver's failure to detoxify chemicals), as well as ""'bruising'' or bleeding (due to a lack of blood clotting factors). In fact, up to 80% of people with acute fulminant hepatitis can die within days to weeks; therefore, it is fortunate that acute fulminant hepatitis is rare. For example, less than 0.5% of adults with acute infection with HBV will develop acute fulminant hepatitis. This is even less common with HCV alone, although it becomes more frequent when both HBV and HCV are present together.' "
What is chronic viral hepatitis?,"""Patients infected with HBV and HCV can develop chronic hepatitis. Doctors define chronic hepatitis as hepatitis that lasts longer than 6 months. In chronic hepatitis, the viruses live and multiply in the liver for years or decades. For unknown reasons, these patients' immune systems are unable to eradicate the viruses, and the viruses cause chronic inflammation of the liver. Chronic hepatitis can lead to the development over time of extensive liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver ""'cancer''. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C infection is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the U.S. Patients with chronic viral hepatitis can transmit the infection to others with blood or body fluids (for example, sharing needles, sexually, and infrequently by organ donation) as well as infrequently by transmission from mother to ''newborn''.' "
How is viral hepatitis diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of viral hepatitis is based on symptoms and physical findings as well as blood tests for ''liver enzymes'', viral antibodies, and viral genetic materials.''Diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis often is easy, but the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis can be difficult. When a patient reports symptoms of ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', darkening of urine, and then develops jaundice, the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis is likely and can be confirmed by blood tests. On the other hand, patients with chronic hepatitis due to HBV and HCV often have no symptoms or only mild nonspecific symptoms such as ''chronic fatigue''. Typically, these patients do not have jaundice until the liver damage is far advanced. Therefore, these patients can remain undiagnosed for years to decades.''There are three types of blood tests for evaluating patients with hepatitis: liver enzymes, antibodies to the hepatitis viruses, and viral proteins or genetic material (viral DNA or RNA).''Liver enzymes'': Among the most sensitive and widely used blood tests for evaluating patients with hepatitis are liver enzymes, called aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes normally are contained within liver cells. If the liver is injured (as in viral hepatitis), the liver cells spill the enzymes into the blood, raising the enzyme levels in the blood and signaling that the liver is damaged.''The normal range of values for AST is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood) while the normal range of values for ALT is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum. (These normal levels may vary slightly depending on the laboratory.) Patients with acute viral hepatitis (for example, due to HAV or HBV) can develop very high AST and ALT levels, sometimes in the thousands of units per liter. These high AST and ALT levels will become normal in several weeks or months as the patients recover completely from their acute hepatitis. In contrast, patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection typically have only mildly elevated AST and ALT levels, but these abnormalities can last years or decades. Since most patients with chronic hepatitis are asymptomatic (no jaundice or nausea), their mildly abnormal liver enzymes are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests during yearly physical examinations or insurance physicals.''Elevated blood levels of AST and ALT only means that the liver is inflamed, and elevations can be caused by many agents other than hepatitis viruses, such as medications, alcohol, bacteria, fungi, etc. In order to prove that a hepatitis virus is responsible for the elevations, blood must be tested for antibodies to each of the hepatitis viruses as well as for their genetic material.''Viral antibodies'': Antibodies are proteins produced by white blood cells that attack invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies against the hepatitis A, B, and C viruses usually can be detected in the blood within weeks of infection, and the antibodies remain detectable in the blood for decades thereafter. Blood tests for the antibodies can be helpful in diagnosing both acute and chronic viral hepatitis.''In acute viral hepatitis, antibodies not only help to eradicate the virus, but they also protect the patient from future infections by the same virus, that is, the patient develops immunity. In chronic hepatitis, however, antibodies and the rest of the immune system are unable to eradicate the virus. The viruses continue to multiply and are released from the liver cells into the blood where their presence can be determined by measuring the viral proteins and genetic material. Therefore, in chronic hepatitis, both antibodies to the viruses and viral proteins and genetic material can be detected in the blood.''Examples of tests for viral antibodies are:''Viral proteins and genetic material'': Examples of tests for viral proteins and genetic material are:''Other tests'': Obstruction of the bile ducts, from either ''gallstones'' or cancer, occasionally can mimic acute viral hepatitis. ''Ultrasound'' testing can be used to exclude the possibility of ''gallstones'' or cancer.' anti-HAV (hepatitis A antibody) antibody to hepatitis B core, an antibody directed against the inner core material of the virus (core antigen) antibody to hepatitis B surface, an antibody directed against the outer surface envelope of the virus (surface antigen) antibody to hepatitis B e, an antibody directed against the genetic material of the virus (e antigen) hepatitis C antibody, the antibody against the C virus hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis B DNA hepatitis B e antigen hepatitis C RNA"
What is the treatment for viral hepatitis?,"'Treatment of acute viral hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis are different. Treatment of acute viral hepatitis involves resting, relieving symptoms, and maintaining an adequate intake of fluids. Treatment of chronic viral hepatitis involves medications to eradicate the virus and taking measures to prevent further liver damage.''In patients with acute viral hepatitis, the initial treatment consists of relieving the symptoms of nausea, ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain'' (supportive care). Careful attention should be given to medications or compounds, which can have adverse effects in patients with abnormal ''liver function'' (for example, ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol'' and others], alcohol, etc.). Only those medications that are considered necessary should be administered since the impaired liver is not able to eliminate drugs normally, and drugs may accumulate in the blood and reach toxic levels. Moreover, ''sedatives'' and ""tranquilizers"" are avoided because they may accentuate the effects of liver failure on the brain and cause lethargy and ''coma''. The patient must abstain from drinking alcohol since alcohol is toxic to the liver. It occasionally is necessary to provide intravenous fluids to prevent ''dehydration'' caused by vomiting. Patients with severe nausea and/or vomiting may need to be hospitalized for treatment and intravenous fluids.''Acute HBV is not treated with antiviral drugs. Acute HCV - though rarely diagnosed - can be treated with several of the drugs used for treating chronic HCV. Treatment of HCV is recommended primarily for the 80% of patients who do not eradicate the virus early. Treatment results in the clearing of the virus in the majority of patients.''Treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C usually involves medication or combinations of medications to eradicate the virus. Doctors believe that in properly selected patients, successful eradication of the viruses can stop progressive damage to the liver and prevent the development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Alcohol aggravates liver damage in chronic hepatitis and can cause more rapid progression to cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with chronic hepatitis should stop drinking alcohol. ''Smoking'' cigarettes also can aggravate the ''liver disease'' and should be stopped.''Medications for chronic hepatitis C infection include:''Medications for chronic hepatitis B infection include:''Because of constantly ongoing research and development of new antiviral agents, the current list of medications for chronic hepatitis B and C infections is likely to change every year. Many of those drugs which are currently available are rarely used because of newer, safer, and more effective alternatives.''Decisions regarding the treatment of chronic hepatitis can be complex and should be directed by gastroenterologists, hepatologists (doctors specially trained in treating diseases of the liver), or infectious disease specialists for several reasons including:''In addition, recent research has shown that a combination of certain antiviral medications results in a cure (viral clearance) in many patients with chronic hepatitis C. Further studies and FDA approval is pending.''Treatment of acute fulminant hepatitis should be done in centers that can perform liver transplantation since acute fulminant hepatitis has a high mortality (about 80%) without liver transplantation.'   oral daclatasvir (Daklinza) oral ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Ombitasvir + Dasabuvir and Ribavirin Simeprevir + Sofosbuvir Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Ombitasvir + Dasabuvir oral entecavir (Baraclude) oral tenofovir (Viread) The diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis may not be straightforward. Sometimes a liver biopsy may have to be performed for confirmation of liver damage. Doctors experienced in managing chronic liver diseases must weigh the risk of liver biopsy against the potential benefits of the biopsy. Not all patients with chronic viral hepatitis are candidates for treatment. Some patients need no treatment (since some patients with chronic hepatitis B and C do not develop progressive liver damage or liver cancer). Medications for chronic infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C are not always effective. Prolonged treatment for up to 6 months is often necessary.  The success rate for a sustained viral response for chronic hep C is 90%."
How is viral hepatitis prevented?,"'Prevention of hepatitis involves measures to avoid exposure to the viruses, using immunoglobulin in the event of exposure, and ''vaccines''. Administration of immunoglobulin is called passive protection because antibodies from patients who have had viral hepatitis are given to the patient. Vaccination is called active protection because killed viruses or non-infectious components of viruses are given to stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies.'""Prevention of viral hepatitis, like any other illness, is preferable to reliance upon treatment. Taking precautions to prevent exposure to another individual's blood (exposure to dirty needles), semen (unprotected sex), and other bodily secretions and waste (stool, vomit) will help prevent the spread of all of these viruses.""'Immune serum globulin (ISG) is human serum that contains antibodies to hepatitis A. ISG can be administered to prevent infection in individuals who have been exposed to hepatitis A. ISG works immediately upon administration, and the duration of protection is several months. ISG usually is given to ''travelers'' to regions of the world where there are high rates of hepatitis A infection and to close or household contacts of patients with hepatitis A infection. ISG is safe with few side effects.''Hepatitis B immune globulin or HBIG (BayHep B), is human serum that contains antibodies to hepatitis B. HBIG is made from plasma (a blood product) that is known to contain a high concentration of antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen. If given within 10 days of exposure to the virus, HBIG almost always is successful in preventing infection. Even if given a bit later, however, HBIG may lessen the severity of HBV infection. The protection against hepatitis B lasts for about three weeks after the HBIG is given. HBIG also is given at birth to infants born to mothers known to have hepatitis B infection. In addition, HBIG is given to individuals exposed to HBV because of sexual contact or to healthcare workers accidentally stuck by a needle known to be contaminated with blood from an infected person.' "
Hepatitis Vaccinations,"'Two hepatitis A vaccines are available in the US, ''hepatitis A vaccine'' (''Havrix'', ''Vaqta''). Both contain inactive (killed) hepatitis A virus. For adults, two doses of the ''vaccine'' are recommended. After the first dose, protective antibodies develop in 70% of vaccine recipients within 2 weeks, and almost 100% of recipients by 4 weeks. After two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine, immunity against hepatitis A infection is believed to last for many years.''Individuals at increased risk for acquiring hepatitis A and individuals with chronic ''liver disease'' (for example, cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis C) should be vaccinated. Although individuals with chronic liver disease are not at increased risk for acquiring hepatitis A, they can develop serious (sometimes fatal) liver failure if they become infected with hepatitis A and, thus, they should be vaccinated.''Individuals at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A are:''Some local health authorities or private companies may require hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers.''Because protective antibodies take weeks to develop, travelers to countries where infection with hepatitis A is common should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before departure. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that immunoglobulin be given in addition to vaccination if departure is prior to 4 weeks. Immunoglobulin provides quicker protection than the vaccines, but the protection is short-lived.'""For active vaccination, a harmless hepatitis B antigen is given to stimulate the body's immune system to produce protective antibodies against the surface antigen of hepatitis B. Vaccines that are currently available in the U.S. are made (synthesized) using recombinant DNA technology (joining DNA segments). These recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, ""'hepatitis B vaccine'' (Energix-B and Recombivax-HB) are constructed to contain only that part of the surface antigen that is very potent in stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. The vaccine contains no viral component other than the surface antigen, and therefore, cannot cause HBV infections. Hepatitis B vaccines should be given in three doses with the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose 4 to 6 months after the first dose. For the best results, the vaccinations should be given in the deltoid (shoulder) muscles and not in the buttocks.''Hepatitis B vaccines are 90% effective in healthy adults and 95% in infants, children, and adolescents. Five percent of vaccinated individuals will fail to develop the necessary antibodies for immunity after the three doses. Patients with weakened immunity (such as ''HIV'' infection), older patients, and patients undergoing kidney hemodialysis are more likely to fail to respond to the vaccines.''Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for:''All ''pregnant'' women should have a blood test for the antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Women who test positive for hepatitis B virus (positive hepatitis B surface antigen) risk transmitting the virus to their infants during ''labor'', and, therefore, infants born to mothers with hepatitis B infection should receive HBIG in addition to hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The reason for giving both immunoglobulin and vaccine is that even though hepatitis B vaccine can offer long lasting, active immunity, immunity takes weeks or months to develop. Until active immunity develops, the short-lived, passive antibodies from the HBIG protect the infant.''Unvaccinated individuals exposed to materials infected with hepatitis B (such as healthcare workers stuck by a contaminated needle) will need HBIG in addition to hepatitis B vaccine for the same reason as infants born to mothers with hepatitis B infection.''There is currently no vaccine for hepatitis C. Development of such a vaccine is difficult due to the six different forms (genotypes) of hepatitis C. No vaccine for hepatitis D is available. However, HBV vaccine can prevent an individual not infected with HBV from contracting hepatitis D because hepatitis D virus requires live HBV to replicate in the body.'  Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common Men who have sex with men Illegal drug users (either injection or non-injection drug use) Researchers working with hepatitis A or with primates that are susceptible to infection with hepatitis A Patients with clotting factor disorders who are receiving clotting factor concentrates that can transmit hepatitis A All infants Adolescents under 18 years of age who did not receive hepatitis B vaccine as infants People occupationally exposed to blood or body fluids Residents and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled Patients receiving kidney hemodialysis People who with hemophilia and other patients receiving clotting factor concentrates Household contacts and sexual partners of patients infected with hepatitis B chronically Travelers who will spend more than 6 months in regions with high rates of hepatitis B infection Injection drug users and their sexual partners Men who have sex with men, men or women with multiple sex partners, or recent infection with a sexually transmitted infection Inmates of long-term correctional facilities"
What is the prognosis of viral hepatitis?,"'The prognosis of viral hepatitis for most patients is good; however, this prognosis varies somewhat depending on the infecting virus. For example, those patients who develop chronic hepatitis have a worse prognosis because of the potential to develop cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer (hepatocellular ''carcinoma''), and occasionally death. Symptoms of viral hepatitis such as ''fatigue'', poor appetite, nausea, and jaundice usually subside in several weeks to months, without any specific treatment. In fact, virtually all patients with acute infection with HAV and most adults (greater than 95%) with acute HBV recover completely. Complete recovery from viral hepatitis means that:''Unfortunately, not all patients with viral hepatitis recover completely. Five to 10 percent of patients with acute HBV infection and about 75% to 80% of patients with acute HCV infection develop chronic hepatitis. Patients (about 0.5% to 1%) that develop fulminant hepatitis have about an 80% fatality rate. Chronic HCV infections are the leading cause for liver transplants.''Because the liver works to detoxify substances, this task is compromised during acute and chronic viral hepatitis infections. Consequently, avoiding items that may ''stress'' the compromised livers function (for example, alcohol, ''smoking'', taking drugs that require liver processing) should be strongly considered by the patient to improve their prognosis.' the hepatitis virus has been completely eliminated from the liver by the body's immune system, the inflammation in the liver subsides, the patient develops immunity to future infection with the same virus, and the patient cannot transmit the infection to others."
Viral hepatitis definition and overview,"'Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Many illnesses and conditions can cause inflammation of the liver, for example, ''drugs'', ''alcohol'', chemicals, and autoimmune diseases. Many viruses, for example, the virus causing\xa0''mononucleosis'' and the ''cytomegalovirus'', can inflame the liver. Most viruses, however, do not attack primarily the liver; the liver is just one of several organs that the viruses affect. When most doctors speak of viral hepatitis, they are using the definition that means hepatitis caused by a few specific viruses that primarily attack the liver and are responsible for about half of all human hepatitis. There are several hepatitis viruses; they have been named types A, B, C, D, E, F (not confirmed), and G. As our knowledge of hepatitis viruses grows, it is likely that this alphabetical list will become longer. The most common hepatitis viruses are types A, B, and C. Reference to the hepatitis viruses often occurs in an abbreviated form (for example, HAV, ''HBV'', ''HCV'' represent hepatitis viruses A, B, and C, respectively.) The focus of this article is on these viruses that cause the majority of human viral hepatitis.''Hepatitis viruses replicate (multiply) primarily in the liver cells. This can cause the liver to be unable to perform its functions. The following is a list of major functions of the liver:''When the liver is inflamed, it does not perform these functions well, which brings about many of the symptoms, signs, and problems associated with any type of hepatitis. Each hepatitis viral type (A-F) has both articles and books describing the details of infection with that specific virus. This article is designed to give the reader an overview of the predominant viruses that cause viral hepatitis, their symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments, and should help the reader choose the subject(s) for more in-depth information.' The liver helps purify the blood by changing harmful chemicals into harmless ones. The source of these chemicals can be external, such as medications or alcohol, or internal, such as ammonia or bilirubin. Typically, these harmful chemicals are broken down into smaller chemicals or attached to other chemicals that then are eliminated from the body in the urine or stool. The liver produces many important substances, especially proteins that are necessary for good health. For example, it produces albumin, the protein building block of the body, as well as the proteins that cause blood to clot properly. The liver stores many sugars, fats and vitamins until they are needed elsewhere in the body. The liver builds smaller chemicals into larger, more complicated chemicals that are needed elsewhere in the body. Examples of this type of function are the manufacture of a fat, cholesterol, and the protein bilirubin."

For unknown reasons, these patients' immune systems are unable to eradicate the viruses, and the viruses cause chronic inflammation of the liver. Chronic hepatitis can lead to the development over time of extensive liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver ""'cancer''. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C infection is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the U.S. Patients with chronic viral hepatitis can transmit the infection to others with blood or body fluids (for example, sharing needles, sexually, and infrequently by organ donation) as well as infrequently by transmission from mother to ''newborn''.' "
How is viral hepatitis diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of viral hepatitis is based on symptoms and physical findings as well as blood tests for ''liver enzymes'', viral antibodies, and viral genetic materials.''Diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis often is easy, but the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis can be difficult. When a patient reports symptoms of ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', darkening of urine, and then develops jaundice, the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis is likely and can be confirmed by blood tests. On the other hand, patients with chronic hepatitis due to HBV and HCV often have no symptoms or only mild nonspecific symptoms such as ''chronic fatigue''. Typically, these patients do not have jaundice until the liver damage is far advanced. Therefore, these patients can remain undiagnosed for years to decades.''There are three types of blood tests for evaluating patients with hepatitis: liver enzymes, antibodies to the hepatitis viruses, and viral proteins or genetic material (viral DNA or RNA).''Liver enzymes'': Among the most sensitive and widely used blood tests for evaluating patients with hepatitis are liver enzymes, called aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes normally are contained within liver cells. If the liver is injured (as in viral hepatitis), the liver cells spill the enzymes into the blood, raising the enzyme levels in the blood and signaling that the liver is damaged.''The normal range of values for AST is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood) while the normal range of values for ALT is from 7 to 56 units per liter of serum. (These normal levels may vary slightly depending on the laboratory.) Patients with acute viral hepatitis (for example, due to HAV or HBV) can develop very high AST and ALT levels, sometimes in the thousands of units per liter. These high AST and ALT levels will become normal in several weeks or months as the patients recover completely from their acute hepatitis. In contrast, patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection typically have only mildly elevated AST and ALT levels, but these abnormalities can last years or decades. Since most patients with chronic hepatitis are asymptomatic (no jaundice or nausea), their mildly abnormal liver enzymes are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests during yearly physical examinations or insurance physicals.''Elevated blood levels of AST and ALT only means that the liver is inflamed, and elevations can be caused by many agents other than hepatitis viruses, such as medications, alcohol, bacteria, fungi, etc. In order to prove that a hepatitis virus is responsible for the elevations, blood must be tested for antibodies to each of the hepatitis viruses as well as for their genetic material.''Viral antibodies'': Antibodies are proteins produced by white blood cells that attack invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies against the hepatitis A, B, and C viruses usually can be detected in the blood within weeks of infection, and the antibodies remain detectable in the blood for decades thereafter. Blood tests for the antibodies can be helpful in diagnosing both acute and chronic viral hepatitis.''In acute viral hepatitis, antibodies not only help to eradicate the virus, but they also protect the patient from future infections by the same virus, that is, the patient develops immunity. In chronic hepatitis, however, antibodies and the rest of the immune system are unable to eradicate the virus. The viruses continue to multiply and are released from the liver cells into the blood where their presence can be determined by measuring the viral proteins and genetic material. Therefore, in chronic hepatitis, both antibodies to the viruses and viral proteins and genetic material can be detected in the blood.''Examples of tests for viral antibodies are:''Viral proteins and genetic material'': Examples of tests for viral proteins and genetic material are:''Other tests'': Obstruction of the bile ducts, from either ''gallstones'' or cancer, occasionally can mimic acute viral hepatitis. ''Ultrasound'' testing can be used to exclude the possibility of ''gallstones'' or cancer.' anti-HAV (hepatitis A antibody) antibody to hepatitis B core, an antibody directed against the inner core material of the virus (core antigen) antibody to hepatitis B surface, an antibody directed against the outer surface envelope of the virus (surface antigen) antibody to hepatitis B e, an antibody directed against the genetic material of the virus (e antigen) hepatitis C antibody, the antibody against the C virus hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis B DNA hepatitis B e antigen hepatitis C RNA"
What is the treatment for viral hepatitis?,"'Treatment of acute viral hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis are different. Treatment of acute viral hepatitis involves resting, relieving symptoms, and maintaining an adequate intake of fluids. Treatment of chronic viral hepatitis involves medications to eradicate the virus and taking measures to prevent further liver damage.''In patients with acute viral hepatitis, the initial treatment consists of relieving the symptoms of nausea, ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain'' (supportive care). Careful attention should be given to medications or compounds, which can have adverse effects in patients with abnormal ''liver function'' (for example, ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol'' and others], alcohol, etc.). Only those medications that are considered necessary should be administered since the impaired liver is not able to eliminate drugs normally, and drugs may accumulate in the blood and reach toxic levels. Moreover, ''sedatives'' and ""tranquilizers"" are avoided because they may accentuate the effects of liver failure on the brain and cause lethargy and ''coma''. The patient must abstain from drinking alcohol since alcohol is toxic to the liver. It occasionally is necessary to provide intravenous fluids to prevent ''dehydration'' caused by vomiting. Patients with severe nausea and/or vomiting may need to be hospitalized for treatment and intravenous fluids.''Acute HBV is not treated with antiviral drugs. Acute HCV - though rarely diagnosed - can be treated with several of the drugs used for treating chronic HCV. Treatment of HCV is recommended primarily for the 80% of patients who do not eradicate the virus early. Treatment results in the clearing of the virus in the majority of patients.''Treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C usually involves medication or combinations of medications to eradicate the virus. Doctors believe that in properly selected patients, successful eradication of the viruses can stop progressive damage to the liver and prevent the development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Alcohol aggravates liver damage in chronic hepatitis and can cause more rapid progression to cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with chronic hepatitis should stop drinking alcohol. ''Smoking'' cigarettes also can aggravate the ''liver disease'' and should be stopped.''Medications for chronic hepatitis C infection include:''Medications for chronic hepatitis B infection include:''Because of constantly ongoing research and development of new antiviral agents, the current list of medications for chronic hepatitis B and C infections is likely to change every year. Many of those drugs which are currently available are rarely used because of newer, safer, and more effective alternatives.''Decisions regarding the treatment of chronic hepatitis can be complex and should be directed by gastroenterologists, hepatologists (doctors specially trained in treating diseases of the liver), or infectious disease specialists for several reasons including:''In addition, recent research has shown that a combination of certain antiviral medications results in a cure (viral clearance) in many patients with chronic hepatitis C. Further studies and FDA approval is pending.''Treatment of acute fulminant hepatitis should be done in centers that can perform liver transplantation since acute fulminant hepatitis has a high mortality (about 80%) without liver transplantation.'   oral daclatasvir (Daklinza) oral ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Ombitasvir + Dasabuvir and Ribavirin Simeprevir + Sofosbuvir Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Ombitasvir + Dasabuvir oral entecavir (Baraclude) oral tenofovir (Viread) The diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis may not be straightforward. Sometimes a liver biopsy may have to be performed for confirmation of liver damage. Doctors experienced in managing chronic liver diseases must weigh the risk of liver biopsy against the potential benefits of the biopsy. Not all patients with chronic viral hepatitis are candidates for treatment. Some patients need no treatment (since some patients with chronic hepatitis B and C do not develop progressive liver damage or liver cancer). Medications for chronic infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C are not always effective. Prolonged treatment for up to 6 months is often necessary.  The success rate for a sustained viral response for chronic hep C is 90%."
How is viral hepatitis prevented?,"'Prevention of hepatitis involves measures to avoid exposure to the viruses, using immunoglobulin in the event of exposure, and ''vaccines''. Administration of immunoglobulin is called passive protection because antibodies from patients who have had viral hepatitis are given to the patient. Vaccination is called active protection because killed viruses or non-infectious components of viruses are given to stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies.'""Prevention of viral hepatitis, like any other illness, is preferable to reliance upon treatment. Taking precautions to prevent exposure to another individual's blood (exposure to dirty needles), semen (unprotected sex), and other bodily secretions and waste (stool, vomit) will help prevent the spread of all of these viruses.""'Immune serum globulin (ISG) is human serum that contains antibodies to hepatitis A. ISG can be administered to prevent infection in individuals who have been exposed to hepatitis A. ISG works immediately upon administration, and the duration of protection is several months. ISG usually is given to ''travelers'' to regions of the world where there are high rates of hepatitis A infection and to close or household contacts of patients with hepatitis A infection. ISG is safe with few side effects.''Hepatitis B immune globulin or HBIG (BayHep B), is human serum that contains antibodies to hepatitis B. HBIG is made from plasma (a blood product) that is known to contain a high concentration of antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen. If given within 10 days of exposure to the virus, HBIG almost always is successful in preventing infection. Even if given a bit later, however, HBIG may lessen the severity of HBV infection. The protection against hepatitis B lasts for about three weeks after the HBIG is given. HBIG also is given at birth to infants born to mothers known to have hepatitis B infection. In addition, HBIG is given to individuals exposed to HBV because of sexual contact or to healthcare workers accidentally stuck by a needle known to be contaminated with blood from an infected person.' "
Hepatitis Vaccinations,"'Two hepatitis A vaccines are available in the US, ''hepatitis A vaccine'' (''Havrix'', ''Vaqta''). Both contain inactive (killed) hepatitis A virus. For adults, two doses of the ''vaccine'' are recommended. After the first dose, protective antibodies develop in 70% of vaccine recipients within 2 weeks, and almost 100% of recipients by 4 weeks. After two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine, immunity against hepatitis A infection is believed to last for many years.''Individuals at increased risk for acquiring hepatitis A and individuals with chronic ''liver disease'' (for example, cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis C) should be vaccinated. Although individuals with chronic liver disease are not at increased risk for acquiring hepatitis A, they can develop serious (sometimes fatal) liver failure if they become infected with hepatitis A and, thus, they should be vaccinated.''Individuals at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A are:''Some local health authorities or private companies may require hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers.''Because protective antibodies take weeks to develop, travelers to countries where infection with hepatitis A is common should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before departure. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that immunoglobulin be given in addition to vaccination if departure is prior to 4 weeks. Immunoglobulin provides quicker protection than the vaccines, but the protection is short-lived.'""For active vaccination, a harmless hepatitis B antigen is given to stimulate the body's immune system to produce protective antibodies against the surface antigen of hepatitis B. Vaccines that are currently available in the U.S. are made (synthesized) using recombinant DNA technology (joining DNA segments). These recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, ""'hepatitis B vaccine'' (Energix-B and Recombivax-HB) are constructed to contain only that part of the surface antigen that is very potent in stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. The vaccine contains no viral component other than the surface antigen, and therefore, cannot cause HBV infections. Hepatitis B vaccines should be given in three doses with the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose 4 to 6 months after the first dose. For the best results, the vaccinations should be given in the deltoid (shoulder) muscles and not in the buttocks.''Hepatitis B vaccines are 90% effective in healthy adults and 95% in infants, children, and adolescents. Five percent of vaccinated individuals will fail to develop the necessary antibodies for immunity after the three doses. Patients with weakened immunity (such as ''HIV'' infection), older patients, and patients undergoing kidney hemodialysis are more likely to fail to respond to the vaccines.''Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for:''All ''pregnant'' women should have a blood test for the antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Women who test positive for hepatitis B virus (positive hepatitis B surface antigen) risk transmitting the virus to their infants during ''labor'', and, therefore, infants born to mothers with hepatitis B infection should receive HBIG in addition to hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The reason for giving both immunoglobulin and vaccine is that even though hepatitis B vaccine can offer long lasting, active immunity, immunity takes weeks or months to develop. Until active immunity develops, the short-lived, passive antibodies from the HBIG protect the infant.''Unvaccinated individuals exposed to materials infected with hepatitis B (such as healthcare workers stuck by a contaminated needle) will need HBIG in addition to hepatitis B vaccine for the same reason as infants born to mothers with hepatitis B infection.''There is currently no vaccine for hepatitis C. Development of such a vaccine is difficult due to the six different forms (genotypes) of hepatitis C. No vaccine for hepatitis D is available. However, HBV vaccine can prevent an individual not infected with HBV from contracting hepatitis D because hepatitis D virus requires live HBV to replicate in the body.'  Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common Men who have sex with men Illegal drug users (either injection or non-injection drug use) Researchers working with hepatitis A or with primates that are susceptible to infection with hepatitis A Patients with clotting factor disorders who are receiving clotting factor concentrates that can transmit hepatitis A All infants Adolescents under 18 years of age who did not receive hepatitis B vaccine as infants People occupationally exposed to blood or body fluids Residents and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled Patients receiving kidney hemodialysis People who with hemophilia and other patients receiving clotting factor concentrates Household contacts and sexual partners of patients infected with hepatitis B chronically Travelers who will spend more than 6 months in regions with high rates of hepatitis B infection Injection drug users and their sexual partners Men who have sex with men, men or women with multiple sex partners, or recent infection with a sexually transmitted infection Inmates of long-term correctional facilities"
What is the prognosis of viral hepatitis?,"'The prognosis of viral hepatitis for most patients is good; however, this prognosis varies somewhat depending on the infecting virus. For example, those patients who develop chronic hepatitis have a worse prognosis because of the potential to develop cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer (hepatocellular ''carcinoma''), and occasionally death. Symptoms of viral hepatitis such as ''fatigue'', poor appetite, nausea, and jaundice usually subside in several weeks to months, without any specific treatment. In fact, virtually all patients with acute infection with HAV and most adults (greater than 95%) with acute HBV recover completely. Complete recovery from viral hepatitis means that:''Unfortunately, not all patients with viral hepatitis recover completely. Five to 10 percent of patients with acute HBV infection and about 75% to 80% of patients with acute HCV infection develop chronic hepatitis. Patients (about 0.5% to 1%) that develop fulminant hepatitis have about an 80% fatality rate. Chronic HCV infections are the leading cause for liver transplants.''Because the liver works to detoxify substances, this task is compromised during acute and chronic viral hepatitis infections. Consequently, avoiding items that may ''stress'' the compromised livers function (for example, alcohol, ''smoking'', taking drugs that require liver processing) should be strongly considered by the patient to improve their prognosis.' the hepatitis virus has been completely eliminated from the liver by the body's immune system, the inflammation in the liver subsides, the patient develops immunity to future infection with the same virus, and the patient cannot transmit the infection to others."
What is viral pneumonia?,"'Pneumonia'' is an infection in your ''lungs'' that is usually caused by bacteria, ''viruses'' or fungi. About 30% of ''pneumonia''\xa0 cases reported in the United States are viral.''These viruses can transmit through the droplets of fluids in the air that are scattered after an infected person sneezes or ''coughs''. These fluid drops may find their way into your body through your nose or mouth. You may get viral ''pneumonia'' after touching infected surfaces such as a doorknob or keyboard and then touching your mouth or nose.' "
What are the symptoms of viral pneumonia?,'You must visit a ''pulmonologist''/doctor soon if you have' Dry cough Fever Chills Breathing difficulty Pain in your chest Rapid breathing
What causes viral pneumonia?,"'There are various viruses that can lead to pneumonia.' Influenza (flu) A and B viruses are the most common causes of pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of infection in infants and children. Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) cause COVID-19 infection. Rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses can cause pink eye. Other viruses that cause herpes simplex (herpes simplex virus [HSV]), measles and chickenpox may rarely cause pneumonia."
How will the doctor diagnose my viral pneumonia?,"'Depending on the severity of your infection, your doctor will diagnose pneumonia.\xa0''If you have mild symptoms, your doctor may ask for''However, in older adults (≥65 years) or children, the doctor may ask to test a throat swab culture. Your doctor may also ask for a test in which a camera is put down in your throat to check the airways.' Blood tests Chest X-ray"
How will the doctor treat my viral pneumonia?," In a viral infection, antibiotics won’t help; therefore, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications. Plenty of fluids and medicines to bring down fever and chest congestion may be prescribed by your doctor. Depending on the microorganism causing the infection, you may receive antivirals such as Tamiflu to stop the spread of flu virus in your body. If you have been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, you may receive ribavirin to limit the spread of viruses. It is important to get plenty of rest to get over this infection. Talk to your doctor before taking cough or cold medicines, especially in the case of children. Supplements such as vitamin C, zinc and B vitamins may help speed recovery. After treatment, check your lungs to make sure they are all clear. In severe cases if you have breathlessness, you may need to be hospitalized for oxygen therapy and intravenous fluid therapy. If it gets worse, you may require a ventilator."
How can I prevent viral pneumonia?,"'To prevent the transmission of pneumonia, you must' Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. In public places, use sanitizers to disinfect your hands before eating anything. Get a flu vaccine at the beginning of winter or the rainy season to protect you from certain strains of viruses. Keep your distance from people who are sick and who are coughing and sneezing. Use a mask to prevent infected droplets from entering your body. Do not touch your eyes, ears, nose and mouth when outside."
What is colonoscopy?,"'Colonoscopy'' is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to evaluate the appearance of the inside of the colon (large bowel). This is accomplished by inserting a long flexible tube (the ''colonoscope'') that is about the thickness of a finger into the anus and then advancing the colonoscope slowly into the rectum and through the colon. The tip of the colonoscope has a light and a video camera. The inner colon lining can be directly visualized in images transmitted from the camera to a television monitor. This traditional method of examination of the colon is called optical colonoscopy or, more commonly, just colonoscopy.''In preparation for colonoscopy, the day before the examination the colon is emptied using laxatives. Immediately prior to colonoscopy, an intravenous infusion (IV) is started, and the patient is placed on a monitor for continuously monitoring the rhythm of the ''heart'', ''blood pressure'', and the amount of oxygen in the blood. Medication usually is given by IV to make the patient sleepy and relaxed. If needed, the patient can receive additional doses of medication during the procedure. Colonoscopy often gives a feeling of pressure, cramping, and ''bloating''; however, with the aid of the medication, colonoscopy generally is well tolerated and infrequently results in significant ''pain''. The type of anesthesia caused by the intravenous medications is classified as conscious sedation and is safer than general anesthesia. With conscious sedation, patients are sleepy but still arousable, and able to breathe on their own. After the colonoscopy, patients are asked not to drive for the rest of the day if medications for conscious sedation were given.''Should there be polyps (benign growths that can lead to ''cancer'') in the colon, the polyps, almost always can be removed through the colonoscope. Removal of these polyps is an important method of preventing ''colorectal cancer''.' "
What is virtual colonoscopy?,"'Virtual colonoscopy is a technique that uses a computerized tomographic (CT) scan (a type of three-dimensional x-ray) to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained by direct observation by optical colonoscopy.''In preparation for virtual colonoscopy, the day before the examination the colon is emptied using laxatives in a manner similar to traditional colonoscopy. During the examination, a small tube is inserted into the anus to inject and fill the colon with air. Unlike with traditional colonoscopy, this tube is not advanced into the colon. The ''CT scan'' then is performed, and the scans are manipulated by computer software to form virtual images of the colon. When properly performed, virtual colonoscopy can be as effective as routine colonoscopy. It can even find polyps ""hiding"" behind folds that occasionally are missed by traditional colonoscopy. The scanning takes only 10 minutes, and usually no conscious sedation is necessary.''In October, 2007, researchers from University of Wisconsin published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' a study comparing traditional colonoscopy to virtual colonoscopy. More than six thousand patients over age 50 were evenly divided to undergo either optical or virtual colonoscopy. The researchers found that virtual colonoscopy was as effective as optical colonoscopy in detecting polyps larger than 5mm.'  "
Comparing virtual colonoscopy and traditional colonoscopy ," Virtual colonoscopy is less invasive and faster to perform than traditional colonoscopy and does not require conscious sedation. Even though virtual colonoscopy is less invasive than traditional colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy still involves injecting air into the colon, which can be uncomfortable for some patients. On the other hand, with adequate conscious sedation, patients usually experience little or no discomfort with traditional colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is not as reliable as routine colonoscopy in detecting small polyps (less than 5mm in size). Even though most experts believe that polyps smaller than 5mm are usually benign, some small polyps can be cancerous or become cancerous if not removed. Virtual colonoscopy is not as accurate as traditional colonoscopy in finding flat cancers or polyps that are not protruding, that is, are not polyp-like. Virtual colonoscopy cannot remove polyps. If polyps are found by virtual colonoscopy, then traditional colonoscopy must be performed to remove the polyps. Therefore, many individuals having virtual colonoscopy will have to undergo a second procedure,. Even though the amount of radiation exposure with virtual colonoscopy is considered safe, the long term radiation effects of mass screening with CT is not known."
My personal approach to recommending virtual versus optical colonoscopies,"'New England Journal of Medicine'', October 2007'  In healthy patients who want all the polyps (including ones smaller than 5mm) to be removed, I recommend traditional colonoscopy In patients who do not want to undergo routine colonoscopy and are willing to accept the possibility of leaving small polyps untreated, virtual colonoscopy is an alternative. In unhealthy patients with advanced heart, lung, liver, or kidney diseases, virtual colonoscopy may be a safer and less invasive alternative to traditional colonoscopy."
What is Chikungunya virus?,'The infection caused by Chikungunya virus is was first described in East Africa in 1952. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and belongs to the family ''Togaviridae'' in the genus ''Alphavirus''.'  
Where is Chikungunya virus most prevalent?,"'Although Chikungunya virus has been mainly reported in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans, it has spread to the Americas recently. However, you no longer have to travel to a faraway place such as French Polynesia like Lindsay Lohan did in December 2014 to become infected. In 2013 the virus had spread to the Caribbean islands. As of December 2014, 41 countries or territories in the Caribbean, Central America, South America and North America have had laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya infections.'  "
How does Chikungunya virus spread?," Humans are infected when Aedes aegypti and albopictus mosquitoes, containing Chikungunya virus, bite humans. The viruses are transmitted during the mosquito bite (blood meal). The viruses then multiply in humans and can then be picked up by other uninfected mosquitoes when they bite infected humans to complete the viral replication cycle."
Is Chikungunya virus infection contagious?,"'Chikungunya virus infection is not considered to be ''contagious'' because there is no direct human to human transfer of Chikungunya viruses, so infected individuals cannot directly transfer the virus to another human because the virus has to pass through a mosquito first. However, outbreaks can occur in populations where a number of both mosquitoes and humans are infected with the virus. Rarely, the virus may be transmitted from the mother to her ''newborn''; also, researchers suggest the virus may possibly be transferred by blood transfusions from an infected individual.' "
What are Chikungunya virus infection symptoms and signs?,"'Most people that become infected with the virus will develop some symptoms usually within three to seven days after a bite by an infected mosquito.''The most common symptoms are''The affected individual also may develop''Most patients feel better in about seven days, but in some individuals the joint ''pain'' may last for months. The symptoms are similar to those of another disease, ''dengue fever'', which is also spread by the same mosquitoes.''Rare complications include''Neonates and the elderly (>65 years), especially those with other medical problems, are at highest risk for severe disease and complications''Death is rare and occurs mainly in the elderly.'  fever, joint pain, and swelling. headache, muscle pain, and/or rash. eye problems and inflammation of the heart, liver, brain, skin, kidneys and nerves."
How do health care professionals diagnose Chikungunya virus infections?,"'The Chikungunya disease may be diagnosed by blood antibody tests that distinguish between this infection and dengue ''fever'', a similar viral disease, and other diseases.''There is no medicine or ''vaccine'' available to specifically treat or prevent Chikungunya virus infections.' "
What is the treatment for Chikungunya virus infection?,"'Medical treatments and home remedies to relive symptoms of Chikungunya virus infections include''Once a person recovers from Chikungunya infection, researchers suggest the person develops life-long immunity to the virus type.'  rest, fluids, and any medicines that might reduce the fever and pain."
Is it possible to prevent a Chikungunya virus infection?,"'The best way to prevent Chikungunya infections is to avoid getting mosquito bites.''If you do become infected, you should protect yourself from any further mosquito bites because you can transfer the virus from you to a mosquito and possibly into another person if that mosquito bites another uninfected individual.' Eliminate areas where mosquitoes breed (emptying containers where water is left standing, for example). Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Use insect repellents appropriately."
What is a visual field test?,"""A visual field test is a method of measuring an individual's entire scope of vision, that is their central and peripheral (side) vision. Visual field testing maps the visual fields of each eye individually and can detect blind spots (scotomas) as well as more subtle areas of dim vision. The visual field test is a subjective examination, so the patient must be able to understand the testing instructions, fully cooperate, and complete the entire visual test in order to provide useful information."" "
What is a visual field test used for?,"'Visual field testing is most frequently used to detect signs of ''glaucoma'' damage to the ''optic nerve''. In addition, visual field tests are useful for detection of central or peripheral retinal diseases of the retina, ''eyelid'' conditions such as drooping (''ptosis''), optic nerve damage and disease, and conditions affecting the visual pathways from the optic nerve to the area of the brain (occipital cortex) where this information is processed into vision.''The following are uses of visual field testing:'  Screening for glaucoma: Peripheral vision loss is often an early and subtle sign of glaucoma. Visual field tests are helpful in detecting vision loss and making the diagnosis of glaucoma, and repeat testing is used to monitor treatment. Screening and testing for lid droop (ptosis) Testing for toxicity from certain medications (for example, screening for toxicity from hydroxychloroquine [Plaquenil], which can affect the central retina) Measuring the extent of retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa Detecting conditions affecting the optic nerve, such as tumors, injury, poor circulation or stroke, optic neuropathy, swelling of the optic nerve (optic neuritis), compression from swelling in the eye socket or orbit, and severe nutrient deficiencies Detecting conditions that affect the visual pathways from the optic nerves to the occipital lobe of the brain, including tumors, inflammatory disease, increased intracranial pressure, injury, poor circulation, or stroke Testing for malingering behavior or factitious disorders"
How is a visual field testing procedure performed?,"'There are a variety of methods to measure the visual fields. During an eye exam, visual field testing is performed one eye at a time, with the opposite eye completely covered to avoid errors. In all testing, the patient must look straight ahead at all times in order accurately map the peripheral visual field. Most modern visual field testing devices also continuously monitor fixation, or the ability of the patient to maintain a consistent straight ahead gaze.' "
What types of specialists perform visual field tests?,'Visual field tests are performed most often by eye doctors (optometrists and ophthalmologists) and neurologists. These specialists have training in visual field interpretation. The cost of visual field testing is usually covered by medical insurance.' 
What are the different types of visual field tests?," Confrontation visual field testing: The doctor faces the patient and asks the patient look straight ahead. The doctor will present stationary or moving targets in the patient's peripheral (side) visual fields. While maintaining a straight-ahead gaze, the patient lets the doctor know when he/she can see the target in the peripheral vision. The target may be a small disc on a stick, but most commonly the target is the doctor's hand holding up one or two fingers. Amsler grid: This is a printed image of a grid with a dot in the center. The patient is asked to look at the dot, one eye at a time, and note whether the grid lines surrounding the dot appear distorted, faded, or partially missing. This test is most often used to detect central visual field defects. Static automated perimetry (such as Octopus or the Humphrey Field Analyzer): Pinpoint flashes of light of varying size and brightness are projected within a large white bowl. The patient is asked to look at the center of the bowl and press a button each time a light is seen in the peripheral vision. The machine collects the data and uses sophisticated software to analyze the results. Kinetic perimetry (such as Goldmann perimeter): Moving targets of various light sizes and intensities are shown and the patient indicates when they become visible in the peripheral vision. The resulting data is used to map the full visual field. The full, normal range of the visual field extends approximately 120° vertically and a nearly 160° horizontally. Frequency doubling perimetry: This test utilizes varying intensities of a flickering image to analyze the visual field. It is particularly useful in detecting early glaucoma field loss."
How long does a visual field test take?,"'Visual field testing requires a minimal amount of time for most otherwise healthy patients, but it may be tiring or stressful for those who are ill or elderly. Visual field testing is also very difficult for younger children, patients with mental disabilities or developmental delay, or anyone with slowed reflexes or poor attention span.''If the first visual field test is read as abnormal or inconclusive because it was inaccurate, it may need to be repeated. It is not uncommon for patients to forget to keep their gazed fixed straight ahead. With repeat visual field testing, most patients find their ability to maintain a steady straight-ahead gaze improves, thus improving the reliability of the results.''The following are common testing times for visual fields in both eyes:' Amsler grid: a few minutes Confrontation visual field: a few minutes Static field for lid droop or ptosis screening: approximately eight minutes Static field for complete glaucoma evaluation: approximately 15 minutes Frequency Doubling Perimetry Testing (FDT) for glaucoma screening or evaluation: approximately 10 minutes Kinetic Goldmann Perimetry for complete glaucoma evaluation: approximately 20 minutes"
What is vitamin D?,"'The ""sunshine"" vitamin is a hot topic. You may have recently found out that you are deficient or know someone who is. It\'s shocking for most people when they have never had a problem before and believe nothing has changed to make it a problem now. The truth is that a lot has changed, and ''vitamin D'' deficiency and insufficiency is now a global public health problem affecting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide.''Vitamins'"" are considered essential nutrients because either your body cannot make them or they are made in inadequate amounts to prevent negative health consequences or diseases. So it's essential that you provide ""'vitamins'' for your body by food and/or ''supplements''. ''Vitamin D'' was discovered to be essential when it was found to be needed for the treatment of ''rickets''. ''Vitamin D'' is one of the four fat-soluble ''vitamins'' (A, D, E, and K). There are two forms of ''vitamin D'': D2 and D3. Vitamin D2, also known as ''ergocalciferol'', comes from fortified foods, plant foods, and ''over-the-counter'' ''supplements''. Vitamin D3, also known as ''cholecalciferol'', comes from fortified foods, animal foods (fatty fish, cod ''liver'' oil, eggs, and liver), ''supplements'', and can be made internally when your skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) ''radiation'' from the sun. Structurally, these two are not the same. Many believe that ''vitamin D'' should be classified as a hormone, with some calling it the forgotten neurosteroid. The health consequences of being deficient go far beyond ''rickets'' and what occurs with any other vitamin. And unlike other ''vitamins'', it can be made by your body when exposed to sun and the active form in your body, called calcitrol, has similarities to other hormones (estrogen, cortisol, and testosterone).''The real dangers of excess exposure to the sun and ''skin cancer'' have been greatly publicized and resulted in people covering up and using ''sunscreen'' when in the sun. We have also had a shift in spending less time outdoors because of increased work hours and more sedentary lives. As a result, ''vitamin D'' levels began dropping without most health care professionals realizing it. Researchers have been focusing on the consequences of ''vitamin D deficiency'' and have found an alarming number of health issues outside of its role with ''rickets''. These include skeletal diseases like ''osteoporosis'', certain ''cancers'', ''cardiovascular disease'', autoimmune diseases, infections, ''inflammatory bowel diseases'', ''psychological disorders'', cognitive disorders, ''obesity'', and or mortality. Correcting ''vitamin D deficiency'' is not as simple as taking a pill or getting more sun. This article will teach you all that you need to know about the benefits of achieving and maintaining optimal vitamin D levels and how you can do it.' "
What are the vitamin D requirements?,"'Only 20% of our vitamin D is meant to come from our ''diet'' with the remaining 80% provided by our skin from UV-B exposure to the sun. There are currently two sets of guidelines for vitamin D intake. Typically, vitamin guidelines are established by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the form of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) or adequate intakes (AI). The RDA is the average daily intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97.5%) healthy individuals. These guidelines were set on a population model to prevent vitamin D deficiency based on bone health (osteomalacia, rickets, ''bone mineral density'', and calcium absorption) for the general population. The Endocrine Society put together a task force to review the research and came up with a set of guidelines based on a medical model for those at risk for a deficiency. The two recommendations are as follows:''These amounts are based on what is needed to maintain the blood levels that each guideline committee has established as ideal. The higher the blood level that you need to maintain, the more vitamin D you will need to maintain that level. If your blood level is deficient, these are not the guidelines for you to follow. You will first need to get your levels up by taking vitamin D above these amounts and then you will follow these levels once you have reached your adequate level. Your health care provider can provide recommendations for a safe way to do this.' "
What are vitamin D deficiency symptoms and signs? What are health risks of vitamin D deficiency?,"'By the turn of the 20th century, 90% of the children living in New York, Boston, and Leyden in the Netherlands were afflicted with rickets, a bone-deforming disease. The first observation of this disease was in the mid-1600s by Whistler and Glissen, who reported that children living in industrialized cities in Great Britain had ''short stature'' and deformities of the skeleton, especially of the lower legs. It wasn\'t until 1889 that the discovery that ""sunbathing"" was important for preventing rickets came about.''Since then, many other health benefits of vitamin D and risks associated with deficiency have been reported. These include the following:'   Type 1 diabetes (T1DM): Research has shown that children with type 1 diabetes have a higher chance of having a vitamin D deficiency compared with the general population. In Finland, the recommendation for daily vitamin D supplementation was gradually reduced from 4,000-5,000 IU/day in 1964 to 400 IU/day in 1992. During this period, T1DM increased by 350% in those 1-4 years of age, 100% in those 5-9 years of age, and 50% in those 10-14 years of age. In 2006, authorities required that all dietary milk be fortified with vitamin D2, and the incidence of T1DM plateaued and began to decrease. Multiple sclerosis (MS): Current evidence supports that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing MS and alters the disease activity in people with MS. Numerous studies have linked the occurrence of MS with birth month. There is also a higher prevalence of MS in geographic areas farther from the equator, where people are exposed to less sunlight. The lack of sunlight exposure appears to be a significant predictor, and research is ongoing in this area. A large review of studies shows that with adequate vitamin D levels in people with MS there are fewer relapses, lower risk of development of new lesions in the brain, less disability and disease severity, and better nonverbal long-term memory performance. Studies now need to be done to confirm if this is directly due to vitamin D levels. Lupus: People with lupus are often photosensitive, causing rashes and possible disease flares when exposed to sunlight. The resulting lack of exposure to sunlight puts them at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. Evidence has shown that a deficiency can affect disease activity and damage along with contributing to the morbidity and mortality in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): A review of research found that people with the highest vitamin D levels had a 24.2% lower risk of developing RA compared to those with the lowest levels. They also found that there was a higher rate of vitamin D deficiency among people with RA than with the general population, and the activity of RA got worse as the level decreased. Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) (Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis): In a review of 20 studies, they found that AITD patients has lower levels and were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency compared with controls. In a review of 26 studies of Graves' disease, they concluded that low vitamin D status may increase the risk of Graves' disease."
What are vitamin D deficiency symptoms and signs? What are health risks of vitamin D deficiency? (Continued),"""It's been shown that vitamin D plays a crucial role in brain development, brain function regulation, and a healthy nervous system. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to be common in patients with """"Parkinson's disease""', '""Alzheimer's disease""', ''schizophrenia'', ''depression'', ''anxiety'' disorders, ''dementia'"", and older adults with cognitive decline. A meta-analysis reported a 2.4-times greater risk of cognitive impairment in people with low vitamin D levels versus those with adequate levels. It's been suggested that maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D levels throughout life may help to prevent age-related neurological disorders.""'A summit with the leading experts, including physicians and scientists, from across the world convened in 2013 to review the research in this area and to come up with clear guidelines for the medical and scientific communities. There was a unanimous agreement that low vitamin D levels and/or the insufficient utilization of vitamin D can be considered a risk factor for cognitive decline and ''dementia'' in general and supplementation was needed to correct these levels. A review of vitamin D levels in 170 women, 65-77 years of age, over 10 years found that adequate vitamin D levels may be protective against declines in cognitive flexibility and psychomotor speed components of executive function.''The association between lack of sunlight and depressive disorders was first noted 2,000 years ago. There are numerous studies showing low levels of vitamin D are associated with ''major depression'' and the symptoms of ''depression'"". In a study of over 6,000 people over the age of 50, those with lower vitamin D levels reported more depressive symptoms (for example, felt sad, felt lonely, couldn't get going). Those with the lowest vitamin D levels reported the greatest degree of depressive symptoms. Only small-scale studies have shown success in improving these symptoms by correcting the deficiency. Much more research is needed in this area to find out how best to treat it."" The link between the sun and cancer is typically not seen as a positive one because of the connection with skin cancer. UV-B radiation from the sun is said to be the most important environmental risk factor for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Because the sun is the primary source of vitamin D, researchers are looking to see what role it plays in skin cancer. Some believe that enough sun exposure to keep your vitamin D levels up, while protecting your skin from damage, is beneficial to skin cancer survival. There has also been research to show the protective effect that vitamin D has with the development of other cancers, including colon, breast, and prostate cancer. In 1941, U.S. pathologist Frank Apperly published geographic data that demonstrated for the first time an inverse correlation between levels of UV-B radiation in North America and mortality rates from cancers. This study suggested that more exposure to UV-B radiation led to fewer deaths from cancers. Since this was published, other studies have suggested that there may be an association between an increased risk of dying of various malignancies (for example, colon, breast, ovarian, melanoma, and prostate cancer) and living far from the equator. The anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D may also be able to assist with lowering pain levels in cancer patients when deficiencies are corrected. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increases in hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. The anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D may be the reason for this, and studies are ongoing to examine this relationship. A review of six studies that included over 6,400 people found that patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) had lower levels of vitamin D and that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to the development of more advanced PAD. Further research needs to be done to confirm the cause and effect."
What are vitamin D deficiency symptoms and signs? What are health risks of vitamin D deficiency? (Continued),"'Adequate vitamin D levels have also been linked with improvements in kidney function, ''erectile dysfunction'', ''sleep apnea'', ''diabetic retinopathy'', and decreased ''manic'' episodes in bipolar patients. There is ongoing research to determine links with vitamin D deficiency and the increase in the prevalence of ''asthma'' and ''allergies'', ''autism'', preterm birth, ''gestational diabetes'', and ''preeclampsia''.' It's possible that maintaining adequate vitamin D levels could lessen the length and severity of upper respiratory infections and possibly even prevent them from occurring in some people. A review of 12 studies, including 2,279 children, found that children with lower respiratory infections (LRTI) had significantly lower vitamin D levels compared with controls. There was also a relationship between the how low the level went and the incidence and severity of LRTI. The role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and surgical site infections is also being investigated. Many of the health benefits associated with vitamin D may come from its role in decreasing inflammation. Research has shown a decrease in levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, with increased levels of vitamin D. When there is an inability to properly absorb nutrients in the GI tract, there is a higher risk for nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin D's role goes beyond this in that the level of deficiency may impact the severity of IBD, and maintaining adequate levels may keep you in remission longer. There has even been evidence showing larger numbers of cases of IBD in northern latitudes suggesting it has a role in prevention, as well. A study including over 500 adults found that vitamin D deficiency was linked to greater fat mass, but only in those with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), suggesting the cause may lie in controlling that level. Vitamin D enhances the absorption of dietary calcium by 30%-40% and phosphorus by 80%. Without it, only 10%-15% of calcium and 60% of phosphorus is absorbed. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains blood calcium levels to enable normal mineralization of bone and prevent abnormally low blood calcium levels that can then lead to tetany. Vitamin D insufficiency leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism that causes increased bone loss, osteopenia, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk. Furthermore, moderate elevations of parathyroid hormones (PTH) may promote insulin resistance, weight gain, hypertension (high blood pressure), and left ventricular hypertrophy. Fall prevention is a public health goal for the elderly. Each year, one in three people 65 years and older experiences at least one fall, with 5.6% resulting in a fracture, and vitamin D can play a role in preventing this. There are vitamin D receptors in human muscle that have a direct effect on muscle strength. A severe vitamin D deficiency can cause myopathy, which can cause muscle weakness and pain. Vitamin D supplementation can reverse this and improve balance. Supplementing 700-1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 has been shown to possibly reduce falls by 19%-26%. Vitamin D3 at a dosage of greater than 800 IU/day given with calcium has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures by 10%-15%. Another advantage to correcting a vitamin D deficiency has been seen in decreasing knee and hip pain. A longitudinal population-based cohort study of 769 randomly selected older adults aged 50-80 years found that moderate vitamin D deficiency predicts the incidence or worsening of knee pain over five years and possibly hip pain over 2.4 years. Research has shown that those with blood vitamin D levels over 25 ng/mL had a 43% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those with levels under 14 ng/mL. Adequate vitamin D levels have been associated with improved blood sugar levels and decreased insulin resistance in some studies."
What causes a vitamin D deficiency?,"'A deficiency in vitamin D can result from inadequate exposure to sunlight, inefficient production in the skin, not enough vitamin D in your ''diet'', and health conditions that can affect it including, gastrointestinal disorders, renal diseases, and liver diseases.''Melanin'' is what gives skin its color. Light-skinned people have less ''melanin'"" than those with darker skin. Melanin is able to absorb UV-B radiation from the sun and reduce the skin's capacity to produce vitamin D3 by 95%-99%. Dark-skinned individuals have natural ""'sun protection'' and require at least three to five times longer exposures to make the same amount of vitamin D as a person with a white skin tone. African-Americans have a population mean serum 25(OH)D level of 16 ng/mL, whereas white Americans have a level of 26 ng/mL.''Being ''overweight'' or ''obese'' may put you at risk for a vitamin D deficiency. A recent review of 23 studies showed that ''obese'' subjects had 35% higher rates of vitamin D deficiency compared with normal weight subjects and 24% higher rates compared with ''overweight'' subjects. While ''diet'' and decreased sun exposure may have some impact on this, there appears to be an increased need that cannot be met without a supplement. One study tested the blood levels of vitamin D after sun exposure in both obese and non-obese subjects. Both saw an initial rise in vitamin D levels after similar exposures, but 24 hours later, there was 57% less vitamin D in the blood of the obese subjects. Both groups had a similar capacity of the skin to produce the vitamin. The difference was seen in the release of vitamin D from the skin into the circulation.'  "
What causes a vitamin D deficiency?  (Continued),"'You may look out your window and see the sun shining and think that you are safe from this deficiency, but that is not always the case. Even in sunny climates there is an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. We have all heard about the dangers of ''skin cancer'' and the need for ''sunscreen'' to protect us from this disease. This knowledge and the preventive actions we take have significantly decreased our vitamin D levels. Sunscreen protects so well against UV-B rays that an ''SPF'' of 30 decreases vitamin D synthesis in the skin by more than 95%. On top of this, we tend to spend more time indoors. One study found that it took Caucasians exposure of more than 30% of their body every day in the summer to make the optimal amounts of vitamin D. Most adults work indoors and wear more clothing during the work week, which leaves only about 10%-15% of their body exposed to UV for short periods, so they cannot meet their vitamin D needs through the sun alone. Even if you do have some exposure to the sun, the total amount of vitamin D you can produce is affected by the season, time of day, ozone amount, latitude, and number of clouds in the sky.''The important thing about using the sun for vitamin D production is to know that less is more. You are better off with short regular exposures to the sun rather than prolonged exposure for many reasons. The process is not as simple as the sun hitting your skin and vitamin D appearing in your blood. What actually happens is that vitamin D3 is first transformed by a process known as hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, often written as (25(OH)D3), and then again in the kidney to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, written as (1,25(OH)2D3). The level that is checked in your blood is 25-hydroxyvitamin D, often written as 25(OH)D, which includes vitamin D2 and D3. By staying in the sun, you limit this process and can actually get less vitamin D. You also have a lower risk of burning and damaging your skin with short exposures.''The National ''Cancer'' Council in Australia recently published a position paper on ways to minimize the risk of ''skin cancer'' while maintaining adequate vitamin D levels via exposure from the sun. Currently, one-third of the population there is deficient. Extended and deliberate sun exposure without any form of protection when the UV index is 3 or above is not recommended for anyone. When the UV index is below 3, ''sun protection'' is not recommended, and it is recommended that people be outdoors in the middle of the day with some skin uncovered on most days of the week.' "
Who is at risk for vitamin D deficiency?,"'Being that the sun is the primary source of vitamin D, your exposure, or lack of it, will impact your risk for a deficiency.''The Endocrine Society recommends screening and treatment for individuals at risk, including older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic ''fractures''; obese children and adults (''BMI'' > 30 kg/m2); African-American and Hispanic children and adults; ''pregnant'' and lactating women; and people with musculoskeletal diseases, chronic ''kidney disease'', hepatic failure, malabsorption syndromes, and some ''lymphomas''. Ongoing monitoring is recommended for the elderly, people with disabilities, and hospitalized people as they have been shown to have a significantly higher risk.''Research has begun to focus on who is deficient or insufficient in their vitamin D levels. Finding a deficiency does not mean that vitamin D is the cause of any ongoing symptoms. It simply means that there is a possible relationship, and more studies need to be done to clarify the relationship between vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and disease processes.''People with one of the fat malabsorption syndromes (for example, '""Crohn's disease""' or ''celiac disease'') and people who have had bariatric surgery are often unable to absorb enough of the fat-soluble vitamin D.'""Elderly: It has been shown that as we age our body has a decreased ability to synthesize vitamin D from exposure to the sun. There can be as much as 25% reduced production over the age of 70. While this can have an impact, it doesn't cause as much of a deficiency as the other risk factors.""'Children: A study done in Ethiopia found that schoolchildren between the ages of 11-18 years were more likely to be overweight or obese when they were deficient in vitamin D. Another study of 301 students aged 11-19 years found that 12% of the students were deficient, and 53% had insufficiency. It also found that as body weight increased (measured by ''BMI'') the level of vitamin D decreased.''A wide variety of medications, including antifungal medications, anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, and medications to treat ''AIDS''/''HIV'', can enhance the breakdown of vitamin D and lead to low levels.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a vitamin D deficiency?,"""All it takes is a simple blood test to find out if you are deficient in vitamin D, but you need to have the correct test done and at the correct time of year. There are two blood tests for vitamin D. One is for a compound called 1,25(OH)2D. This is one is not a good measure for your current vitamin D level. It has a short half-life and can be impacted by your parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorus levels, so it's not a true measure of your vitamin D status. The preferred test is the 25-hydroxyvitamin D, written as 25(OH)D. This is the most accurate measure of your current vitamin D status as it reflects what you get from your ""'diet'', ''supplements'', and the sun. It is also the one that the majority of the research studies measure. As with the guidelines for how much to consume, there are also two sets of guidelines for what your blood level should be. One is written by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the other by the task force for the Endocrine Society. These levels are for serum (blood) 25(OH)D:''The largest meta-analysis ever conducted on all of the published studies between 1966 and 2013 regarding 25(OH)D levels and all-cause mortality found that the lowest mortality (death) risk is seen when the levels are >40 ng/mL. According to this, the IOM guidelines are too low and there is a plea calling on the public health authorities to change the recommendations for both the ideal blood level and the requirements needed to achieve this level.''Your 25(OH)D level will change by seasons if you vary how much time you spend in the sun each season. Keep this in mind when scheduling your test.'  "
What is the treatment for a vitamin D deficiency?,"'The amount of vitamin D that is needed to correct a deficiency will depend on the severity of the deficiency and your individual medical conditions. The time of year will also impact your needs. For example, if you are on the low end of adequate blood levels and heading in to the winter months you would need a bit more than if you were heading in to the summer months if you spend time out in the sun. The goal for everyone is to get your stores to a safe level and prevent them from dropping with a maintenance plan.''Vitamin D3 has been shown to be the best choice for supplements. Vitamin D2 supplements do not raise your levels the same amount as D3 and, in some cases, they have been shown to decrease levels over long-term use. Natural sources of vitamin D2 are scarce, and the majority of research has been done using D3 supplements.''What you take is as important as how you take it. Vitamin D supplements should be taken with a meal that contains fat. Studies have shown that when taken on an empty stomach versus with a meal containing fat, there was an average of 32% more vitamin D absorption in the fat-containing meal. This ranged from 11%-52%. Even an 11% reduction is significant and can impact your vitamin level. A recent study instructed people to take their supplement with their largest meal (typically the one with the most fat), and in three months, their blood levels went up an average of 56.7%.'""There are supplements that can be taken on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. It's a matter of preference and, most importantly, which one you will be more likely to take. When you are deficient, it is recommended to have your blood tested after two to three months of taking the supplement to be sure that your levels are going up. Work with your doctors to find the optimal plan for you.""'The task force for the Endocrine Society makes the following recommendations:'   For children 1-18 years of age who are vitamin D deficient, we suggest treatment with 2,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for at least six weeks or with 50,000 IU once a week for at least six weeks to achieve a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 600-1,000 IU/day. We suggest that all adults who are vitamin D deficient be treated with 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 once a week for eight weeks or its equivalent of 6,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily to achieve a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 1,500-2,000 IU/day. In obese patients, patients with malabsorption syndromes, and patients on medications affecting vitamin D metabolism, we suggest a higher dose (two to three times higher; at least 6,000-10,000 IU/day) of vitamin D to treat vitamin D deficiency to maintain a 25(OH)D level above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 3,000-6,000IU/day. One study found that for every 33 lbs. of body weight the serum 25(OH)D level was 4 ng/mL lower at the end of one year of monitoring. This could lead to a significant change in the amount required to supplement based on your body weight and starting serum level. African-Americans: The population mean serum 25(OH)D level has been shown to be lower in African-Americans than whites, but supplementation has been shown to be as effective in this population."
Is it possible to prevent vitamin D deficiency?,"""A few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and other foods are fortified with it. With only 20% of our vitamin D intake expected from food, exposure to the sun and taking supplements remain the primary sources. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for supplementing on a regular basis, get some sun exposure, consume foods that contain vitamin D, have regular blood work to monitor your level, and make adjustments to your intake based on your medical needs and seasonal changes."" 1 tsp cod liver oil has 400 to 1,000 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz salmon, fresh (wild) has 600 to 1,000 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz salmon, fresh (farmed) has 100 to 250 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz salmon, canned has 300 to 600 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz sardines, canned has about 300 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz mackerel, canned has about 250 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz tuna, canned has 236 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz shiitake mushrooms (fresh) has about 100 IU/vitamin D 3.5 oz shiitake mushrooms (sun-dried) has about 1,600 IU/vitamin D 1 egg yolk has about 20 IU/vitamin D 8 oz fortified milk or yogurt has 100 IU/vitamin D 8 oz fortified orange juice has about 100 IU/vitamin D 3 oz fortified cheese has about 100 IU/vitamin D"
What are symptoms and signs of an excessive vitamin D intake (Daily Limits Chart)?,"'There have never been warnings about getting too much vitamin D from the sun so many do not realize that there is such a thing as too much vitamin D. There are negative health consequences from too much vitamin D, but this can only happen with excessive doses of supplements. A Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) has been set to avoid any issues, but there is some controversy about how much is too much. A blood level above 150 ng/mL appears to be the point at which problems occur, but some suggest that levels above 120 ng/mL should be the cap. Potential problems are ''hypercalcemia'' (''elevated calcium'' in the blood, causing ''weakness'', ''confusion'', ''constipation'', ''loss of appetite'' and painful calcium deposits), hypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine), and hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate levels in the blood). Over the long term, the elevated blood levels of calcium can lead to vascular and tissue calcification, with subsequent damage to the ''heart'', blood vessels, and kidneys. Research has shown that very high doses of vitamin D can actually increase the risk of falls and fractures. A study of 2,256 community-dwelling women, aged 70 years or older, found that over five years those given very high doses of vitamin D experienced 15% more falls and 26% more fractures than those in the placebo group.''The current UL set for vitamin D supplements is as follows:''The arguments against these upper limit levels stem from the fact that you can get 10,000-25,000 IU from exposure to the sun in one day. The IOM states that excessive sun exposure does not result in vitamin D toxicity because the sustained heat on the skin is thought to photodegrade vitamin D3 as it is being formed. Studies have shown that long-term supplementation over 10,000 IU/day can cause kidney and tissue damage, but this would only occur over a long period of time. One study reports that you would need to consume 50,000 IU/day over several months to reach toxicity blood levels. A recent study found that high-dose vitamin D supplementation (20,000-40,000 IU/week) caused a slight but significant increase in ''hemoglobin A1C'' and ''C-reactive protein'', and a decrease in serum ''HDL'' (""good"" ''cholesterol''). The best way to avoid any issues is to take appropriate levels to correct a deficiency or insufficiency and have your blood checked after a few months and then decrease to maintenance levels once you have reached the correct level.''There is no disputing the fact that vitamin D plays many crucial roles in our well-being, and many of us have either deficient or inefficient blood levels. An affordable, convenient way to test vitamin D levels, similar to finger-sticks used for blood ''sugar'' testing, can play a vital role correcting low blood levels. Changes to our lifestyle, diet, and regular supplementation are the keys to curbing the vitamin D deficiency pandemic.' "
"Homocysteine, folic acid, and B vitamins","'Homocysteine'' is an amino acid that plays a role in ''coronary artery disease''. It is metabolized (chemically transformed) into methionine and cysteine with the help of the B ''vitamins''; ''folic acid'' (B9), B12, and B6 (''pyridoxine''). Therefore, insufficient amounts of these B ''vitamins'' in the body can theoretically hamper the metabolic breakdown of homocysteine, and hence increase its blood levels. High levels of homocysteine in the blood (''hyperhomocysteinemia'') can damage the inner surface of blood vessels, promote blood clotting, and accelerate ''atherosclerosis''.''The current state of knowledge regarding folic acid, homocysteine, and ''heart attacks'' is as follows:''Even though current scientific evidence suggests that taking folic acid and vitamin B ''supplements'' to lower homocysteine levels should help prevent atherosclerosis and ''heart attacks'', conclusive proof is still lacking because:''There is also no official recommendation as to who should be tested for hyperhomocysteinemia. The optimal doses of the B vitamins, folic acid, B12, and B6, required to prevent and treat hyperhomocysteinemia are also uncertain. For folic acid, a daily dose of 0.8-1.0 mg is probably adequate.'  The level of blood folate is an important determinant of the blood homocysteine level. Low blood folate levels are associated with high blood levels of homocysteine.  Low blood folate is common among individuals who do not take multivitamins, but unusual among those who do.  The consumption of folic acid supplements or folic acid fortified cereals can increase blood folate levels and decrease blood homocysteine levels. In a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of multivitamins) had fewer heart attacks than those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. There are no conclusive controlled studies demonstrating that increasing folic acid intake actually prevents atherosclerosis and heart attacks.  There is no clinical study demonstrating that lowering blood levels of homocysteine actually prevents atherosclerosis and heart attacks."
What about antioxidants for heart attack prevention?,"'Antioxidants are food supplements that have been promoted as preventing ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. An important early event in the development of a cholesterol plaque in atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of ''LDL cholesterol'' (low density lipoprotein) particles in the blood and the subsequent interaction of this modified LDL with the wall of the coronary artery. This process initiates the formation of the cholesterol plaque.''Antioxidants that block the oxidative modification of LDL have been shown to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in animal experiments. Examples of antioxidants include ''vitamin E'' and beta carotene. In humans, observational studies (studies that observe the frequency of related conditions) have found a relationship between the dietary intake of vitamin E and lower rates of heart attacks.''Observational studies provide only circumstantial evidence, however, and credible evidence is obtained only by way of controlled trials (discussed at the beginning of this article). Several controlled trials performed to date have yielded conflicting results on the benefits of antioxidant therapy. These results may possibly be due to the low doses of vitamin E used, the small number of patients in the study, or the limited duration of treatment.''The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study used a high dose (400 IU per day) of vitamin E over a span of five years in patients with significant risk factors for ''heart disease'' or ''stroke''. This study found no difference in the occurrence of heart attack or ''stroke'' in the group treated with vitamin E versus those given the placebo. This study demonstrated that antioxidant therapy does not have any benefit in persons who have or are at high risk for having atherosclerosis.' "
How about exercise for heart attack prevention?,"'Studies of the effects of ''exercise'' in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. This is likely due to the fact that people who ''exercise'' regularly generally have healthier lifestyles and that many risk factors for ''heart disease'' can be influenced by exercise. Therefore, the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate. For example, regular exercise has direct effects on ''weight control'', ''blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', blood cholesterol, and ''smoking''.'

 "
What about smoking cessation for heart attack prevention?,"'Smoking cessation'', by whatever means, has been clearly demonstrated to reduce future heart attacks and death in patients with known ''coronary artery disease'' or who have other risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. While many methods, both chemical and behavioral, have been used to aid ''smoking'' cessation, the initial success rate is often low, and the relapse rate is high. Certain medications that affect neurotransmitters in the brain, which are similar to agents often used to treat ''depression'' [for example, ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'', Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, ''Zyban'')], have recently been demonstrated to be helpful in many patients trying to stop ''smoking''. While effective, these agents may produce significant side effects and should only be used under the close supervision of a doctor. ' "
Recommendations to prevent heart attacks," Eat whole, natural, and fresh foods. Eat five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables daily and eat more peas, beans, and nuts.  Increase intake of omega-3 fatty acids by eating more fish, walnuts, flaxseed oil, and green leafy vegetables. An example of meeting the recommended intake of omega-3 fats is to eat 2 salmon portions a week or 1 gram of omega-3-fatty acid supplement daily. Drink water, tea, non-fat dairy and red wine (two drinks or less daily for men, one drink or less daily for women). Eat lean protein such as skinless poultry, fish, and lean cuts of red meat.  Avoid trans-fats and limit intake of saturated fats. This means avoiding fried foods, hard margarine, commercial baked goods, and most packaged and processed snack foods, high fat dairy and processed meats such as bacon, sausage, and deli meats. Limit glycemic foods. Glycemic foods are those made with sugar and white flour, which increase blood sugar levels. Increased blood sugar levels stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Chronically high insulin levels are believed to cause weight gain as well as atherosclerosis of the arteries. Exercise daily. Understand your risk factors and research in this area. For example, the Framingham Heart Study recruited residents of Framingham, Massachusetts beginning around 1948 and followed the group in an attempt to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to heart attack or stroke."
"What are vitamins, and why are they important?","'There are six basic types of nutrients that are considered essential to life: proteins, carbohydrates, ''fats'', ''vitamins'', ''minerals'', and water. These nutrients are needed for your body to function properly, and your ''diet'"" is the source of them. Vitamins and minerals are considered micronutrients because they are needed in smaller quantities than the macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat). Micronutrients do not provide calories. When your body does not absorb an adequate amount of any of the micronutrients, diseases can occur. It's important to understand what your nutritional needs are and how to achieve them.""'Vitamins are broken down into two categories: water-soluble and fat-soluble. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts are not stored and will leave your body through your urine. For this reason, you must consume them on a continuous basis. The water-soluble vitamins are the B vitamins and ''vitamin C''. Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in fat, not water. These vitamins need dietary fat in order to be better absorbed in the small ''intestines''. They are then stored in the ''liver'' and fatty tissues (adipose tissues) and can accumulate to toxic levels when consumed in excess quantities. The fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K.''Recommendations for essential nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Dietary Reference Intakes is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intake for healthy people. There are three important types of DRI reference values; Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), Adequate Intakes (AI), and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL). The RDA is set to meet the nutrient requirements for the average daily intake of nearly all healthy individuals in each age and gender group. When there is insufficient data to set an RDA for a nutrient, an AI is set. AIs meet or exceed the amount needed to maintain an adequate nutritional state in nearly everyone of a specific age and gender group. Some nutrients can cause health problems when consumed in excessive quantities. The UL was set to provide the maximum daily intake that is unlikely to result in adverse health effects. Numerous health conditions, however, can impact your nutritional needs. A registered dietitian or physician can help you better determine your needs based upon your overall health and condition.'  "
Calcium,"""Most people know that calcium is needed for strong bones, but it's also needed to help blood vessels and muscles contract and expand, to send messages through the nervous system, and to secrete hormones and enzymes. This is the most abundant mineral in your body and makes up 1%-2% of adult ""'human body'' weight. Over 99% of it is stored in bones and ''teeth'' with the rest stored in blood, muscle, and other tissues.''There is a great deal of concern over Americans not meeting the recommendations for calcium intake. The recommendations for calcium are listed as an Adequate Intake:''*''Breast milk'' has been shown to have a higher rate of calcium absorption than formula, so calcium requirements are higher for formula-based diets. Calcium needs during ''pregnancy'' and lactation do not change from ages 14 to 50.''Calcium is found in a variety of foods, but the amount that your body absorbs varies. Oxalic acid and phytic acid both interfere with the absorption of calcium. Foods rich in oxalic acid are spinach, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, and beans. Foods rich in phytic acid are unleavened bread, nuts, seeds, and raw beans. You will absorb some of the calcium in these foods, but not as much as you would from foods that do not contain oxalic acid or phytic acid. For example, calcium absorption from dried beans is about half of what you absorb from milk, and calcium absorption from spinach is about one-tenth of that absorbed from milk. There is no need to omit these foods from your ''diet''. Instead, consume a variety of calcium-rich foods throughout the day.''According to the USDA Nutrient Database, the calcium content of some common foods is shown below:''You can also increase your calcium intake by''A well-balanced diet can be enough to reach your recommended intake of calcium. When diet is not enough, a calcium supplement may be necessary. In the case of calcium ''supplements'', more is definitely not better. Calcium absorption is most efficient when the dose is 500 mg or less. This means that taking 1,000 mg at one time is less effective than taking two separate doses of 500 mg.''Calcium exists in nature combined with other chemicals. These compounds are what you will find in ''supplements'' and include ''calcium carbonate'', calcium phosphate, calcium lactate, and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate is the most common one because it is inexpensive and convenient. People who have decreased stomach acid (for example, older adults and those who take antacids) are better off taking calcium citrate. According to the National ''Osteoporosis'' Foundation, ""Calcium supplements prepared from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite may contain lead or other toxic metals,"" so you need to pay attention to the source of calcium in your supplement.''Calcium supplements may cause ''gas'', ''bloating'', and/or ''constipation''. There may be options to help relieve this. You can try spreading out dosages of the supplement throughout the day, try taking it with food, try a different brand, or speak with your doctor or pharmacist for assistance.'""Bone is a living tissue that constantly breaks down and builds back up. Up until around the age of 30, consuming an adequate amount of calcium with enough physical activity ensures that your body builds more bone than it breaks down. The majority of adult bone mass is acquired by age 18 in girls and 20 in boys. After that, breakdown typically exceeds the amount of bone being built. For this reason, it's essential to maximize bone stores when it's still possible. The amount that you lose after age 30 will be impacted by genetics, ethnicity, physical activity level, sex hormone levels, diet, and gender. You can replace what you lose with the foods you eat and your activity level, but you can't increase how much you store. When bone mass drops and there is a deterioration of bone tissue, ""'osteoporosis'' can occur. ''Osteoporosis'' causes bones to be susceptible to ''fractures''. Depending on the severity of the damage, bones can break from a minor fall, or in severe cases, from ''sneezing''.''Other factors can put you at risk for low calcium levels.''Amenorrhea'': Research has shown that young women who do not get their period due to ''anorexia nervosa'' have reduced net calcium absorption, higher urinary calcium excretion, and a lower rate of bone formation in comparison to those who menstruate regularly. Reduced calcium retention and lower bone mass have also been seen in ''exercise''-induced amenorrhea.''Lactose intolerance'': Many people find that consuming dairy products causes bloating, gas, cramping, and/or ''diarrhea'"". This is often from your body's inability to break down the lactose found in dairy foods. Lactose is the ""'sugar'' that naturally occurs in these foods. Avoiding dairy foods can put you at risk for ''calcium deficiency'"". Fortunately, there are things that you can do to help with these symptoms. The first thing is to try to consume smaller amounts of dairy foods. Studies have shown that lactose intolerance is dose-dependent and different people have the intolerance at different levels of severity. When this doesn't work, you can purchase dairy products that have the lactose broken down for you. Lactaid products have taken the lactose and broken it up so that your body does not have to.""'The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for calcium for children and adults ages 1 year and older is 2,500 mg/day. Excessively high intakes would have to come from supplements alone or supplements in combination with dietary sources. The dangers of excessive consumption are impaired kidney function, ''hypercalcemia'"", and decreased absorption of other minerals (iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus). Calcium has been shown to interfere with iron absorption. It's best to take the recommended amounts of calcium separate from iron-containing foods or supplements.""'Calcium also has the potential to interact with medications by decreasing the absorption of the medication. Some affected medications are ''digoxin'', fluoroquinolones, levothyroxine, antibiotics in ''tetracycline'' family, and ''phenytoin''. Your doctor and pharmacist can provide further information about this.'   adding nonfat powdered milk to cereals (hot and cold), soups, gravy, baked goods, or casseroles, using nonfat milk in place of water in recipes (pancakes, pudding, hot cereals, and mashed potatoes), and having yogurt dips for vegetable and chips."
Vitamin D,"'Vitamin D'' is probably most well-known for being the ""sunshine vitamin."" The ultraviolet rays from sunlight striking the skin, causing ''vitamin D'"" to be made. It can also be found in food and supplements. This is one of the four fat-soluble vitamins. That means that it's stored in the body's fatty tissue and can build up to toxic levels with excessive consumption. The current thinking, however, is that the potential toxicity of ""'vitamin D'' has been exaggerated in the past and it is safe overall.''The major function of vitamin D is to maintain optimal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. Studies have shown that it provides protection from ''hypertension'', ''cancer'', ''osteoporosis'', ''type 1 diabetes'', and several autoimmune diseases.''The recommendations for vitamin D are listed as an Adequate Intake in micrograms (mcg) and International Units (IU):''15 mcg (600 IU)''20 mcg (800 IU)''The sunshine vitamin got its name from the fact that the sun helps our body produce vitamin D. The concern about ''skin cancer'' has caused many people to avoid unprotected exposure to the sun. Fortunately, it is possible to consume enough vitamin D in your diet, so it is not necessary to risk the dangers of ''skin cancer'' by exposing yourself to the sun. For those who do rely on the sun as one of their sources, there are many factors that will impact how much you need. The season, time of day, cloud coverage, smog, amount and ''SPF'' of ''sunscreen'', geographic latitude, and ''melanin'' content of your skin are all possible barriers. It can take anywhere from five to 30 minutes of sun on unexposed skin between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at least twice a week.''The foods that naturally contain vitamin D are seafood, mushrooms, and egg yolks. Dietary sources of vitamin D are:''When diet is not enough, you may need to take a supplement to help you reach the desired intake of vitamin D. As you will see, vitamin D can be toxic at high levels, so the goal is to reach the appropriate level, not exceed it.''The two primary types of vitamin D supplements are vitamin D2 (''ergocalciferol'') and vitamin D3 (''cholecalciferol''). Most experts believe that vitamin D3 is the ideal choice for these reasons:''You can have blood tests done to determine if you are deficient in vitamin D. Your 25(OH)D level will be measured. Most experts agree that 25(OH)D level below <20 ng/mL represents ''vitamin D deficiency'', whereas a 25(OH)D level below 20 ng/mL is an indication of ''vitamin D deficiency''.''Research has shown strong relationships between lower rates of chronic diseases and higher levels of vitamin D. The most well-known disease related to ''vitamin D deficiency'' is ''rickets''. ''Rickets'' is the disease that was found to be cured by consuming cod liver oil in the early 20th century. Rickets causes soft, weak bones in children, resulting in skeletal deformities (bowed legs), impaired growth, bone ''pain'', dental problems, and fragile bones. Unfortunately, rickets has still been seen in children not being fed an adequate amount of vitamin D. In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteoporosis and osteomalacia (both are conditions of weakened bones).''There are several other factors that can contribute to a deficiency in vitamin D:''Age'': People over 50 years old have a decreased ability to synthesize and absorb vitamin D. This occurs regardless of the amount of sun exposure time.''Medical conditions'"": Vitamin D requires fat for absorption, so anyone with a medical condition that reduces the ability to absorb dietary fat can be at risk for a deficiency. It is important to have vitamin D levels monitored in people with conditions such as Crohn's disease, ""'celiac disease'', ''cystic fibrosis'', pancreatic enzyme deficiency, and surgical removal of any part of the stomach or intestines.''Obesity'': Research has shown lower vitamin D concentrations in ''overweight'' and ''obese'' individuals. One possible reason for this is that vitamin D gets absorbed by fat tissue and is not easily absorbed in the bloodstream.''Sun exposure'': The ultraviolet rays from the sun have served as a source of vitamin D over the years. Due to the danger of ''skin cancer'', many people have cut back on their exposure to the sun and have begun using sunscreen when they are being exposed, so this can contribute to lower levels if adjustments are not made to compensate for this loss via dietary sources and/or supplements.''Skin pigmentation'': There is more melanin in darker-skinned individuals. Melanin blocks the ultraviolet rays and interferes with vitamin D synthesis.''Consuming excessive amount of vitamin D can pose health problems. This is most likely to occur from taking supplements or high doses of cod liver oil. There is no danger of vitamin D toxicity from sun exposure. Symptoms of toxicity can be ''nausea'', poor appetite, ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''constipation'', and high blood levels of calcium. A blood level of over 200 ng/mL for vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D, can be potentially toxic. For this reason, the tolerable upper intake (UL) for vitamin D has been set at 2,000 IU (50 mcg) per day for ages 1 and above. The UL for birth to 12 months is 1,000 IU (25 mcg) per day.'   Vitamin D3 is the most potent form, it's more stable on the shelf, and it's less toxic than D2. Vitamin D3 is the one that is synthesized when the sun hits your skin, so it's considered to be the most natural. Most of the research that has been done on vitamin D and its health benefits has used vitamin D3."
Folic Acid,"'Folic acid'"" is the man-made form of folate, a naturally occurring B vitamin. Because it's a water-soluble vitamin, it cannot be stored in the body so it needs to be supplied on a continuous basis.""'Folic acid helps form and maintain new cells. It is needed to make ''red blood cells'' and for the metabolism of ''homocysteine''. It helps produce DNA, and it helps prevent changes in DNA that may lead to ''cancer''.''The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate are expressed in a term called Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE). The naturally occurring folate is absorbed differently than the man-made folic acid, so the DFE was developed to help account for these differences. One DFE is equal to 1 microgram (mcg) of food folate and 0.6 mcg of folic acid from supplements and fortified foods.''The RDA for folate:''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for folate for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''Folate can be found naturally in many foods, including fruits, leafy green vegetables, and dried beans. Folic acid is added to certain foods because of regulations published by the Food and Drug Administration in 1996. These foods are considered enriched because the folic acid is replacing the folate that was lost during processing. Some common folic acid-enriched foods are cereals, breads, pasta, rice, flours, and cornmeal. Folic acid can also be added to foods and ''beverages'' in addition to the nutrients that they already contain. These foods are considered fortified with folic acid. In 1998, the folic acid fortification program was initiated to help Americans reach their folic acid recommendations.'' Food sources of folate and folic acid are:''The goal is to consume a balanced diet that provides your daily folate needs. The folate-enriched and -fortified foods make this much easier to accomplish. When you have a medical condition that interferes with the amount that you can consume, if you are unable to absorb all of what you consume, if your diet is limited, or if you have an increased need for folate, a supplement would be the best option. It is recommended that women who may become ''pregnant'' take 400 mcg of folic acid from fortified foods and/or dietary supplements along with consuming a well-balanced diet.''Another possible reason to take a supplement would be for ''heart'' protection. There are some studies that have shown that folic acid can lower homocysteine levels by up to 25%. High blood levels of homocysteine can damage the inner surface of blood vessels, promote blood clotting, accelerate ''atherosclerosis'', and thus lead to ''heart attacks'' and ''strokes''.''One very severe consequence of not getting enough folic acid is the possibility of ''neural tube defects'"" during pregnancy. Neural tube defects usually develop in the first 28 days of pregnancy. Many women do not know that they are pregnant during this time and are not monitoring their folic acid intake. For this reason, it's a good idea to make sure that you have an adequate daily intake before ""'trying to conceive''.''A deficiency in folate can lead to megaloblastic (or macrocytic) ''anemia''. It may also cause poor growth, gray hair, glossitis, ''mouth ulcers'', ''diarrhea'', and peptic ulcers. Studies have shown that low blood folate levels are associated with high blood homocysteine levels. High blood levels of homocysteine can damage the inner surface of blood vessels, promote blood clotting, accelerate atherosclerosis, and thus lead to ''heart attacks'' and strokes.''There are medical conditions and medications that can increase the need for folate, increase its excretion, or interfere with its utilization:'""It's best to speak with your doctor if any of these applies to you.""'There is no Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) set for natural sources of folate found in food.''There are UL set for folate from fortified foods and supplements.''Going above the UL increases your risk for adverse health effects.' pregnancy and lactation, liver disease, kidney dialysis, malabsorption, alcohol abuse, triamterene, barbiturates, anticonvulsant medications, sulfasalazine, metformin, and methotrexate."
Vitamin E,"'Vitamin E'' represents a family of eight fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins. Each form has its own function. Alpha-tocopherol is the most important E vitamin in humans. Vitamin E is involved in maintaining cell integrity, and it protects ''vitamin A'' and essential fatty acids from oxidation in the body cells.''The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for vitamin E is based on the alpha-tocopherol form. The recommendations below are in milligrams (mg) and International Units (IU). You can use the milligrams when looking at the content in food and the International Units when looking at the content in supplements.''The RDA for vitamin E is:''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for vitamin E for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''There are many foods rich in vitamin E. The most common ones are fortified cereals, green leafy vegetables, vegetable oil, eggs, and nuts. The content of vitamin E in food is based on the alpha-tocopherol content:''Most research shows that we do not consume an adequate amount of vitamin E, but a deficiency is rare.  According to the USDA, the intake of vitamin E by women 19 to 50 years is less than 90% of the RDA. The average consumption for American adults is 7 to 9 mg compared to the recommended 15 mg. There is, however, a possibility that we are consuming more than we think. Many people under-report their fat intake, so there is a chance that you are reaching your recommended amount of vitamin E if you do consume a large amount of the oils that contain it. Unfortunately, the amount of oil that it would take to reach the recommendations is high, and with that comes a lot of calories. It would be best to consume a variety of the foods that contain vitamin E with limited amounts of oil and take a supplement for what you are missing.''There is some evidence that vitamin E supplements help protect against ''heart disease'', but this evidence is controversial. In a study of approximately 90,000 nurses, the incidence of ''heart disease'' was 30%-40% lower in those with the highest intake of vitamin E from supplements, not from food. This study was looking at what happened to these nurses without any kind of intervention. The studies that gave people vitamin E supplements have not seen any protection against ''heart disease''. The reason for the difference is still unclear, so there is more research being done to determine what role vitamin E plays in protecting against heart disease. At this time, the American Heart Association does not recommend antioxidant ''vitamins -- including'' ''vitamin E -- for'' preventing ''cardiovascular disease''.''Some ''cancers'' develop from oxidation damage to DNA. In the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene (ATBC) study, scientists found a 32% reduction in the incidence of ''prostate cancer'' among subjects taking alpha-tocopherol supplements compared to those not taking the vitamin. However, several studies have found no benefit of vitamin E in preventing lung and breast cancers. More randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effect of vitamin E on ''cancer'' risks.'""Alzheimer's""' disease is a degenerative brain disease with progressive loss of mental capacity, thought in part to be due to oxidation. High doses of alpha-tocopherol supplementation in one study slowed the progression of '""Alzheimer's"""" disease. Although these results are promising, large-scale placebo-controlled prospective trials will be required to determine the role of a-tocopherol supplementation in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.""'When purchasing vitamin E supplements, you will see that they are often sold as alpha-tocopheryl acetate. This form of alpha-tocopherol protects its ability to function as an antioxidant. A ""DL"" on the label means that it\'s the synthetic form and is about half as active as the natural form, which is listed as ""D.""''Dietary vitamin E deficiency is common in developing countries and among people with fat-malabsorption diseases. The main symptoms are hemolytic ''anemia'' and neurologic deficits.''Vitamin E can act as an ''anticoagulant'', which means that it can increase the risk of bleeding problems. This means that people taking ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'"") should not take vitamin E supplements without their doctor's approval. The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) was set at the highest dose unlikely to result in bleeding problems.""'There are UL set for vitamin E:' "
Vitamin A,"'Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is broken down into two categories: preformed vitamin A comes from animal foods, and provitamin A carotenoid comes from plant foods.''Vitamin A serves many functions:''The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for vitamin A are listed as International Units (IU) of Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE). This is done to account for the different actions of both forms of vitamin A.''RDA for vitamin A:''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for vitamin A for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''Vitamin A can be found in animal and plant foods. The animal food sources are better absorbed and used by the body than the plant sources. There are also many foods that are fortified and enriched with vitamin A.''The content of vitamin A in animal and plant foods (from beta-carotene):''Vitamin A is stored in the liver, so there is a supply that can be used during short-term periods when intake is not adequate to meet your needs. People with medical conditions that interfere with the absorption of vitamin A may need to take a supplement. These conditions include ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'inflammatory bowel disease'"", and pancreatic disorders. Because vitamin A can be toxic at high levels, it's best to discuss supplements with your physician.""'Early vitamin A deficiency leads to impaired night vision, and advanced vitamin A deficiency can lead to corneal ulcers, xerophthalamia (''dry eye''), scarring, night ''blindness'' or total blindness. In developing countries, vitamin A deficiency is an important cause of blindness among children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are also more likely to develop ''diarrhea'' and respiratory infections than children who are not vitamin A deficient. Vitamin A deficiency is rare among healthy adults in the United States.'""Vitamin A deficiency can also be a problem for people with Crohn's disease, ""'celiac disease'', pancreatic disorders, and people who do not consume animal foods.''When excess amounts of vitamin A are being stored in your body, the condition is called hypervitaminosis A. The harmful effects of hypervitaminosis A are ''birth defects'', reduced ''bone density'' that may result in osteoporosis, central nervous system disorders, and liver abnormalities.''Acute vitamin A toxicity may result from consuming very large quantities of vitamin A over a short period of time. The symptoms are ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', irritability, drowsiness, ''altered mental status'', ''anorexia'', ''abdominal pain'', ''blurred vision'', ''muscle pain'' with weakness, and/or ''headache''. Elderly people and people who drink ''alcohol'' heavily are more susceptible to vitamin A toxicity.''The Institute of Medicine states that ""beta-carotene supplements are not advisable for the general population,"" although they also state that this advice ""does not pertain to the possible use of supplemental beta-carotene as a provitamin A source for the ''prevention'' of vitamin A deficiency in populations with inadequate vitamin A.""''The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for vitamin A is:''In the ATBC trial, subjects given beta-carotene had a higher incidence of ''lung cancer'' than subjects not given beta-carotene.

Vitamin C,"'Vitamin C, also known as ''ascorbic acid'"", is a water-soluble antioxidant vitamin. Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen and dentin. Collagen is the structural component of blood vessels, bones, ligaments, and tendons, while dentin is the structural component of teeth. Vitamin C is also an effective antioxidant that protects proteins and genetic materials (RNA and DNA) from damage by free radicals. Vitamin C cannot be made or stored by your body, so it's important to consume a well-balanced diet containing vitamin C.""'There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for vitamin C for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C is:''All fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C, so consuming a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is the key.''''Many people believe that taking vitamin C will help prevent colds. Research has not shown this to be the case. More than 30 ''clinical trials'' that included over 10,000 participants have not found any relationship between vitamin C and a reduced risk of colds. There has been a small reduction in the duration of colds, so paying attention to your vitamin C intake once you have the cold is advisable.''Research has shown that vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron. For this reason, anyone who needs an iron supplement is usually advised to take it with a food that is high in vitamin C or with a vitamin C supplement. Iron can be toxic at high levels, so speak with your doctor before taking any supplements.''There is an increased need for vitamin C for individuals who smoke. There is an additional 35 mg/day requirement for ''smokers'' versus nonsmokers. This can be achieved with dietary sources or a supplement.''Scurvy'' is a severe deficiency of vitamin C. It would be uncommon for most of us, but it can be found in someone who is malnourished. Less severe deficiencies can occur. Not consuming an adequate amount of vitamin C can lead to symptoms, including feeling weak, tired, and irritable, having dry and splitting hair, ''bleeding gums'', rough, dry, and scaly skin, ''gingivitis'', ''easy bruising'', anemia, and a decreased ability to fight infection.''Vitamin C is generally safe. Large doses of vitamin C may cause stomach upset and diarrhea in adults and have been reported to cause ''kidney stones''. There is also a risk of excess iron absorption with high doses of vitamin C.' "
Vitamin B12,"'Vitamin B12 is needed for producing and maintaining new cells, including nerve cells and red blood cells. It is also needed to help make DNA.''Vitamin B12 is bound to the proteins in food. Once you consume B12, the hydrochloric acid in your stomach releases the B12 from the protein. B12 then combines with a substance called intrinsic factor to be absorbed by the intestines.''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for vitamin B12 for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12 is:''Vitamin B12 is attached to the proteins in animal foods. Breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B12, which is very important for people who do not consume an adequate amount of animal foods.''Studies reveal that the majority of Americans consume an adequate amount of vitamin B12. People who do not consume meat or who have a stomach or intestinal disorder that interferes with absorption may need to take a vitamin B12 supplement. Older adults may have atrophic ''gastritis'' and may need to consume additional food sources and/or supplements. There are also some medications that can influence vitamin B12 absorption, including H2 receptor antagonists used to treat peptic ulcers, metformin, and ''proton pump inhibitors''. Your doctor can determine your vitamin B12 levels with a blood test.''An inadequate amount of vitamin B12 can cause ''pernicious anemia''. Signs of vitamin B12 deficiency are ''fatigue'', ''constipation'', weakness, ''loss of appetite'', ''weight loss'', and numbness and tingling in the hands and ''feet''. You may also experience a difficulty in maintaining balance, ''confusion'', ''dementia'', ''depression'"", and poor memory. An excess intake of folate can mask the symptoms of B12 deficiency, so it's important to have your levels checked with blood tests if there is a concern, especially if you consume a ""'vegetarian'' diet.''Currently, there is no Tolerable Upper Limit set for vitamin B12. This does not mean that consuming excessive amounts will provide any additional health benefits. It means that there is a very low potential for toxicity at high levels. ' "
Vitamin B6,"'What is vitamin B6, and what does it do?''Vitamin B6 is one of the water-soluble B vitamins. It comes in three forms: ''pyridoxine'', pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine.

The requirements for vitamin B6 can easily be met with a well-balanced diet. When your diet is limited in variety, you may need to take a supplement. Older adults and alcoholics are people whose diets may be lacking and require supplementation. Studies have shown that supplementing with large doses of vitamin B6 can increase the immune response in critically ill patients.''In the early 1950s, an error in the manufacturing of baby formula lead to vitamin B6 deficiencies and caused ''seizures'' in the infants who were deficient in it. Other symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency are ''depression'', confusion, sores or ulcers on the mouth, ulcers at the corners of the mouth, confusion, and irritability.''There are no documented health problems associated with consuming vitamin B6 from food sources. There have been problems associated with excess supplementation of vitamin B6. Large doses, above 1,000 mg/day, have been shown to cause sensory neuropathy. Symptoms of this include difficulty ''walking'' and ''pain'' and numbness of the extremities. There have even been some reported cases of this with doses under 500 mg/day. Even though this is a water-soluble vitamin, limits had to be set on how much can be safely consumed.''The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for vitamin B6 was set for the general population:' red blood cell metabolism, making hemoglobin, assisting in the proper functioning of the nervous system, assisting in the proper functioning of the immune system, protein metabolism, and synthesis of serotonin and norepinephrine."
Thiamin (vitamin B1),"'What is thiamin, and what does it do?''Thiamin is another one of the water-soluble B vitamins.

''Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome'' can also be caused by a severe thiamin deficiency. ''Brain damage'' can occur as a result of this.''Thiamin is safe enough that no tolerable upper limit (UL) has been established for it. There are no health benefits from extremely high supplementation, so there is no need to take excessive quantities.' metabolism of carbohydrates, nervous system functioning, producing hydrochloric acid, muscle functioning, flow of electrolytes in and out cells, and multiple enzyme processes. 20%-35% lost in water that is discarded after cooking vegetables, 43% loss in pork loin that is roasted (three times as much as lost during braising), 15% loss in bread that is baked, and no loss in double broiler cooking of whole grain cereals."
Niacin,"'Niacin'' is a water-soluble B vitamin that is also known as vitamin B3, nicotinamide, or nicotinic acid. Niacin assists in the proper functioning of the nervous and ''digestive system'', maintaining healthy skin, and conversion of food to energy.''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for niacin for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for niacin is:''Niacin is found in animal products, nuts, green vegetables, legumes, and enriched and fortified cereals.''Do I need to take a niacin supplement?''A well-balanced diet can provide enough niacin to reach your needs. When you have a medical need, a deficiency, or an inadequate diet, you should consult with your physician before taking a niacin supplement. High doses must be prescribed by a physician since niacin can be used as a drug (see below). Niacin supplements come in several forms: niacin, inositol hexaniacinate, and niacinamide''Niacin was discovered in low-income populations where ''corn'' products were the primary source of calories, and the disease pellagra was occurring. The symptoms of pellagra are known as the four Ds: ''dermatitis'', diarrhea, ''dementia'', and death. Pellagra occurs at the late stage of niacin deficiency. Niacin deficiency symptoms will involve the digestive system (diarrhea, ''vomiting'', and bright red tongue), the skin (thick, scaly skin and dark pigmented ''rash'' that develops symmetrically in areas exposed to sunlight), and the nervous system (''fatigue'', ''depression'', ''headache'', ''apathy'', disorientation, and ''memory loss''). ''Doses much higher than the ULs are used medically to improve ''cholesterol levels''. High doses of niacin can cause dangerous liver inflammation, peptic ulcers, and skin ''rashes''. ""Niacin flushing"" is a side effect that causes redness, ''itching'', and burning and can occur within 10 to 15 minutes after taking it and can last up to one hour. Research has shown that there are conditions that make people susceptible to these symptoms, including ''diabetes mellitus'', ''gout'', cardiac arrhythmias, hepatic dysfunction or a history of ''liver disease'', ''migraine'' ''headaches'', ''alcoholism'', and ''inflammatory bowel disease''. These conditions may not be protected by the UL that has been set for the general population, so extreme caution needs to be used when taking niacin supplements. For everyone, the only time that high doses of niacin should be taken would be under the supervision of your physician. ''The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for niacin is:' "
Riboflavin,"'Riboflavin is one of the water-soluble B vitamins and is also known as vitamin B2. It is needed for converting food to energy, works as an antioxidant by scavenging damaging free radicals, and is needed to convert vitamin B6 and folate into active forms.''There is insufficient information to establish an RDA for vitamin riboflavin for infants. In this case, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established:''The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for riboflavin is:''Though riboflavin can be found in most animal and plant foods, it is destroyed by light, so these foods need to be stored away from light to protect it. It can be lost in the water if foods are boiled or soaked, so avoid doing this or consume the water along with the food (for example, soup). ''A well-balanced diet can provide enough riboflavin to reach your RDA. When your diet is limited in variety or you have a medical condition that interferes with the absorption of riboflavin, you may need a supplement. The most common forms of riboflavin found in supplements are riboflavin 5-monophosphate and riboflavin. These can be purchased alone, in a multivitamin, or in a B complex supplement.''Riboflavin deficiency can occur from not consuming enough in your diet and from conditions that decrease the amount absorbed, including malabsorption syndromes, chronic diarrhea, long-term use of barbiturates, peritoneal ''dialysis'', and alcoholism. Ariboflavinosis is caused by riboflavin deficiency. The symptoms include fatigue, cracks and sores around the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis/cheilosis), eye fatigue, swollen magenta tongue (glossitis), skin irritation (dermatitis), soreness and swelling of the throat, ''sensitivity to light'', and eye fatigue.''No Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) has been set for riboflavin. Possible reactions to very high doses include burning/prickling sensations, ''itching'"", numbness, and yellow discoloration of the urine. There is also a possibility that riboflavin's photosensitizing (sensitivity to light) properties can pose health risks. "" "
Vitamin K,"'Vitamin K'' is a fat-soluble vitamin known for its role in blood clotting. There are three main types of vitamin K: vitamin K1 (phytonadione) if the natural form found in plants; vitamin K2 (menaquinones) is made by the human gut; and vitamin K3 (menadione) is the water-soluble form that is made for use in supplements.'"" People taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin) are at an increased risk for blood clotting. Warfarin works by decreasing the activity of vitamin K, lengthening the time it takes for a clot to form. The goal for vitamin K intake while taking warfarin is to keep your intake constant. This does not mean that you can't consume any vitamin K-containing foods. Instead, you want to consume a consistent amount so that the dose of warfarin that you are taking is working on the same amount. Sudden increases and/or decreases in vitamin K while taking warfarin can cause problems.""'There is no data to establish RDAs for vitamin K. Therefore, Adequate Intakes (AI) have been established:''Vitamin K is found primarily in green leafy vegetables and fruit. It can also be found in some animal foods.''A well-balanced diet can provide an adequate amount of vitamin K. There are conditions that can interfere with the absorption of vitamin K, including ''celiac disease'', ''ulcerative colitis'', cystic fibrosis, biliary obstruction, regional ''enteritis'', or intestinal resection. Medications that alter your ''liver function'' or kill the intestinal flora can also negatively impact your vitamin K levels. These medications include antibiotics, antiseizure medications, salicylates, and some sulfa ''drugs''. ''Vitamin K is needed by the liver to make factors that are necessary for blood to clot properly. A deficiency in vitamin K can lead to defective blood clotting and increased bleeding. ''The Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for vitamin K has not been established. Amounts exceeding 1,000 times the AI can promote formation of ''blood clots'' (thrombogenesis), breakdown of red blood cells (''hemolysis''), and raise the risk of ''jaundice''.' "
"Homocysteine, folic acid, and B vitamins","'Homocysteine'' is an amino acid that plays a role in ''coronary artery disease''. It is metabolized (chemically transformed) into methionine and cysteine with the help of the B ''vitamins''; ''folic acid'' (B9), B12, and B6 (''pyridoxine''). Therefore, insufficient amounts of these B ''vitamins'' in the body can theoretically hamper the metabolic breakdown of homocysteine, and hence increase its blood levels. High levels of homocysteine in the blood (''hyperhomocysteinemia'') can damage the inner surface of blood vessels, promote blood clotting, and accelerate ''atherosclerosis''.''The current state of knowledge regarding folic acid, homocysteine, and ''heart attacks'' is as follows:''Even though current scientific evidence suggests that taking folic acid and vitamin B ''supplements'' to lower homocysteine levels should help prevent atherosclerosis and ''heart attacks'', conclusive proof is still lacking because:''There is also no official recommendation as to who should be tested for hyperhomocysteinemia. The optimal doses of the B vitamins, folic acid, B12, and B6, required to prevent and treat hyperhomocysteinemia are also uncertain. For folic acid, a daily dose of 0.8-1.0 mg is probably adequate.'  The level of blood folate is an important determinant of the blood homocysteine level. Low blood folate levels are associated with high blood levels of homocysteine.  Low blood folate is common among individuals who do not take multivitamins, but unusual among those who do.  The consumption of folic acid supplements or folic acid fortified cereals can increase blood folate levels and decrease blood homocysteine levels. In a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of multivitamins) had fewer heart attacks than those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. There are no conclusive controlled studies demonstrating that increasing folic acid intake actually prevents atherosclerosis and heart attacks.  There is no clinical study demonstrating that lowering blood levels of homocysteine actually prevents atherosclerosis and heart attacks."
What about antioxidants for heart attack prevention?,"'Antioxidants are food supplements that have been promoted as preventing ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. An important early event in the development of a cholesterol plaque in atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of ''LDL cholesterol'' (low density lipoprotein) particles in the blood and the subsequent interaction of this modified LDL with the wall of the coronary artery. This process initiates the formation of the cholesterol plaque.''Antioxidants that block the oxidative modification of LDL have been shown to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in animal experiments. Examples of antioxidants include ''vitamin E'' and beta carotene. In humans, observational studies (studies that observe the frequency of related conditions) have found a relationship between the dietary intake of vitamin E and lower rates of heart attacks.''Observational studies provide only circumstantial evidence, however, and credible evidence is obtained only by way of controlled trials (discussed at the beginning of this article). Several controlled trials performed to date have yielded conflicting results on the benefits of antioxidant therapy. These results may possibly be due to the low doses of vitamin E used, the small number of patients in the study, or the limited duration of treatment.''The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study used a high dose (400 IU per day) of vitamin E over a span of five years in patients with significant risk factors for ''heart disease'' or ''stroke''. This study found no difference in the occurrence of heart attack or ''stroke'' in the group treated with vitamin E versus those given the placebo. This study demonstrated that antioxidant therapy does not have any benefit in persons who have or are at high risk for having atherosclerosis.' "
How about exercise for heart attack prevention?,"'Studies of the effects of ''exercise'' in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. This is likely due to the fact that people who ''exercise'' regularly generally have healthier lifestyles and that many risk factors for ''heart disease'' can be influenced by exercise. Therefore, the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate. For example, regular exercise has direct effects on ''weight control'', ''blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', blood cholesterol, and ''smoking''.'

What about smoking cessation for heart attack prevention?,"'Smoking cessation'', by whatever means, has been clearly demonstrated to reduce future heart attacks and death in patients with known ''coronary artery disease'' or who have other risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease. While many methods, both chemical and behavioral, have been used to aid ''smoking'' cessation, the initial success rate is often low, and the relapse rate is high. Certain medications that affect neurotransmitters in the brain, which are similar to agents often used to treat ''depression'' [for example, ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'', Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, ''Zyban'')], have recently been demonstrated to be helpful in many patients trying to stop ''smoking''. While effective, these agents may produce significant side effects and should only be used under the close supervision of a doctor. ' "
Recommendations to prevent heart attacks," Eat whole, natural, and fresh foods. Eat five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables daily and eat more peas, beans, and nuts.  Increase intake of omega-3 fatty acids by eating more fish, walnuts, flaxseed oil, and green leafy vegetables. An example of meeting the recommended intake of omega-3 fats is to eat 2 salmon portions a week or 1 gram of omega-3-fatty acid supplement daily. Drink water, tea, non-fat dairy and red wine (two drinks or less daily for men, one drink or less daily for women). Eat lean protein such as skinless poultry, fish, and lean cuts of red meat.  Avoid trans-fats and limit intake of saturated fats. This means avoiding fried foods, hard margarine, commercial baked goods, and most packaged and processed snack foods, high fat dairy and processed meats such as bacon, sausage, and deli meats. Limit glycemic foods. Glycemic foods are those made with sugar and white flour, which increase blood sugar levels. Increased blood sugar levels stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Chronically high insulin levels are believed to cause weight gain as well as atherosclerosis of the arteries. Exercise daily. Understand your risk factors and research in this area. For example, the Framingham Heart Study recruited residents of Framingham, Massachusetts beginning around 1948 and followed the group in an attempt to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to heart attack or stroke."
What is vitiligo?,'Vitiligo (vit-ill-EYE-go) is a disorder in which white patches of skin appear on different parts of the body. This happens because the cells that make pigment (color) in the skin are destroyed. These cells are called melanocytes (ma-LAN-o-sites). Vitiligo can also affect the mucous membranes (such as the tissue inside the mouth and nose) and the eye.'  
What causes vitiligo?,"'The cause is not known. Vitiligo may be an autoimmune disease. These diseases happen when your immune system mistakenly attacks some part of your own body. In vitiligo, the immune system may destroy the melanocytes in the skin. It is also possible that one or more genes may make a person more likely to get the disorder.''Some researchers think that the melanocytes destroy themselves. Others think that a single event such as ''sunburn'' or emotional distress can cause vitiligo. But these events have not been proven to cause vitiligo.' "
Who is affected by vitiligo?," Many people develop it in their twenties, but it can occur at any age. The disorder affects all races and both sexes equally, however, it is more noticeable in people with dark skin. People with certain autoimmune diseases (such as hyperthyroidism) are more likely to get vitiligo than people who don't have any autoimmune diseases. Scientists do not know why vitiligo is connected with these diseases. However, most people with vitiligo have no other autoimmune disease. Vitiligo may also run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it."
What are the symptoms vitiligo?,"'White patches on the skin are the main sign of vitiligo. These patches are more common in areas where the skin is exposed to the sun. The patches may be on the hands, ''feet'', arms, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches are:''People with vitiligo often have hair that turns gray early. Those with dark skin may notice a loss of color inside their mouths.' The armpits and groin (where the leg meets the body) Around the mouth Eyes Nostrils Navel Genitals Rectal areas."
Will the white patches spread?,"'There is no way to tell if vitiligo will spread. For some people, the white patches do not spread. But often the white patches will spread to other areas of the body. For some people, vitiligo spreads slowly, over many years. For other people, spreading occurs quickly. Some people have reported more white patches after physical or emotional ''stress''.'  "
How is vitiligo diagnosed?,"'The doctor will use a family and medical history, physical exam, and tests to diagnose vitiligo. The doctor may ask questions such as:''The doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems.''Tests might include:'   Do you have family members with vitiligo? Do you or family members have any autoimmune diseases? Did you have a rash, sunburn, or other skin problem before the white patches appeared? Did you have some type of stress or physical illness? Did your hair turn gray before age 35? Are you sensitive to the sun? Taking a small sample (biopsy) of the affected skin to be examined Blood tests An eye exam."
How is vitiligo treated?,"'Treatment may help make the skin look more even. The choice of treatment depends on:'""Some treatments are not right for everyone. Many treatments can have unwanted side effects. Treatments can take a long time, and sometimes they don't work.""'Current treatment options for vitiligo include medical, surgical, and other treatments. Most treatments are aimed at restoring color to the white patches of skin.''Medical treatments include'':''Surgical treatments include'':''Other treatments include'':'   The number of white patches How widespread the patches are The treatment the person prefers to use. Medicines (such as creams) that you put on the skin Medicines that you take by mouth A treatment that uses medicine plus ultraviolet A (UVA) light (PUVA) Removing the color from other areas so they match the white patches. Skin grafts from a person's own tissues. The doctor takes skin from one area of a patient's body and attaches it to another area. This is sometimes used for people with small patches of vitiligo. Tattooing small areas of skin. Sunscreens Cosmetics, such as makeup or dye, to cover the white patches Counseling and support."
What can people do to cope with vitiligo?,"'When you have vitiligo, you may be upset or ''depressed'' about the change in your appearance. There are several things you can do to cope with the disorder:''Some people with vitiligo have found that cosmetics that cover the white patches improve their appearance and help them feel better about themselves. A person may need to try several brands of concealing cosmetics before finding the product that works best.'   Find a doctor who knows how to treat vitiligo. The doctor should also be a good listener and be able to provide emotional support. Learn about the disorder and treatment choices. This can help you make decisions about your treatment. Talk with other people who have vitiligo. A vitiligo group can help you find a support group (check your local listings). Family and friends are another source of support."
What research is being done on vitiligo?,"'Scientists have gained a better understanding of vitiligo in recent years, especially through gene research. Current research includes studies to investigate:' How trauma or stress to the skin can trigger vitiligo or the development of new white patches. New treatments and better understanding of vitiligo using a mouse model. Genes that may cause or contribute to having vitiligo. Analysis of genes already known to be linked to vitiligo."

What is nausea? What is vomiting?,"'Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of an underlying illness and due to a not a specific disease. Nausea is the sensation that the stomach wants to empty itself, while vomiting (emesis) or throwing up, is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach. The term ""dry heaves"" (retching) refers to an episode of vomiting where there is no food in the stomach to vomit, and only small amounts of clear secretions are vomited.''Vomiting is a violent act in which the stomach, the ''esophagus'', stomach, and small intestine forcibly expel contents of the stomach (and sometimes the small intestine) in a coordinated fashion.'  "
What causes nausea and vomiting?,"'There are many causes of nausea and vomiting, for example:'   Acute gastritis (direct irritation of the stomach lining) Central causes in which signals from the vomiting center in the brain cause nausea and vomiting Other illnesses not due to stomach problems, for example, brain tumors, pancreatitis, and appendicitis Medications, medical treatments, and illicit or illegal drugs, drug or alcohol overdose Mechanical obstruction of the bowel"
"Gastrointestinal (GI, digestive) causes of anusea and vomiting","'Acute gastritis or ''esophagitis'' often caused by something that irritates the lining of the stomach or throat, for example:' Infections: Infections are often the cause of stomach irritation, whether it is a common virus or another type of infection. There may be associated crampy upper abdominal pain that is associated with nausea and vomiting. Fever and chills may be present. Common viral infections include noroviruses and rotavirus. Infection by bacteria in the Helicobacter family (such as H. Pylori) can also be the infectious agent. Stomach flu: Stomach flu (gastroenteritis) is when vomiting and diarrhea occur together and is associated with a viral infection that is outside of the stomach. It should not be confused with the flu (influenza), a viral infection with symptoms include fever, chills, cough, and muscle pain. Food poisoning: Food poisoning may cause significant vomiting, and the most common cause is a toxin released by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Symptoms of food poisoning begin within a couple hours of eating contaminated or poorly prepared food. Other bacterial causes of food poisoning include Salmonella,  Campylobacter,  Shigella, E. coli, Listeria, or Clostridium botulinum (botulism). Other stomach irritants: alcohol, smoking, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen may irritate the stomach lining and cause nausea and vomiting. Peptic ulcer disease: Peptic ulcer disease can range from mild irritation of the stomach lining to the formation of a defect in the protective lining of the stomach called an ulcer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, reflux esophagitis): Nausea or vomiting is also associated with GERD (acid from the stomach is refluxed into the esophagus)."
During pregnancy (morning sickness) cuases of nausea and vomiting,"'Vomiting in pregnancy is caused by hormone level changes in the bloodstream. Most women have moderate symptoms of ''morning sickness'', especially during the\xa0''first trimester''. The symptoms of morning sickness during pregnancy usually resolve by the fourth month. Rarely, a woman may experience severe vomiting, dehydration, and ''weight loss'', which is referred to as\xa0''hyperemesis gravidarum''.' "
Neurological causes of nausea and vomiting," Headache: especially migraine because it commonly is associated with nausea and vomiting. Inner ear: Motion sickness, labyrinthitis, benign positional vertigo, or Meniere's disease Increased pressure in the head (intracranial pressure): Any illness or injury that increases the pressure within the skull can cause vomiting.Brain swelling due to trauma (includes bleeding within the brain)Infection (meningitis or encephalitis)Tumors (benign or malignant)Abnormal electrolyte concentrations in the bloodstream and associated water imbalanceConcussion, patients with head injuries do not have to have detectable bleeding in the brain or brain swelling to have symptoms of brain irritation, which can include a headache, nausea, vomiting, changes in vision, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. Brain swelling due to trauma (includes bleeding within the brain) Infection (meningitis or encephalitis) Tumors (benign or malignant) Abnormal electrolyte concentrations in the bloodstream and associated water imbalance Concussion, patients with head injuries do not have to have detectable bleeding in the brain or brain swelling to have symptoms of brain irritation, which can include a headache, nausea, vomiting, changes in vision, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. Smells, sounds, and trauma: Certain smells or sounds can cause nausea and vomiting that originates in the brain. Whether it is the pain of a broken bone or the emotional shock of observing an event, vasovagal events can cause significant symptoms. In a vasovagal episode, the vagus nerve (one of the nerves that helps control basic body functions like heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure) is overly stimulated and can cause the heart rate to slow and blood vessels to dilate. This decreases the flow of blood to the brain and can cause fainting (syncope). Heat-related illness: For example heat exhaustion, extreme sunburn, or dehydration"
"Diabetes, diseases, and eating disorders","'People with ''diabetes'' can also develop nausea and vomiting should their blood sugars become abnormally high or low (''hyperglycemia'' or ''hypoglycemia'') because the ''sugar'' and ''insulin'' balance is disturbed.' Diabetes: Persons with diabetes may develop nausea because of gastroparesis, a condition in which the stomach fails to empty properly and is likely due to the generalized neuropathy (failure of the nerves in the body to send proper signals to and from the brain or regeneration of nerves in the stomach) that is a complication of the disease. Diseases, illness, or conditions: Many illnesses associated with the intra-abdominal organs can produce the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. These include digestive organ disease such as:HepatitisGallbladder diseasePancreatitisCrohn's diseaseKidney diseases (for example, kidney stones, infection, kidney failure)Some forms of cancerAppendicitis Hepatitis Gallbladder disease Pancreatitis Crohn's disease Kidney diseases (for example, kidney stones, infection, kidney failure) Some forms of cancer Appendicitis Abdominal adhesions. Abdominal pain and distention, nausea and vomiting, and inability to pass flatus (gas) or have a bowel movement are symptoms of intestinal (bowel obstruction). Common causes of bowel obstruction include previous surgery with the formation of adhesions, hernias, abnormal twisting of the GI tract, tumors, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.. Vomiting as an atypical symptom of another disease: Some additional illnesses will cause nausea and vomiting, even though there is no direct involvement of the stomach or gastrointestinal tract.Heart attack victims may experience nausea and vomiting as an atypical symptom of angina, especially if the heart attack affects the inferior or lower part of the heart.Lung infections, for example, pneumonia and bronchitis, may also cause nausea and vomiting, especially if the area of lung involved is near the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest form the abdomen. Heart attack victims may experience nausea and vomiting as an atypical symptom of angina, especially if the heart attack affects the inferior or lower part of the heart. Lung infections, for example, pneumonia and bronchitis, may also cause nausea and vomiting, especially if the area of lung involved is near the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest form the abdomen. Sepsis: An overwhelming body infection spread through the bloodstream may also be associated with nausea and vomiting. Eating disorders: Patients with bulimia will have self-induced vomiting, purging as part of their psychiatric illness"
Nausea and vomitnig caused by drug side effects,"   Side effects from medications: The side effect of many medications include stomach irritation and/or nausea and vomiting. Anti-cancer drugs used for chemotherapy commonly cause nausea and vomiting that is not easily relieved. Narcotic pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, steroids, and antibiotics all have nausea and vomiting listed as common side effects. Radiation therapy: Nausea and vomiting can be associated with radiation therapy. Chemotherapy for cancer"
Vomiting in infants,"'It may be hard to decide if an infant is vomiting or spitting up. If the episodes occur shortly after feeding and only a small amount comes up, this may be spitting up.' Forceful vomiting: In the first two or three months, if the vomiting is forceful after eating (imagine it flying across the room), this may be a sign of pyloric stenosis, or an abnormal narrowing of the pylorus, the location where the stomach empties into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The vomiting is impressive and is described as a projectile. The diagnosis is often made by history and physical examination, confirmed by ultrasound. The treatment is surgery. Vomiting associated with pain: if the infant cries uncontrollably, and if the stool is bloody or red, the diagnosis may be an intussusception (the pushing of one segment of the bowel into an adjacent segment). The stool is classically described as currant jelly, but any blood in the stool is not normal and should always be a cause for concern. It is reasonable to seek medical care for an inconsolable infant. Viral infection: If there is vomiting with associated diarrhea that is not bloody, then a viral infection is a possibility. Alternatively, there may be an issue with intolerance to the type of baby formula. Infants and children are at greater risk of dehydration if the vomiting episodes last for more than 24 hours. If dehydration is suspected, seek medical care. Signs and symptoms of dehydration in an infant include dry mouth, lack of sweat in the armpits and groin, sunken eyes, weakness with a poor cry, and decreased muscle tone."
How is the cause of nausea and vomiting diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis often can be made when the health care professional takes a careful history and performs a physical examination. Any tests that need to be ordered will be based on the information from the history and physical exam, and sometimes no further testing is required to make the diagnosis.''Laboratory tests and ''X-rays'' may be ordered to assess the stability of the patient and not necessarily to make the diagnosis. For example, a patient with food poisoning may need blood tests ordered to measure the electrolytes(''minerals'') and other chemicals, since the patient may lose significant amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride from the body from persistent vomiting and ''diarrhea''.''Urinalysis'' may be helpful in assessing hydration status. Concentrated, ''dark urine'' is associated with dehydration because the kidneys try to preserve as much water as possible in the body. Ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.' "
What treatments and drugs help relieve nausea or vomiting?,"'Nausea and vomiting can be treated with medication at the same time as the search for the underlying diagnosis are being carried out. Ideally, these symptoms should resolve when the underlying illness is treated and controlled.''Nausea and vomiting are often made worse when you are dehydrated, resulting in a vicious cycle. Nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid, making the dehydration worse, which then increases nausea. Intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue and break the cycle.''There are varieties of ''anti-nausea'' medications (''antiemetics'') that your doctor may prescribe. These drugs can be administered in different ways depending upon your ability to take them. Medications are available by pill, liquid, or tablets that dissolve on or under the tongue, by intravenous or intramuscular injection, or by rectal suppository.''Common medications used to control nausea and vomiting include:'""The decision as to which medication to use will depend on the patient's condition."" promethazine (Phenergan), prochlorperazine (Compazine), droperidol (Inapsine) metoclopramide (Reglan), and ondansetron (Zofran)."
What natural home remedies help relieve nausea and vomiting?,"'It is important to rest the stomach and yet still avoid dehydration. Clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness, and then the ''diet'' should be advanced as tolerated.''Clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include:'""It is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach theoretically may cause nausea to worsen. One to two ounces of fluid at a time, taken every 10-15 minutes, may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate. In infants and children, the amount may be as little as 5 or 10 cc's or less than a third of an ounce at a time.""'Milk products should be avoided for the first 24-48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting. If the infection involves the small intestine, the enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the small intestine can become depleted. This can reduce the tolerance to milk and milk-containing products and lead to, ''bloating'', vomiting, and diarrhea. As the affected individual begins to feel better, they can begin to reintroduce foods, but to help the stomach readjust, health care professionals often recommend limiting the ''diet'' to bland foods such as bananas, applesauce, rice, toast (the BRAT diet).' Water Sports drinks Clear broths Popsicles Jell-O"
When should I call the doctor for nausea and vomiting?,"'If the symptoms last for more than 24 hours, if the diagnosis is uncertain, if there is concern about dehydration, or if the patient has underlying medical conditions that make them more fragile, medical care should be accessed sooner, rather than later.''Infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration and may not have as much reserve as an adult. If there is concern about dehydration or the inability to tolerate fluids, a health care professional should be contacted.''If nausea and vomiting are associated with pain, fever, ''vomiting blood'', or having bloody or black, tarry bowel movements, medical care should be sought immediately.''Vomiting is a symptom of an illness, if the symptom persists for more than 24-48 hours, it may be wise to contact a health care professional.' "
What is cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS)?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a disorder that causes recurrent episodes of ''nausea'', vomiting, and ''tiredness'' (lethargy) that are also termed as “paroxysmal and stereotypic”. This condition is diagnosed most often in young children, but it can affect people of any age. It was first described by Samuel Gee in 1882; the etiology and pathophysiology is unknown but researchers suggest genetic component may play a significant role in this syndrome. CVS is characterized by episodes of rapid vomiting followed with periods of completely normal health - clinicians suggest this off and on again stereotypic vomiting pattern that usually consists of four phases is the diagnostic feature of the syndrome.' "
4 Phases of cyclic vomiting syndrome,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome has four phases:' Symptom-free interval phase: This phase is the period between episodes when no symptoms are present. Prodromal phase: This phase signals that an episode of nausea and vomiting is about to begin. Often marked by nausea -- with or without abdominal pain -- this phase can last from just a few minutes to several hours. Sometimes, taking medicine early in this phase can stop an episode in progress. Sometimes there is no warning. A person may simply wake up in the morning and begin vomiting. Vomiting phase: This phase consists of nausea and vomiting; an inability to eat, drink, or take medicines without vomiting; paleness; drowsiness; and exhaustion. Recovery phase: This phase begins when the nausea and vomiting stop. Healthy color, appetite, and energy return."
Cyclic vomiting syndrome symptoms and signs,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by attacks of intense nausea, vomiting, and lethargy that last anywhere from an hour to 10 days. A person may vomit several times per hour, potentially leading to a dangerous loss of fluids (''dehydration''). Additional symptoms can include unusually ''pale skin'' (pallor or paleness), ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', ''headache'', and an increased sensitivity to light (''photophobia'') or to sound (phonophobia). In most affected people, the signs and symptoms of each attack are quite similar. Consequently, the person with cyclic vomiting syndrome may have one or more of these symptoms and signs:''Cyclic vomiting syndrome attacks can be debilitating, making it difficult for an affected person to go to work or school. Unfortunately, these symptoms and signs listed above can occur with many other diseases; the alternating pattern of symptoms and periods of remission is the major sign of cyclic vomiting syndrome. In addition, most individuals with cyclic vomiting syndrome exhibit the same pattern of symptoms during each cycle of severe nausea and vomiting.'   Repeated vomiting or retching Heaving or gagging (dry vomiting) Abdominal pain Diarrhea Fever Dizziness Pale skin Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) Headaches Loss of appetite Thirst Reduced or less urination Motion sickness Fatigue or exhaustion"
"Causes, triggers, and risk factors","'Episodes of nausea and vomiting can be caused and triggered by several different factors.''Migraine headache'':'' Researchers have suggested ''migraine''-related mechanisms may be involved. For example, patients with CVS have a family prevalence of ''migraine'' ''headaches'' and many patients with CVS that eventually resolved developed migraine ''headaches'' in adulthood.''Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA)'' also may play a role. Researchers have demonstrated that 86% of children with CVS and neuromuscular disease had mothers with a history of migraine. In children with CVS, mDNA showed high frequency of polymorphic changes in mDNA termed16519T and 3010A.''Sympathetic nerve hyper-responsiveness and autonomic dysfunctions:'' Patients with CVS appear to have sympathetic nerve hyper-responsiveness and autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms include flushing, paleness to the skin, ''fever'', lethargy, increased saliva production, and ''diarrhea'' are at higher risk for developing CVS.''Stress'' response:'' Psychological, physical, and infectious episodes are known triggers of this syndrome.''Chronic recreational ''marijuana'' use: ''Chronic ''marijuana'' use has been associated with CVS episodes and may be linked to nausea/vomiting through the endocannabinoid system, which is thought to play a role in nausea, vomiting, and ''stress'' control. Some researchers suggest that males younger than 19 years of age with CVS-like symptoms should always be asked about marijuana use.''The brain-gut connection or theory'' has been mentioned as a cause of CVS, especially in the early literature. Although the theory has some support (for example, ''stress'' and/or ''migraines'' triggers vomiting) other factors (physiological or genetic) may equally trigger the disease. Some others suggest the gut bacteria may trigger CVS if bacterial overgrowth of the normal bacterial flora in the gut occurs but good evidence for this theory is lacking.''Consequently, it is not clear which factors comprise the highest risk factors for CVS. However, most researchers consider the problem to either be caused by, or to have increased risk for CVS when several factors converge (genetic, autonomic, environmental and/or nerve/brain functions) thus resulting in multifactorial causes and risk factors for it. Currently, most researchers conclude the cause(s) are unknown.'   The most common causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome are infections (chronic sinusitis, tooth decay, for example) and emotional excitement (panic attacks, anxiety, holidays, parties) with positive situations outnumbering negative. Other triggers can include periods without eating (fasting), temperature extremes of hot or cold, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods (chocolate, cheese, monosodium glutamate), overeating, alcohol consumption, and menstruation."
Who gets cyclic vomiting syndrome?,"'The exact prevalence of cyclic vomiting syndrome is unknown; estimates range from 3.15 to 2,000 per 100,000 children. The condition is diagnosed less commonly in adults, although recent studies suggest that the condition could be as common in adults as in children.' "
Is it genetic (inherited)?,"'In most cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome, affected people have no known history of the disorder in their family, but many CVS-affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as ''migraines'', in their mothers and other maternal relatives. This family history suggests an inheritance pattern known as maternal inheritance or mitochondrial inheritance, which applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Disorders with mitochondrial inheritance can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females. However, because mitochondria can be passed from one generation to the next only through egg cells (not through sperm cells), only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. In addition, most researchers suggest that CVS development may require other factors to help trigger genetic component.' "
Which specialties of doctors or other health care professionals treat the condition?,"""In addition to the patient's primary-care physician or pediatrician, gastroenterologists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the ""'digestive system'') are usually consulted. In addition, critical-care specialists (adult or pediatric) may need to be consulted if complications develop.' "
How do I know if I have CVS (diagnosis)?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is hard to diagnose because no tests -- such as a blood test or X-ray -- can establish a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome. A doctor must look at symptoms and medical history to rule out other common diseases or disorders that can cause nausea and vomiting. Making a diagnosis takes time because the doctor also needs to identify a pattern or cycle to the vomiting. For example, the patient who has had at least five separate episodes of vomiting or at least three separate episodes over six months for children or one year for adults, that have had attacks similar to previous episodes (for example, they started the same time of day, last same time span and have the same intensity), makes the diagnosis of CVS more likely.''However, it is not unusual to have laboratory tests such as CT, ''ultrasound'' or ''MRI'' of the abdomen, magnetic resonance enterography, ''endoscopy'', ''upper GI series'' of ''X-rays'', gastrointestinal motility tests, ''food allergy'' tests, and others performed to help the physician be sure that diseases with similar symptoms are not causing the problems.' "
Is there a diet or natrual treatments for this syndrome? ,"'Although home remedies have not been well studied, anecdotal reports suggest at least three remedies may help some patients. They are biofeedback to reduce ''stress'', L-carnitine that helps turn fat into energy, and ''coenzyme Q10'', a substance that aids mitochondrial dysfunction.''Reports of diets that help reduce the frequency of reoccurrence of CVS attacks include ''gluten''-free diets, a Paleo ''diet'' (''diet'' based on foods eaten by early humans such as fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit without dairy or green products), and GAPS ''diet'' (complicated ''diet'"" plan designed for individuals with gastrointestinal immune problems). Parents and individuals should check with their physician before utilizing any of these home remedies or diets to avoid any potential side effects or deterioration in the child's or adult's condition."" "
How is cyclic vomiting syndrome  treated?,"'Treatment varies, but people with cyclic vomiting syndrome generally improve after learning to control their symptoms. People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are advised to get plenty of rest and ''sleep'' and to take medications that prevent a vomiting episode, stop one in progress, speed up recovery, or relieve associated symptoms.''Treatment of vomiting phase:'' Once a vomiting episode begins, treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and ''sleep'' in a dark, quiet room. Severe nausea and vomiting may require hospitalization and intravenous fluids to prevent ''dehydration''. ''Sedatives'' may help if the nausea continues.''Treatment during prodromal phase:'' Sometimes, during the prodromal phase, it is possible to stop an episode from happening. People with nausea or ''abdominal pain'' before an episode can ask their doctor about taking ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') or ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') for nausea or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') for ''pain''. Other medications that may be helpful are ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') or ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), which help calm the stomach by lowering the amount of acid it makes.''Treatment during recovery phase:'"" During this phase it's very important to drink water and replace lost ""'electrolytes''. ''Electrolytes'' are salts the body needs to function and stay healthy. Symptoms during the recovery phase can vary. Some people find their appetite returns to normal immediately, while others need to begin by drinking clear liquids and then move slowly to solid food.''Frequent and long-lasting episode treatment:'' People whose episodes are frequent and long-lasting may be treated during the symptom-free intervals in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes. Medications that help people with migraine ''headaches'', such as ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''), and ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''), are sometimes used during this phase, but they do not work for everyone. Taking the medicine daily for one to two months may be necessary before one can tell if it helps.''Symptom-free phase:'' The symptom-free interval phase is a good time to eliminate anything known to trigger an episode. For example, if episodes are brought on by stress or excitement, a symptom-free interval phase is the time to find ways to reduce stress and stay calm. Behavioral therapy may help reduce attacks by reducing stress and ''anxiety''.''Sinus and ''allergy'' causes:'' If sinus problems or ''allergies'' cause episodes, those conditions should be treated early to reduce the chance for a CVS attack.''Migraine treatment:'' During an episode, anti-migraine ''drugs'' such as ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'') may be prescribed to stop ''symptoms of migraine'' ''headache''. The safety and efficacy of these medications has not been established in children under 18 years of age.'  "
What are the complications if the condition isn't treated?,"'If the condition is not treated, attacks typically occur four to 12 times per year. Between episodes, vomiting is absent, and nausea is either absent or much reduced. Many affected people experience other symptoms during and between episodes, including ''pain'', digestive disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') and ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), and ''fainting'' spells (''syncope''). In addition, complications of CVS can also include ''dehydration'', ''electrolyte'' abnormalities, damage to the ''esophagus'', and ''tooth decay'' due to the acid in vomit. People with cyclic vomiting syndrome are also more likely than people without the disorder to experience ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''panic disorder''. It is unclear how these health conditions are related to nausea and vomiting.' "
What is the relationship between cyclic vomiting syndrome and migraines?,"'Cyclic vomiting syndrome is generally considered to be a variant of ''migraines'', which are severe ''headaches'' often associated with pain, nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Many people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have a family history of migraines, and attacks of nausea and vomiting may be replaced by migraine ''headaches'' as an affected person gets older.' "
"What other problems accompany this condition, and what is the prognosis?","'Most people with cyclic vomiting syndrome have normal intelligence, although some affected people have experienced developmental delay or intellectual disability, muscle ''weakness'' (myopathy), and/or ''seizures''. People with these additional features are said to have cyclic vomiting syndrome plus.''The prognosis for CVS varies. Patients with complications and weak responses to treatment have a fair prognosis while others may respond well and have a good prognosis. In general, CVS lasts about two and a half to five and a half years, resolving late childhood or early adolescence. Some patients go on to develop migraine ''headaches'', and a few patients have CVS extend into adulthood. Patients with a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome plus have a prognosis usually ranging from fair to poor.' "
Is it possible to prevent this syndrome?,"'Most investigators who study CVS suggest there are ways to prevent or reduce the number of CVS attacks. Ways to prevent and/or reduce attacks include the following:' Get adequate sleep. Seek help to prevent stress and anxiety. Treat infections and/or allergies early. Avoid any triggers of CVS, especially related to foods. During the well phase, eat a balanced diet with regular meals. Utilize appropriate medications prescribed by a physician to reduce CVS symptoms."
What are the genetic changes related to this syndrome?,"'Although the exact causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome have yet to be determined, researchers have proposed several factors that may contribute to the disorder. These factors include changes in brain function, hormonal abnormalities, and gastrointestinal problems. Many researchers believe that cyclic vomiting syndrome is a migraine-like condition, which suggests that it is related to changes in signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in certain areas of the brain.''Some cases of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be related to genetic changes in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA, mDNA, or mtDNA).''Several changes in mitochondrial DNA have been associated with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Some of these changes alter single DNA building blocks (nucleotides), whereas others rearrange larger segments of mitochondrial DNA. These changes likely impair the ability of mitochondria to produce energy. Defects in energy production may lead to symptoms during periods when the body requires more energy, such as when the immune system is fighting an infection. It remains unclear how changes in mitochondrial function are related to recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.' "
What other names do people use for cyclic vomiting syndrome?, CVS Cyclical vomiting Cyclical vomiting syndrome Periodic vomiting
What are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)?,"'Enterococci are a group of gram-positive, round-shaped bacteria that commonly live in the gut, although they can cause infection anywhere in the body. They are resistant to several antibiotics, but in the past, physicians could rely on the drug vancomycin to effectively treat enterococcal infections. In recent decades, however, some enterococci have become resistant to vancomycin. The two main species that cause problems are vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus faecium'' and vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus faecalis''. ''E. faecium'' is the most common species of VRE. These bacteria are not the same genus as other common fecal bacteria such as ''E. coli''.''Vancomycin resistance is acquired when a sensitive ''Enterococcus'' acquires a special piece of DNA called a plasmid that permits the bacteria to become resistant to vancomycin. The new ''strains'' are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). One concern is that VRE strains appear able to transfer vancomycin resistance to unrelated bacteria such as ''MRSA'' (''methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus'') and these strains are renamed VRSA. In addition, VRE organisms, like ''MRSA'', are usually resistant to more than one antibiotic.''VRE can be spread from person to person and are an increasing problem in hospitals and chronic care facilities. Approximately 30% of all enterococcal infections are now caused by vancomycin-resistant strains (VRE).' "
What causes a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE can exist in the body without causing infection, in which case a patient is said to be colonized with VRE. Colonization usually occurs in the bowel. If the number of VRE bacteria increases, they can invade the bloodstream or spread locally to cause an abdominal ''abscess'' or ''urinary tract infection''. Once in the bloodstream, VRE can cause meningitis, ''pneumonia'', or infection of a heart valve (endocarditis). VRE may also be introduced directly into an open sore or wound, causing a wound infection. The bacteria produce several substances, including proteases that help them break down the normal barriers between the gut tissue and the bloodstream. The vancomycin resistance in the bacteria are caused by a plasmid, a fragment of genetic material that allows the bacteria to be resistant to vancomycin.'  "
Are VRE contagious?,"'VRE are ''contagious'' from person to person. However, if a patient takes antibiotics, VRE organisms may develop in the individual (usually in the gastrointestinal tract or on other mucous membranes) and then invade the bloodstream or other areas. These individuals can then be contagious to other people.' "
How are vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) spread?,"'VRE can be transmitted from person to person, especially in a hospital or chronic care facility. Microscopic amounts of fecal material from an infected or colonized patient can contaminate the hospital environment and be spread on the hands of health care personnel or by contamination of surfaces such as bedding or clothing. Patients who have VRE may inadvertently contaminate their beds and bathrooms. If the environment is not adequately cleaned, the next patient (or visitor) in the room may be at risk. VRE infections are not spread by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''.' "
What are risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections?,"'The healthy bowel harbors more than 400 different species of bacteria which compete with each other and help keep any one organism from overgrowing. However, if a patient takes antibiotics, some bacterial species are killed off and the balance among the bacteria is disrupted. In this case, a single species like VRE may increase to the point at which it can invade the bloodstream or cause a local infection. Thus, prior use of antibiotics, especially vancomycin, is a risk factor for infection with VRE. Other risk factors include having a compromised immune system, ''cancer'', a chronic disease like ''diabetes'', or ''kidney failure''. Infection is also more likely if there is a small break in the mucosal membrane (lining) of the bowel or in patients undergoing a gastrointestinal surgery or procedure. Indwelling devices, such as urinary catheters or intravenous lines, increase the risk of infection because they disrupt the normal mucosal or skin barriers and provide a type of artificial reef on which the organisms can grow. If a person is colonized or is hospitalized, their risk for infection with VRE increases.' "
What is the incubation period and contagious period for VRE?,"'The incubation period for VRE is not well documented, especially in those patients who develop VRE from taking antibiotics and because some individuals may be carriers of VRE and become infected after some problem that decreases their immune responses or damages their ''mucus'' membranes. Estimates of the incubation period vary from days to weeks or even longer, and the contagious period is estimated to be as long as VRE are shed from the patient.' "
"What are the signs and symptoms of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) 
infection?","'The symptoms of VRE infection vary according to the site of infection. If VRE has invaded the bloodstream, the patient will have ''fever'', a fast heart rate, and feel very sick. This syndrome is called ''sepsis''. In severe cases, the ''blood pressure'' may fall, causing ''shock'', although this is less common with VRE than with some other bacteria. Patients with urinary infections (''UTI'') may experience burning or ''pain'' with urination, ''back pain'', ''difficulty urinating'', ''frequent urination'', or ''fever''. Meningitis is uncommon and causes ''headache'', ''stiff neck'', ''confusion'', and/or fever. Infection of a heart valve (endocarditis) causes prolonged sepsis and may cause the valve to leak or fail. Endocarditis is more common if the patient already has a damaged heart valve or an artificial valve. Infected wounds are inflamed, with red and warm skin, soreness, swelling, and contain pus or have ''pus drainage''. ''Pneumonia'' causes fever, difficulty ''breathing'', and ''cough''.'  "
What types of doctors treat VRE infections?,"'Although some VRE infections may be treated by pediatricians and/or primary care physicians, more serious infections may be diagnosed and treated in consultation with emergency-medicine specialists, infectious-disease specialists, internal-medicine specialists, critical care specialists, and in some cases, surgeons. Ancillary personnel who may help manage VRE-infected patients may include hospital infection-control workers and pharmacists.' "
How do physicians diagnose vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections?,"'Diagnosis requires culturing the organism. VRE is easily grown on culture plates in a laboratory. Definitive diagnosis requires that the organisms show resistance to vancomycin; usually sensitivities to additional antibiotics are determined at the same time. To get material to culture, a sample of the infected tissue is taken. For a wound infection, a swab is usually rubbed over the surface to get infected material. Blood is drawn and cultured to detect sepsis or endocarditis. Urine or sputum samples are taken to identify ''urinary tract infections'' or pneumonia. If VRE is cultured from blood or spinal fluid, it almost invariably indicates infection. However, if VRE is cultured from sputum, urine, or a wound, it could indicate either colonization or infection. The physician will ask the patient questions and perform a physical exam to help determine if any signs or symptoms of infection of these areas are present. Imaging studies such as ''X-rays'' or ''CT scans'' may be used to detect pneumonia or abscesses.' "
What is the treatment for a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE are resistant to a wide array of antibiotics. Fortunately, newer antibiotics have been developed to ''bridge'' this gap, but sometimes they must be used in combination with other antibiotics. Most microbiological laboratories will supply the physician treating the patient with a list of antibiotics the VRE are resistant and susceptible to. If the laboratory does not or cannot provide an alternative antibiotic for VRE treatment, the state lab or the CDC should be notified as they may be able to provide additional help and suggestions for treatment.''Linezolid'', daptomycin, ''tigecycline'', oritavancin, telavancin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and teicoplanin (not available in the U.S.) are antimicrobials that have been used with success against various VRE strains. Clinicians have also had some success in treating VRE with various combinations of antibiotics. However, VRE antibiotic susceptibility tests done for each infection should help guide the selection of treatment protocols. In addition, consultation with an infectious-disease expert is usually done.''Other procedures can augment the antimicrobial treatment of VRE-infected patients. If there is a collection of pus, such as an abscess, it is important that it be drained. If the infection is associated with an intravenous line, the line should be removed if at all possible. Similarly, it is desirable to remove urinary catheters to facilitate treatment of the ''urinary tract infection''. Patients who are colonized but not infected do not require treatment. There is no established way to eradicate colonization of the ''stool'' once it occurs.''People infected with VRE need to be treated by medical caregivers; there is no home remedy for VRE infections.'  "
What is the prognosis of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'VRE infections can be cured in most patients, and the outcome is often more dependent on the underlying disease than on the infecting organism. The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection. For example, heart-valve infections may require six weeks of antibiotic therapy. Although the heart valve or other infected site infection is cured of VRE infection, many patients may be still colonized with the organism on mucosal surfaces.' "
What are the complications of VRE infections?,"'The complications most often seen with VRE infections are sepsis, endocarditis, ''urinary tract infections'', meningitis, and severe wound infections. Early appropriate antibiotic treatment can reduce the severity of these complications; if any complications develop, an infectious-disease consultant is recommended.' "
Is it possible to prevent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections?,"'The best way to prevent infection is to prevent transmission. This means that hospitals and care facilities must pay meticulous attention to infection-control guidelines to reduce the spread of VRE from patient to patient. Individuals can reduce their risk by washing hands after using the bathroom and before and after touching the mouth or nose. Minimizing the use of intravenous catheters, especially central lines, reduces the risk of VRE sepsis. Similarly, the use of urinary catheters should be minimized and catheters should be removed promptly when no longer needed. Finally, antibiotics should be used only for appropriate indications. Antibiotics are ineffective against ''viruses'' and the ''common cold''. There is no ''vaccine'' available against VRE.' "
What precautions should people take when tending to someone with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection?,"'Caretakers of infected patients should follow good hand hygiene principles. This means washing hands or using ''alcohol'"" disinfectants on hands before and after touching the patient or objects in the patient's environment. If there is visible soiling of the hands, soap and water should be used rather than alcohol-based disinfectants. If the patient is ""'incontinent'' of ''stool'' or urine, gloves should be used to clean the bed or the patient. However, gloves are not a substitute for good hand hygiene. Simple household disinfectants are effective against VRE and can be used to clean the environment. A 10% bleach solution may also be used.''Hospitals will take additional precautions. Once a patient is known to harbor VRE, whether colonized or infected, the patient will be placed in ""contact precautions,"" usually in a private room. People entering the room will wear a cloth or paper gown over their clothes and use gloves. Again, hand hygiene is critical to reduce spread of the organism. Masks are not needed because VRE is not spread through the air but by direct contact.'  "
What research is being done on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)?,"'Research on VRE is focused on several areas:' Improving infection-control practices to reduce spread of VRE in health care environments The development of new antibiotics to treat VRE (for example, dalbavancin [Dalvance], tedizolid [Sivextro]) The development of urinary catheters and intravenous catheters that are more resistant to infection Basic research aimed at improving our understanding of the bacteria itself and how vancomycin resistance is transferred from species to species"

What is a ventricular septal defect (VSD)?,"'A ''ventricular septal defect'' (VSD) is a heart malformation present at birth. Any condition that is present at birth can also be termed a ""congenital"" condition. A VSD, therefore, is a type of congenital ''heart disease'' (CHD). The heart with a VSD has a hole in the wall (the septum) between its two lower chambers (the ventricles).' "
How common is a VSD?,"'The most frequent types of ''congenital malformations'' affect the heart. It is estimated that approximately eight in 1,000 newborns have CHD. A VSD is the most frequent of the various types of CHD (25%-30% of all CHD). Approximately one infant in 500 will be born with a VSD.' "
What is the normal design of the heart?,"'The heart is made up of four separate chambers. The upper right chamber (''atrium'') receives blood back from the body with much of the oxygen extracted by the body organs and tissues. The blood is then pumped through a one-way valve into the lower right chamber (ventricle) from which it is pumped to the lungs to be again enriched with oxygen. This highly oxygenated blood then returns to the upper left-sided chamber (''atrium'') and next passes through a one-way valve into the lower left chamber (ventricle). From there, the oxygenated blood is pumped out into a large blood vessel (the ''aorta'') and is distributed throughout the body through arteries.''The two upper chambers (right and left atria) are separated by a wall of muscle called the septum. Similarly, the two lower chambers (right and left ventricles) are also separated by a separate muscular septum. These septa (plural of septum) keep the lower oxygenated blood that has returned from the body from mixing with the highly oxygenated blood which has returned from the lungs.''A VSD is a hole in the ventricular septum.' "
How do VSDs cause problems?,"'The pressure generated during contraction by the left ventricle (LV) is higher than that generated by the simultaneous contraction of the right ventricle (RV). Blood will thus be pushed through the VSD (also called ""shunted"") from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. The right ventricle has to do extra work to handle the additional blood volume. It may have trouble expelling this larger volume of blood and compromise the ability to pump efficiently. In addition, the lungs receive too much blood under too much pressure. The arterioles (small arteries) in the lungs thicken in response to the excess blood under excess pressure. If this extra pressure persists, permanent damage can be done to the lungs.''It makes a considerable difference whether the size of the VSD is small or large.  A larger VSD will allow more blood to be shunted from the higher-pressure LV to the lower pressure RV.  As noted above, this will promote enlargement of the RV.  It also promotes mixing of the highly oxygenated LV blood with the less oxygenated RV.  This lower oxygenated blood is circulated throughout the body.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a VSD?,"'An infant with a VSD will generally not start to demonstrate abnormalities until 2 or 3 days of life.  Common observations may include: (1) poor feeding (tires easily, poor suck); (2) rapid heart rate and respiratory rate; (3) unusual fussiness; and (4) pallor (paleness of the skin) and ''cyanosis'' (blue tinge of the skin).  Should the presence of a VSD be missed, infants may demonstrate: (1) poor ''weight gain'', (2) enlargement of the ''liver'' in association with ''congestive heart failure'' (inability to effectively pump blood); (3) ''shock'' and (4) possibly death.' "
How do doctors diagnose a VSD?,"'The diagnosis of a VSD is usually suspected clinically by ''hearing'' a characteristic ''heart murmur''. A murmur is a sound generated by abnormally turbulent flow of blood through the heart. This murmur is the result of blood being shunted through the VSD from the higher-pressure left ventricle into the lower-pressure right ventricle. At birth, this pressure imbalance is minimal and does not usually develop until later in the first week of life. As such, it is rare for a doctor to hear the murmur of a VSD until the baby is a few days of age.''The evaluation of a child with a possible VSD is designed to confirm the diagnosis but also to check for other anatomical defects in the heart and to estimate the size of the shunt of blood from the left to right ventricle.''Such an evaluation usually begins with an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', sometimes also abbreviated ''ECG'') and possibly a ''chest X-ray''. A soundwave test of the heart (''echocardiogram'') is used to define the anatomy and evaluate the characteristics (amount and pressures) of the shunted blood. With the advent of superb ''echocardiography'', the previously required ''cardiac catheterization'' is rarely necessary.''The infant will commonly have reduced blood oxygen levels due to shunting of the LV blood into the RV.  Most hospitals test for upper and lower blood oxygen levels (pulse ''oximetry'') prior to discharging an infant from the hospital.  Further studies and a consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should be undertaken prior to the infant being sent home. ' "
What if the VSD is small?,"'Small defects (less than 0.5 square cm) are common. With a small VSD, there is minimal shunting of blood and the pressure in the right ventricle remains normal. Since the right ventricular pressure is normal, there is no damage to the lung arterioles. The heart functions normally. A prominent murmur heard through a stethoscope is usually the only sign that brings the VSD to attention. This murmur is commonly noted during the first week of life.' "
What are treatment options for a small VSD?,"'One-third to one-half of all small VSDs close spontaneously (on their own). This seemingly miraculous event occurs most often before the baby is 1 year old, almost always before age 4 (75% by 2 years of age). The closure is due to the small VSD being located between heart fibers that increase in size in time, thus encroaching upon the opening in the ventricular septum.''Even if a small VSD does not close spontaneously, surgical repair is usually not recommended. However, long-term follow-up is required.' "
What if the VSD is large?,"'With a large VSD (usually one greater than 1 cm''2''), there is significant shunting of blood from the left ventricle into the right ventricle. Thus extra blood volume puts a strain on the right ventricle and causes an increase in the ''blood pressure'' of the lungs called ""''pulmonary hypertension''."" The child may have labored ''breathing'', difficulty feeding, poor growth, and have pallor.' "
What is the treatment for a large VSD?,"'Ultimately, the patient with a large VSD will need surgery to ""patch the hole"" in the ventricular septum. The timing of surgery is an individualized decision based upon several factors. These include' The extent and duration of increased pulmonary artery pressure are 
considered. Chronic pulmonary arteriolar pressure may become irreversible and put a strain on the right ventricle. These side effects may be treated with medications until surgery is appropriate. A child with a large VSD often will not grow as robustly as his peers. The work of increased metabolic demands often requires additional calories when compared to children without such a cardiac defect. High-calorie dense supplements may be added to formula. Some infants may require nighttime continuous feedings using a tube that is passed through the nose to the stomach (nasogastric tube) to maximize growth. It is very rare to restrict fluid volumes in these children. Infants with iron-deficiency anemia should receive iron supplements to maximize the oxygen carrying capacity of their blood. Blood transfusions to address such an anemia are rare."
What types of surgery are available to correct a VSD?,"""There are two types of surgery available to correct a VSD: the intra-cardiac technique and the trans-catheter technique. The surgical technique is chosen based upon the nature of the VSD and associated side effects on the patient's heart and lungs. The intra-cardiac approach is the most common technique and is done while the patient is under ""'cardiopulmonary bypass'' (a ""heart-lung machine"") and is an open-heart operation. This is the procedure of choice for most children and at most pediatric surgical centers. A second technique uses surgical instruments that are passed through catheters placed in the patient\'s large blood vessels into the heart. This ""trans-catheter approach"" is generally more difficult and should only be considered on select patients and at pediatric centers that have expertise in such a procedure.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) after a VSD is repaired?,"""After a successful surgical repair of the VSD, the two ventricles are entirely separate from each other and the circulation of the blood within the heart is normal. If the RV was enlarged, it can return to a more normal size. The high pressure in the pulmonary artery should also begin to resolve. If the child's growth had slowed, the child usually catches up within a year or two. Long-term follow-up is required. The long-term prognosis is usually excellent."" "
What are complications of VSD surgery?,"'Complications with intra-cardiac VSD surgery are uncommon. Currently, most centers have an operative mortality rate of less than 1% if the VSD is the only defect and the heart is functioning normally. Major complications are rare (1%-2%) and include heart rhythm problems and incomplete closure of the VSD. Rarely, a ''pacemaker'' insertion or a second procedure to repair the defect may be necessary.' "
What about unusual cases of VSD?,"'There are rare cases of VSD that may be harder to treat. These are most commonly VSDs which are associated with other cardiac defects (for example, Tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta). Cases with multiple VSDs (""Swiss cheese"" defects) are also harder to treat.' "
What are long-term precautions with VSDs?,"'Repaired or not, whether small or large, a VSD creates an increased risk for infections of the heart walls and valves (''endocarditis'""). Such an infection may be life-threatening. To help prevent endocarditis, a patient with a VSD (repaired or not) may need to take antibiotics before dental procedures, including cleaning and other dental care, and before surgical procedures on the mouth or throat. Long-term precautions should be discussed with the person's doctors. Previous recommendations for preoperative antibiotics before instrumentation of the urinary tract or lower intestinal tract were rescinded by the American Heart Association in 2007."" "
