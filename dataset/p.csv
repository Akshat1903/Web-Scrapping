Questions,Answer
What is a pacemaker?,"""A pacemaker is a small device that's placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.""'Pacemakers are used to treat arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs). Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm.'""A heartbeat that's too fast is called tachycardia (TAK-ih-KAR-de-ah). A heartbeat that's too slow is called bradycardia (bray-de-KAR-de-ah).""'During an arrhythmia, the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. This can cause symptoms such as ''fatigue'"" (tiredness), shortness of breath, or fainting. Severe arrhythmias can damage the body's vital organs and may even cause ""'loss of consciousness'' or death.''A pacemaker can relieve some arrhythmia symptoms, such as ''fatigue'' and fainting. A pacemaker also can help a person who has abnormal heart rhythms resume a more active lifestyle.' "
How do pacemakers regulate arrhythmias?,"'Faulty electrical signaling in the heart causes arrhythmias. Pacemakers use low-energy electrical pulses to overcome this faulty electrical signaling. Pacemakers can:'""Pacemakers also can monitor and record your heart's electrical activity and heart rhythm. Newer pacemakers can monitor your blood temperature, breathing rate, and other factors. They also can adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity.""""Pacemakers can be temporary or permanent. Temporary pacemakers are used to treat short-term heart problems, such as a slow heartbeat that's caused by a ""'heart attack'', heart surgery, or an overdose of medicine.'""Temporary pacemakers also are used during emergencies. They might be used until your doctor can implant a permanent pacemaker or until a temporary condition goes away. If you have a temporary pacemaker, you'll stay in a hospital as long as the device is in place.""'Permanent pacemakers are used to control long-term heart rhythm problems. This article mainly discusses permanent pacemakers, unless stated otherwise.''Doctors also treat arrhythmias with another device called an implantable cardioverter ''defibrillator'' (ICD). An ICD is similar to a pacemaker. However, besides using low-energy electrical pulses, an ICD also can use high-energy pulses to treat life-threatening arrhythmias.''Your heart has its own internal electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads from the top of your heart to the bottom. As the signal travels, it causes the heart to contract and pump blood.''Each electrical signal normally begins in a group of cells called the sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node. As the signal spreads from the top of the heart to the bottom, it coordinates the timing of heart cell activity.'""First, the heart's two upper chambers, the atria (AY-tree-uh), contract. This contraction pumps blood into the heart's two lower chambers, the ventricles (VEN-trih-kuls). The ventricles then contract and pump blood to the rest of the body. The combined contraction of the atria and ventricles is a heartbeat.""   Speed up a slow heart rhythm. Help control an abnormal or fast heart rhythm. Make sure the ventricles contract normally if the atria are quivering instead of beating with a normal rhythm (a condition called atrial fibrillation). Coordinate electrical signaling between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. Coordinate electrical signaling between the ventricles. Pacemakers that do this are called cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. CRT devices are used to treat heart failure. Prevent dangerous arrhythmias caused by a disorder called long QT syndrome."
Who needs a pacemaker?,"'Doctors recommend pacemakers for many reasons. The most common reasons are bradycardia and heart block.''Bradycardia is a heartbeat that is slower than normal. Heart block is a disorder that occurs if an electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves through the heart.''Heart block can happen as a result of ''aging'"", damage to the heart from a heart attack, or other conditions that disrupt the heart's electrical activity. Some nerve and muscle disorders also can cause heart block, including muscular dystrophy.""'Your doctor also may recommend a pacemaker if:''Doctors also may recommend pacemakers for people who have certain types of congenital ''heart disease'' or for people who have had heart transplants. Children, ''teens'', and adults can use pacemakers.''Before recommending a pacemaker, your doctor will consider any arrhythmia symptoms you have, such as ''dizziness'"", unexplained fainting, or shortness of breath. He or she also will consider whether you have a history of heart disease, what medicines you're currently taking, and the results of heart tests."" Aging or heart disease damages your sinus node's ability to set the correct pace for your heartbeat. Such damage can cause slower than normal heartbeats or long pauses between heartbeats. The damage also can cause your heart to switch between slow and fast rhythms. This condition is called sick sinus syndrome. You've had a medical procedure to treat an arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. A pacemaker can help regulate your heartbeat after the procedure. You need to take certain heart medicines, such as beta blockers. These medicines can slow your heartbeat too much. You faint or have other symptoms of a slow heartbeat. For example, this may happen if the main artery in your neck that supplies your brain with blood is sensitive to pressure. Just quickly turning your neck can cause your heart to beat slower than normal. As a result, your brain might not get enough blood flow, causing you to feel faint or collapse. You have heart muscle problems that cause electrical signals to travel too slowly through your heart muscle. Your pacemaker may provide cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for this problem. CRT devices coordinate electrical signaling between the heart's lower chambers. You have long QT syndrome, which puts you at risk for dangerous arrhythmias."
How are abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) diagnosed?,"'Many tests are used to detect arrhythmias. You may have one or more of the following tests.''An ''EKG'"" is a simple, painless test that detects and records the heart's electrical activity. The test shows how fast your heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular).""'An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through your heart. The test can help diagnose bradycardia and heart block (the most common reasons for needing a pacemaker).'""A standard EKG only records the heartbeat for a few seconds. It won't detect arrhythmias that don't happen during the test.""'To diagnose heart rhythm problems that come and go, your doctor may have you wear a portable EKG monitor. The two most common types of portable EKGs are Holter and event monitors.'""A Holter monitor records the heart's electrical activity for a full 24- or 48-hour period. You wear one while you do your normal daily activities. This allows the monitor to record your heart for a longer time than a standard EKG.""""An event monitor is similar to a Holter monitor. You wear an event monitor while doing your normal activities. However, an event monitor only records your heart's electrical activity at certain times while you're wearing it.""'For many event monitors, you push a button to start the monitor when you feel symptoms. Other event monitors start automatically when they sense abnormal heart rhythms.''You can wear an event monitor for weeks or until symptoms occur.''Echocardiography'' (echo) uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The test shows the size and shape of your heart and how well your heart chambers and valves are working.'""Echo also can show areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting normally, and injury to the heart muscle caused by poor blood flow.""""For this test, a thin, flexible wire is passed through a vein in your groin (upper thigh) or arm to your heart. The wire records the heart's electrical signals.""""Your doctor uses the wire to electrically stimulate your heart. This allows him or her to see how your heart's electrical system responds. This test helps pinpoint where the heart's electrical system is damaged.""'Some heart problems are easier to diagnose when your heart is working hard and beating fast.''During ''stress'' testing, you ''exercise'"" to make your heart work hard and beat fast while heart tests, such as an EKG or echo, are done. If you can't exercise, you may be given medicine to raise your heart rate."" "
How does a pacemaker work?,"'A pacemaker consists of a battery, a computerized generator, and wires with sensors at their tips. (The sensors are called electrodes.) The battery powers the generator, and both are surrounded by a thin metal box. The wires connect the generator to the heart.'""A pacemaker helps monitor and control your heartbeat. The electrodes detect your heart's electrical activity and send data through the wires to the computer in the generator.""'If your heart rhythm is abnormal, the computer will direct the generator to send electrical pulses to your heart. The pulses travel through the wires to reach your heart.''Newer pacemakers can monitor your blood temperature, breathing, and other factors. They also can adjust your heart rate to changes in your activity.'""The pacemaker's computer also records your heart's electrical activity and heart rhythm. Your doctor will use these recordings to adjust your pacemaker so it works better for you.""""Your doctor can program the pacemaker's computer with an external device. He or she doesn't have to use needles or have direct contact with the pacemaker.""'Pacemakers have one to three wires that are each placed in different chambers of the heart.''Types of Pacemaker Programming''The two main types of programming for pacemakers are demand pacing and rate-responsive pacing.''A demand pacemaker monitors your heart rhythm. It only sends electrical pulses to your heart if your heart is beating too slow or if it misses a beat.''A rate-responsive pacemaker will speed up or slow down your heart rate depending on how active you are. To do this, the device monitors your sinus node rate, breathing, blood temperature, and other factors to determine your activity level.''Your doctor will work with you to decide which type of pacemaker is best for you.'  The wires in a single-chamber pacemaker usually carry pulses from the generator to the right ventricle (the lower right chamber of your heart). The wires in a dual-chamber pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to the right atrium (the upper right chamber of your heart) and the right ventricle. The pulses help coordinate the timing of these two chambers' contractions. The wires in a biventricular pacemaker carry pulses from the generator to an atrium and both ventricles. The pulses help coordinate electrical signaling between the two ventricles. This type of pacemaker also is called a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device."
What should I expect during pacemaker surgery?,"'Placing a pacemaker requires minor surgery. The surgery usually is done in a hospital or special heart treatment laboratory.''Before the surgery, an intravenous (IV) line will be inserted into one of your veins. You will receive medicine through the IV line to help you relax. The medicine also might make you sleepy.'""Your doctor will numb the area where he or she will put the pacemaker so you don't feel any ""'pain''. Your doctor also may give you antibiotics to prevent infection.''First, your doctor will insert a needle into a large vein, usually near the shoulder opposite your dominant hand. Your doctor will then use the needle to thread the pacemaker wires into the vein and to correctly place them in your heart.''An x-ray ""movie"" of the wires as they pass through your vein and into your heart will help your doctor place them. Once the wires are in place, your doctor will make a small cut into the skin of your chest or abdomen.'""He or she will slip the pacemaker's small metal box through the cut, place it just under your skin, and connect it to the wires that lead to your heart. The box contains the pacemaker's battery and generator.""'Once the pacemaker is in place, your doctor will test it to make sure it works properly. He or she will then sew up the cut. The entire surgery takes a few hours.'  "
What should I expect after pacemaker surgery?,"""Expect to stay in the hospital overnight so your health care team can check your heartbeat and make sure your pacemaker is working well. You'll likely have to arrange for a ride to and from the hospital because your doctor may not want you to drive yourself.""'For a few days to weeks after surgery, you may have ''pain'', swelling, or tenderness in the area where your pacemaker was placed. The pain usually is mild; ''over-the-counter'' medicines often can relieve it. Talk to your doctor before taking any pain medicines.''Your doctor may ask you to avoid vigorous activities and heavy lifting for about a month after pacemaker surgery. Most people return to their normal activities within a few days of having the surgery.' "
What are the risks of pacemaker surgery?,"'Pacemaker surgery generally is safe. If problems do occur, they may include:''Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of pacemaker surgery.'   Swelling, bleeding, bruising, or infection in the area where the pacemaker was placed Blood vessel or nerve damage A collapsed lung A bad reaction to the medicine used during the procedure"
How will a pacemaker affect my lifestyle?,"'Once you have a pacemaker, you have to avoid close or prolonged contact with electrical devices or devices that have strong magnetic fields. Devices that can interfere with a pacemaker include:''These devices can disrupt the electrical signaling of your pacemaker and stop it from working properly. You may not be able to tell whether your pacemaker has been affected.'""How likely a device is to disrupt your pacemaker depends on how long you're exposed to it and how close it is to your pacemaker.""'To be safe, some experts recommend not putting your cell phone or MP3 player in a shirt pocket over your pacemaker (if the devices are turned on).'""You may want to hold your cell phone up to the ear that's opposite the site where your pacemaker is implanted. If you strap your MP3 player to your arm while listening to it, put it on the arm that's farther from your pacemaker.""'You can still use household appliances, but avoid close and prolonged exposure, as it may interfere with your pacemaker.'""You can walk through security system metal detectors at your normal pace. Security staff can check you with a metal detector wand as long as it isn't held for too long over your pacemaker site. You should avoid sitting or standing close to a security system metal detector. Notify security staff if you have a pacemaker.""'Also, stay at least 2 ''feet'' away from industrial welders and electrical generators.''Some medical procedures can disrupt your pacemaker. These procedures include:''Let all of your doctors, dentists, and medical technicians know that you have a pacemaker. Your doctor can give you a card that states what kind of pacemaker you have. Carry this card in your wallet. You may want to wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace that states that you have a pacemaker.' Cell phones and MP3 players (for example, iPods) Household appliances, such as microwave ovens High-tension wires Metal detectors Industrial welders Electrical generators Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI Shock-wave lithotripsy to get rid of kidney stones Electrocauterization to stop bleeding during surgery"
How often do pacemakers need to be checked?,"'Your doctor will want to check your pacemaker regularly (about every 3 months). Over time, a pacemaker can stop working properly because:''To check your pacemaker, your doctor may ask you to come in for an office visit several times a year. Some pacemaker functions can be checked remotely using a phone or the Internet.''Your doctor also may ask you to have an EKG (''electrocardiogram'"") to check for changes in your heart's electrical activity."" Its wires get dislodged or broken Its battery gets weak or fails Your heart disease progresses Other devices have disrupted its electrical signaling"
How long do pacemaker batteries last?,"'Pacemaker batteries last between 5 and 15 years (average 6 to 7 years), depending on how active the pacemaker is. Your doctor will replace the generator along with the battery before the battery starts to run down.''Replacing the generator and battery is less-involved surgery than the original surgery to implant the pacemaker. Your pacemaker wires also may need to be replaced eventually.''Your doctor can tell you whether your pacemaker or its wires need to be replaced when you see him or her for followup visits.' "
"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by. They may not be a long-term solution, but they can vastly improve your quality of life right now.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Paget disease of the breast key points," Paget disease of the breast is a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and, usually, the darker circle of skin around it, known as the areola. Most of the time, people with Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. Paget disease of the breast may be misdiagnosed at first because its early symptoms are similar to those caused by some benign skin conditions. The outlook for people diagnosed with Paget disease of the breast depends on a variety of factors, including the presence or absence of invasive cancer in the affected breast and, if invasive cancer is present, whether or not it has spread to nearby lymph nodes."
What is Paget disease of the breast?,"'Paget disease of the breast (also known as ''Paget disease of the nipple'' and mammary Paget disease) is a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and, usually, the darker circle of skin around it, which is called the areola. Most people with Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. These breast tumors are either ductal ''carcinoma in situ'' or invasive ''breast cancer''.''Paget disease of the breast is named after the 19th century British doctor Sir James Paget, who, in 1874, noted a relationship between changes in the nipple and ''breast cancer''. (Several other diseases are named after Sir James Paget, including Paget disease of bone and extramammary Paget disease, which includes Paget disease of the vulva and Paget disease of the penis. These other diseases are not related to Paget disease of the breast. This fact sheet discusses only Paget disease of the breast.)''Malignant cells known as Paget cells are a telltale sign of Paget disease of the breast. These cells are found in the ''epidermis'' (surface layer) of the skin of the nipple and the areola. Paget cells often have a large, round appearance under a microscope; they may be found as single cells or as small groups of cells within the epidermis.'  "
Who gets Paget disease of the breast?,"'Paget disease of the breast occurs in both women and men, but most cases occur in women. Approximately 1 to 4 percent of all cases of breast cancer also involve Paget disease of the breast. The average age at diagnosis is 57 years, but the disease has been found in adolescents and in people in their late 80s.' "
What causes Paget disease of the breast?,"'Doctors do not fully understand what causes Paget disease of the breast. The most widely accepted theory is that cancer cells from a tumor inside the breast travel through the milk ducts to the nipple and areola. This would explain why Paget disease of the breast and tumors inside the same breast are almost always found together.''A second theory is that cells in the nipple or areola become cancerous on their own. This would explain why a few people develop Paget disease of the breast without having a tumor inside the same breast. Moreover, it may be possible for Paget disease of the breast and tumors inside the same breast to develop independently.' "
What are the symptoms of Paget disease of the breast?,"'The symptoms of Paget disease of the breast are often mistaken for those of some benign skin conditions, such as ''dermatitis'' or ''eczema''. These symptoms may include the following:''Because the early symptoms of Paget disease of the breast may suggest a benign skin condition, and because the disease is rare, it may be misdiagnosed at first. People with Paget disease of the breast have often had symptoms for several months before being correctly diagnosed.'   Itching, tingling, or redness in the nipple and/or areola Flaking, crusty, or thickened skin on or around the nipple A flattened nipple Discharge from the nipple that may be yellowish or bloody"
How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed?,"'A nipple biopsy allows doctors to correctly diagnose Paget disease of the breast. There are several types of nipple biopsy, including the procedures described below.''In some cases, doctors may remove the entire nipple. A pathologist then examines the cells or tissue under a microscope to look for Paget cells.''Most people who have Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. In addition to ordering a nipple biopsy, the doctor should perform a clinical breast exam to check for lumps or other breast changes. As many as 50 percent of people who have Paget disease of the breast have a ''breast lump'' that can be felt in a clinical breast exam. The doctor may order additional diagnostic tests, such as a diagnostic ''mammogram'', an ''ultrasound'' exam, or a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' scan to look for possible tumors.'  Surface biopsy: A glass slide or other tool is used to gently scrape cells from the surface of the skin. Shave biopsy: A razor-like tool is used to remove the top layer of skin. Punch biopsy: A circular cutting tool, called a punch, is used to remove a disk-shaped piece of tissue. Wedge biopsy: A scalpel is used to remove a small wedge of tissue."
How is Paget disease of the breast treated?,"'For many years, mastectomy, with or without the removal of lymph nodes under the arm on the same side of chest (known as axillary ''lymph node'' dissection), was regarded as the standard surgery for Paget disease of the breast. This type of surgery was done because patients with Paget disease of the breast were almost always found to have one or more tumors inside the same breast. Even if only one tumor was present, that tumor could be located several centimeters away from the nipple and areola and would not be removed by surgery on the nipple and areola alone.''Studies have shown, however, that breast-conserving surgery that includes removal of the nipple and areola, followed by whole-breast ''radiation'' therapy, is a safe option for people with Paget disease of the breast who do not have a palpable lump in their breast and whose mammograms do not reveal a tumor.''People with Paget disease of the breast who have a breast tumor and are having a mastectomy should be offered ''sentinel lymph node biopsy'' to see whether the cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes. If cancer cells are found in the sentinel lymph node(s), more extensive axillary lymph node surgery may be needed. Depending on the stage and other features of the underlying breast tumor (for example, the presence or absence of lymph node involvement, estrogen and ''progesterone'' receptors in the tumor cells, and HER2 protein overexpression in the tumor cells), adjuvant therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, may also be recommended.'  "
What is the prognosis for people with Paget disease of the breast?,"'The prognosis, or outlook, for people with Paget disease of the breast depends on a variety of factors, including the following:''The presence of invasive cancer in the affected breast and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes are associated with reduced survival.'""According to NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the 5-year relative survival for all women in the United States who were diagnosed with Paget disease of the breast between 1988 and 2001 was 82.6 percent. This compares with a 5-year relative survival of 87.1 percent for women diagnosed with any type of breast cancer. For women with both Paget disease of the breast and invasive cancer in the same breast, the 5-year relative survival declined with increasing stage of the cancer (stage I, 95.8 percent; stage II, 77.7 percent; stage III, 46.3 percent; stage IV, 14.3 percent)."" Whether or not a tumor is present in the affected breast If one or more tumors are present in the affected breast, whether those tumors are ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer If invasive breast cancer is present in the affected breast, the stage of that cancer"
What research studies are under way on Paget disease of the breast?,"'Randomized controlled ''clinical trials'', which are considered the ""gold standard"" in cancer research, are difficult to perform for Paget disease of the breast because very few people have this disease (4, 10). However, people who have Paget disease of the breast may be eligible to enroll in clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for breast cancer in general, new ways of using existing breast cancer treatments, or strategies for preventing ''breast cancer recurrence''.''Information about current breast cancer treatment clinical trials is available by searching NCI\'s list of cancer clinical trials. ""Paget disease"" can be used as a key word to limit the search results.'""Alternatively, contact NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) for information about clinical trials."" "
What is Paget's disease?,"'Paget\'s disease is a chronic condition of bone characterized by disorder of the normal bone remodeling process. Normal bone has a balance of forces that act to lay down new bone and take up old bone. This relationship (referred to as ""bone remodeling"") is essential for maintaining the normal calcium levels in our blood. In bone affected by Paget\'s disease, one or more localized areas of bone are affected by abnormal bone remodeling, which is disturbed and not synchronized. As a result, the bone that is formed is abnormal, enlarged, not as dense, brittle, and prone to breakage (''fracture'').'""Paget's disease affects older skeletal bone of adults. It's estimated that 1% of adults in the U.S. have Paget's disease. There is also an extremely rare form of Paget's disease in children, referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. Paget's disease is also known as osteitis deformans and Paget disease."" "
What are the types of Paget's disease?,"'There are two types of '""Paget's disease of bone"""". When a single site of bone is affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the monostotic type. When multiple sites of bone are affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the polyostotic type."" "
What causes Paget's disease?,"""It is not known what causes Paget's disease. Paget's disease is felt to be a disease of a particular cell that is responsible for bone resorption, the osteoclast."" "
What are risk factors for Paget's disease?,"""The onset of Paget's disease is typically after 55 years of age. Recently, certain genes have been associated with Paget's disease, including the Sequestrosome 1 gene on chromosome 5. Virus infection may be necessary to trigger Paget's disease in people who have ""'inherited'"" the genetic tendency to develop the condition by having these genes. Paget's disease is inherited in approximately one-third of patients. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a patient with the condition to have a family history of the disease."" "
Who discovered Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is named after the English surgeon Sir James Paget, who described the condition in 1877. Paget also discovered the worm that causes ""'trichinosis'' and described what is called '""Paget's disease of the breast""'. Together with Rudolph Virchow in Germany, Paget was one of the founders of pathology.' "
What are Paget's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Paget's disease causes no symptoms in a majority of those with the condition and is often incidentally noted when X-ray tests are obtained for other reasons. However, Paget's disease can cause bone pain, deformity, fracture, and ""'arthritis'"". The bone pain of Paget's disease is located in the affected area of bone. The most common bones affected by Paget's disease include the spine, the thigh bone (femur), the pelvis, the skull, the collarbone (clavicle), and the upper arm bone (humerus). Fractures can occur because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone. Arthritis occurs because of the deformity of affected bone adjacent to the joint and because of bowing of affected long bones. The type of arthritis that results is ""'osteoarthritis''.'""The symptoms of Paget's disease depend on the bones affected and the severity of the disease. Enlarged bones can pinch adjacent nerves, causing tingling and numbness. Bowing of the legs can occur. Hip or knee involvement can lead to arthritis, ""'limping'', as well as pain and ''stiffness'' of the hip or knee. ''Headache'', ''loss of vision'', and ''hearing loss'"" can occur when bones of the skull are affected. With very widespread Paget's disease, it is possible to develop ""'congestive heart failure'' due to an increased workload on the ''heart''. Sometimes the skin overlying the involved bone is warmer than usual. This is because of the increased blood supply to pagetic bone.'  "
What specialties of doctors diagnose and treat Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is treated by generalists, including general and family medicine doctors and internists, as well as specialists including ""'rheumatologists'', orthopedic surgeons, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians) for ''hearing'"" loss. Frequently, the care of individuals with Paget's disease is a coordinated effort between several health care professionals depending on its location, symptoms, and complications."" "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease?,"""Health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease based on the X-ray appearance. Doctors also may detect Paget's disease with other imaging tests, such as a ""'bone scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and ''CT scan'' to make a diagnosis. ''Alkaline phosphatase'"", an enzyme that comes from bone, is frequently elevated in the blood of people with Paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. This blood test is also referred to as the serum ""'alkaline phosphatase'"" (SAP) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of Paget's disease.""""The bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of Paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. Bone that is affected by Paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images. A bone biopsy is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis of Paget's disease.

Bone pain can require anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") or pain-relieving medicines. Bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear. Surgery may be necessary for damaged joints, fractures, severely deformed bones, or when nerves are being pinched by enlarged bone.

Paget disease of the breast key points," Paget disease of the breast is a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and, usually, the darker circle of skin around it, known as the areola. Most of the time, people with Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. Paget disease of the breast may be misdiagnosed at first because its early symptoms are similar to those caused by some benign skin conditions. The outlook for people diagnosed with Paget disease of the breast depends on a variety of factors, including the presence or absence of invasive cancer in the affected breast and, if invasive cancer is present, whether or not it has spread to nearby lymph nodes."
What is Paget disease of the breast?,"'Paget disease of the breast (also known as ''Paget disease of the nipple'' and mammary Paget disease) is a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple and, usually, the darker circle of skin around it, which is called the areola. Most people with Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. These breast tumors are either ductal ''carcinoma in situ'' or invasive ''breast cancer''.''Paget disease of the breast is named after the 19th century British doctor Sir James Paget, who, in 1874, noted a relationship between changes in the nipple and ''breast cancer''. (Several other diseases are named after Sir James Paget, including Paget disease of bone and extramammary Paget disease, which includes Paget disease of the vulva and Paget disease of the penis. These other diseases are not related to Paget disease of the breast. This fact sheet discusses only Paget disease of the breast.)''Malignant cells known as Paget cells are a telltale sign of Paget disease of the breast. These cells are found in the ''epidermis'' (surface layer) of the skin of the nipple and the areola. Paget cells often have a large, round appearance under a microscope; they may be found as single cells or as small groups of cells within the epidermis.'  "
Who gets Paget disease of the breast?,"'Paget disease of the breast occurs in both women and men, but most cases occur in women. Approximately 1 to 4 percent of all cases of breast cancer also involve Paget disease of the breast. The average age at diagnosis is 57 years, but the disease has been found in adolescents and in people in their late 80s.' "
What causes Paget disease of the breast?,"'Doctors do not fully understand what causes Paget disease of the breast. The most widely accepted theory is that cancer cells from a tumor inside the breast travel through the milk ducts to the nipple and areola. This would explain why Paget disease of the breast and tumors inside the same breast are almost always found together.''A second theory is that cells in the nipple or areola become cancerous on their own. This would explain why a few people develop Paget disease of the breast without having a tumor inside the same breast. Moreover, it may be possible for Paget disease of the breast and tumors inside the same breast to develop independently.' "
What are the symptoms of Paget disease of the breast?,"'The symptoms of Paget disease of the breast are often mistaken for those of some benign skin conditions, such as ''dermatitis'' or ''eczema''. These symptoms may include the following:''Because the early symptoms of Paget disease of the breast may suggest a benign skin condition, and because the disease is rare, it may be misdiagnosed at first. People with Paget disease of the breast have often had symptoms for several months before being correctly diagnosed.'   Itching, tingling, or redness in the nipple and/or areola Flaking, crusty, or thickened skin on or around the nipple A flattened nipple Discharge from the nipple that may be yellowish or bloody"
How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed?,"'A nipple biopsy allows doctors to correctly diagnose Paget disease of the breast. There are several types of nipple biopsy, including the procedures described below.''In some cases, doctors may remove the entire nipple. A pathologist then examines the cells or tissue under a microscope to look for Paget cells.''Most people who have Paget disease of the breast also have one or more tumors inside the same breast. In addition to ordering a nipple biopsy, the doctor should perform a clinical breast exam to check for lumps or other breast changes. As many as 50 percent of people who have Paget disease of the breast have a ''breast lump'' that can be felt in a clinical breast exam. The doctor may order additional diagnostic tests, such as a diagnostic ''mammogram'', an ''ultrasound'' exam, or a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' scan to look for possible tumors.'  Surface biopsy: A glass slide or other tool is used to gently scrape cells from the surface of the skin. Shave biopsy: A razor-like tool is used to remove the top layer of skin. Punch biopsy: A circular cutting tool, called a punch, is used to remove a disk-shaped piece of tissue. Wedge biopsy: A scalpel is used to remove a small wedge of tissue."
How is Paget disease of the breast treated?,"'For many years, mastectomy, with or without the removal of lymph nodes under the arm on the same side of chest (known as axillary ''lymph node'' dissection), was regarded as the standard surgery for Paget disease of the breast. This type of surgery was done because patients with Paget disease of the breast were almost always found to have one or more tumors inside the same breast. Even if only one tumor was present, that tumor could be located several centimeters away from the nipple and areola and would not be removed by surgery on the nipple and areola alone.''Studies have shown, however, that breast-conserving surgery that includes removal of the nipple and areola, followed by whole-breast ''radiation'' therapy, is a safe option for people with Paget disease of the breast who do not have a palpable lump in their breast and whose mammograms do not reveal a tumor.''People with Paget disease of the breast who have a breast tumor and are having a mastectomy should be offered ''sentinel lymph node biopsy'' to see whether the cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes. If cancer cells are found in the sentinel lymph node(s), more extensive axillary lymph node surgery may be needed. Depending on the stage and other features of the underlying breast tumor (for example, the presence or absence of lymph node involvement, estrogen and ''progesterone'' receptors in the tumor cells, and HER2 protein overexpression in the tumor cells), adjuvant therapy, consisting of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, may also be recommended.'  "
What is the prognosis for people with Paget disease of the breast?,"'The prognosis, or outlook, for people with Paget disease of the breast depends on a variety of factors, including the following:''The presence of invasive cancer in the affected breast and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes are associated with reduced survival.'""According to NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the 5-year relative survival for all women in the United States who were diagnosed with Paget disease of the breast between 1988 and 2001 was 82.6 percent. This compares with a 5-year relative survival of 87.1 percent for women diagnosed with any type of breast cancer. For women with both Paget disease of the breast and invasive cancer in the same breast, the 5-year relative survival declined with increasing stage of the cancer (stage I, 95.8 percent; stage II, 77.7 percent; stage III, 46.3 percent; stage IV, 14.3 percent)."" Whether or not a tumor is present in the affected breast If one or more tumors are present in the affected breast, whether those tumors are ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer If invasive breast cancer is present in the affected breast, the stage of that cancer"
What research studies are under way on Paget disease of the breast?,"'Randomized controlled ''clinical trials'', which are considered the ""gold standard"" in cancer research, are difficult to perform for Paget disease of the breast because very few people have this disease (4, 10). However, people who have Paget disease of the breast may be eligible to enroll in clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for breast cancer in general, new ways of using existing breast cancer treatments, or strategies for preventing ''breast cancer recurrence''.''Information about current breast cancer treatment clinical trials is available by searching NCI\'s list of cancer clinical trials. ""Paget disease"" can be used as a key word to limit the search results.'""Alternatively, contact NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) for information about clinical trials."" "
What is Paget's disease?,"'Paget\'s disease is a chronic condition of bone characterized by disorder of the normal bone remodeling process. Normal bone has a balance of forces that act to lay down new bone and take up old bone. This relationship (referred to as ""bone remodeling"") is essential for maintaining the normal calcium levels in our blood. In bone affected by Paget\'s disease, one or more localized areas of bone are affected by abnormal bone remodeling, which is disturbed and not synchronized. As a result, the bone that is formed is abnormal, enlarged, not as dense, brittle, and prone to breakage (''fracture'').'""Paget's disease affects older skeletal bone of adults. It's estimated that 1% of adults in the U.S. have Paget's disease. There is also an extremely rare form of Paget's disease in children, referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. Paget's disease is also known as osteitis deformans and Paget disease."" "
What are the types of Paget's disease?,"'There are two types of '""Paget's disease of bone"""". When a single site of bone is affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the monostotic type. When multiple sites of bone are affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the polyostotic type."" "
What causes Paget's disease?,"""It is not known what causes Paget's disease. Paget's disease is felt to be a disease of a particular cell that is responsible for bone resorption, the osteoclast."" "
What are risk factors for Paget's disease?,"""The onset of Paget's disease is typically after 55 years of age. Recently, certain genes have been associated with Paget's disease, including the Sequestrosome 1 gene on chromosome 5. Virus infection may be necessary to trigger Paget's disease in people who have ""'inherited'"" the genetic tendency to develop the condition by having these genes. Paget's disease is inherited in approximately one-third of patients. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a patient with the condition to have a family history of the disease."" "
Who discovered Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is named after the English surgeon Sir James Paget, who described the condition in 1877. Paget also discovered the worm that causes ""'trichinosis'' and described what is called '""Paget's disease of the breast""'. Together with Rudolph Virchow in Germany, Paget was one of the founders of pathology.' "
What are Paget's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Paget's disease causes no symptoms in a majority of those with the condition and is often incidentally noted when X-ray tests are obtained for other reasons. However, Paget's disease can cause bone pain, deformity, fracture, and ""'arthritis'"". The bone pain of Paget's disease is located in the affected area of bone. The most common bones affected by Paget's disease include the spine, the thigh bone (femur), the pelvis, the skull, the collarbone (clavicle), and the upper arm bone (humerus). Fractures can occur because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone. Arthritis occurs because of the deformity of affected bone adjacent to the joint and because of bowing of affected long bones. The type of arthritis that results is ""'osteoarthritis''.'""The symptoms of Paget's disease depend on the bones affected and the severity of the disease. Enlarged bones can pinch adjacent nerves, causing tingling and numbness. Bowing of the legs can occur. Hip or knee involvement can lead to arthritis, ""'limping'', as well as pain and ''stiffness'' of the hip or knee. ''Headache'', ''loss of vision'', and ''hearing loss'"" can occur when bones of the skull are affected. With very widespread Paget's disease, it is possible to develop ""'congestive heart failure'' due to an increased workload on the ''heart''. Sometimes the skin overlying the involved bone is warmer than usual. This is because of the increased blood supply to pagetic bone.'  "
What specialties of doctors diagnose and treat Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is treated by generalists, including general and family medicine doctors and internists, as well as specialists including ""'rheumatologists'', orthopedic surgeons, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians) for ''hearing'"" loss. Frequently, the care of individuals with Paget's disease is a coordinated effort between several health care professionals depending on its location, symptoms, and complications."" "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease?,"""Health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease based on the X-ray appearance. Doctors also may detect Paget's disease with other imaging tests, such as a ""'bone scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and ''CT scan'' to make a diagnosis. ''Alkaline phosphatase'"", an enzyme that comes from bone, is frequently elevated in the blood of people with Paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. This blood test is also referred to as the serum ""'alkaline phosphatase'"" (SAP) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of Paget's disease.""""The bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of Paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. Bone that is affected by Paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images. A bone biopsy is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis of Paget's disease. Bone biopsy would be considered if there was a suspicion of ""'cancer'' or abnormal lesion in the involved bone.' "
What is the medical treatment for Paget's disease?,"""The medical treatment of Paget's disease is directed toward controlling the disease activity and managing its complications. When Paget's disease causes no symptoms and blood testing shows that the level of serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or minimally elevated, no treatment may be necessary. Bone pain can require anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") or pain-relieving medicines. Bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear.

Introduction,"'The majority of people with ''cancer'' will experience ''pain'' at some time or another. The ''pain'' can result from the ''cancer'' itself, or from the ''cancers'' treatment. In addition, some people who have been cured of their ''cancer'' can continue to suffer from pain.''Cancer pain, or the discomfort that stems from cancer and its treatment, can be controlled most of the time. There are many different medicines and methods available to control cancer pain. People who have cancer and are feeling pain need to inform their doctor immediately. The earlier pain treatment is started, the more effective it is.' "
What Causes Cancer Pain?,"'There are many ''causes of cancer'' pain, but most cancer pain occurs when a ''tumor'' presses on nerves or body organs or when cancer cells invade bones or body organs. Cancer treatments such as ''chemotherapy'', ''radiation'', or surgery also may cause pain.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Cancer Pain?,"""The symptoms of cancer pain vary from person to person. The amount of pain present may depend on the type of cancer, the stage or extent of the disease, and the person's pain threshold (tolerance for pain). Pain can range from mild and occasional to severe and constant."" "
What Medicines Are Used To Treat Cancer Pain?,"'Mild to Moderate Pain''Pain relievers:'' ''Tylenol'' and a group of pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' and ''Aleve'') can treat mild to moderate pain. Many of these are ''over-the-counter'' drugs that do not require a prescription, but some do require a prescription. Patients should check with a physician before using these medicines, especially if chemotherapy is being administered. NSAIDs can slow blood clotting.''Moderate to Severe Pain''Narcotic pain relievers:'' These drugs include morphine, ''Actiq'', ''Duragesic'', ''Dilaudid'', ''oxycodone'' (sold under the brand names ''OxyContin'', ''Percocet'', and ''Tylox'') and ''codeine''. Narcotic pain relievers require a prescription and may be used along with mild pain relievers for moderate to severe pain.''Breakthrough Pain''Onset narcotic pain relievers:'' Onset narcotic pain relievers, which require a prescription, are used to treat breakthrough pain (a flare-up of pain characterized by rapid onset, severe intensity and short duration). Immediate-release oral morphine is among these drugs.''Tingling and Burning Pain' Antidepressants: antidepressants are used to relieve pain regardless of if the person is depressed. Elavil, Pamelor, Norpramine are antidepressants prescribed to treat pain. Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications): Despite the name, anticonvulsants are used not only for seizures, but also to control burning and tingling pain, painful symptoms of nerve damage. Tegretol and Neurontin require prescriptions Other drugs: Corticosteroids such as Deltasone are used to lessen swelling, which often causes pain."
How Else Can Cancer Pain Be Treated?,"'Although cancer pain is usually treated with medicine, surgery to remove a tumor or ''radiation therapy'' to shrink a tumor can be used along with medicine to provide additional pain relief. In most cases, doctors treat cancer pain with pain-relief medicines called analgesics or with non-drug treatments such as physical therapy and rehabilitation, imagery, biofeedback and relaxation techniques. Other treatment options for cancer patients include ''nerve blocks'' , which involve the injection of pain medicine into or around a nerve or the spine; and neurosurgery, a procedure in which pain nerves are cut to alleviate pain.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Neuroscience Center.''Edited by Charlotte E.

"What is the design of the elbow, and what is its function?","'The elbow is the joint where three long bones meet in the middle portion of the arm. The bone of the upper arm (humerus) meets the inner bone of the forearm (ulna) and the outer bone of the forearm (radius) to form a hinge joint. The radius and ulna also meet in the elbow to allow for rotation of the forearm. The elbow functions to move the arm like a hinge (forward and backward) and in rotation (twisting outward and inward). The biceps muscle is the major muscle that flexes the elbow hinge. The triceps muscle is the major muscle that extends the elbow hinge. The outer bone of the elbow is referred to as the lateral epicondyle and is a part of the humerus bone. Tendons are attached to this area which can be injured, causing inflammation or tendinitis (''lateral epicondylitis'', or ""''tennis elbow''""). The inner portion of the elbow is a bony prominence called the medial epicondyle. Additional tendons from the muscles attach here and can be injured, causing medial epicondylitis, ""golfer\'s elbow."" A fluid-filled sac (bursa), which serves to reduce friction, overlies the tip of the elbow (olecranon bursa). The elbow can be affected by inflammation of the tendons or the bursae (plural for bursa) or conditions that affect the bones and joints, such as ''fractures'', ''arthritis'', or nerve irritation. ''Joint pain'' in the elbow can result from injury or disease involving any of these structures.'  "
What injuries can cause elbow pain? What signs and symptoms may be associated with elbow pain?,"'Olecranon ''bursitis'' (inflammation of the bursa at the tip of the elbow) can occur from injury or minor ''trauma'' as a result of systemic diseases such as ''gout'' or ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or it can be due to a local infection. Olecranon bursitis is typically associated with swelling over the tip of the elbow, while range of motion of the inner elbow joint is maintained.''The bones of the elbow can break (''fracture'') into the elbow joint or adjacent to the elbow joint. Typically, elbow fracture causes sharp pain in the elbow, and X-ray imaging is used to make a diagnosis. Fractures generally require immobilization and casts and can require orthopedic surgery, involving pinning or open joint procedures.''A sprain is a stretch or tear injury to a ligament. One or more ligaments can be injured during a sprain. This might occur when the elbow is hyperextended or simply jammed, such as in a ""stiffarm"" collision. The severity of the injury will depend on the extent of injury to a single ligament (whether the tear is partial or complete) and the number of ligaments involved. Treatment involves rest, ice, immobilization, compression, and anti-inflammation medications.'   Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow): The lateral epicondyle is the outside bony portion of the elbow where large tendons attach to the elbow from the muscles of the forearm. These tendons can be injured, especially with repetitive motions of the forearm, such as using a manual screwdriver, washing windows, or hitting a backhand in tennis play. Tennis elbow then leads to inflammation of the tendons, causing pain over the outside of the elbow, occasionally with warmth and swelling but always with local tenderness. The elbow maintains its full range of motion, as the inner joint is not affected, and the pain can be particularly noticed toward the end of the day. Repeated twisting motions or activities that strain the tendon typically elicit increased pain. These include lifting and throwing. X-rays are usually normal, but if chronic tendinitis has occurred, X-rays can reveal calcium deposits in the tendon or reveal other unforeseen abnormalities of the elbow joint.The treatment of lateral epicondylitis may include ice packs, resting the involved elbow, and anti-inflammatory medications. Anti-inflammatory medications typically used include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen (Naprosyn), diclofenac (Voltaren), and ibuprofen (Motrin). Bracing the elbow can help. Simple braces for tennis elbow can be found in community pharmacies and athletic goods stores. Local cortisone injections are given for persistent pain. Activity involving the elbow is resumed gradually. Ice application after activity can reduce or prevent recurrent inflammation. Occasionally, supportive straps can prevent reinjury. In severe cases, an orthopedic surgical repair is performed. Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow): Medial epicondylitis is inflammation at the point where the tendons of the forearm attach to the bony prominence of the inner elbow. As an example, this tendon can become strained in a golf swing, but many other repetitive motions can injure the tendon. Golfer's elbow is characterized by local pain and tenderness over the inner elbow. The range of motion of the elbow is preserved because the inner joint of the elbow is not affected. Those activities which require twisting or straining the forearm tendon can elicit pain and worsen the condition. X-rays for epicondylitis are usually normal but can indicate calcifications of the tendons if the tendinitis has persisted for extended periods of time.The usual treatment involves combinations of ice packs, resting the elbow, and medications including aspirin and other NSAIDs. With severe inflammation, local corticosteroid (cortisone) injections are sometimes given. Using a strap can prevent reinjury. After a gradual rehabilitation exercise program, return to usual activity is best accompanied by ice applications after use. This helps to avoid recurrent inflammation."
What are diseases and conditions that can cause elbow pain?,"'Inflammation of the elbow joint (arthritis) can occur as a result of many systemic forms of arthritis, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''osteoarthritis'', ''gouty arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease). Generally, they are associated with signs of inflammation of the elbow joint, including heat, warmth, swelling, pain, tenderness, and decreased range of motion. Range of motion of the elbow is decreased with arthritis of the elbow because the swollen joint impedes the range of motion.""'Inflammation of the skin related to infection (''cellulitis'') commonly occurs as a result of abrasions of the skin. When abrasions or ''puncture wounds'' occur, bacteria on the surface of the skin can invade the deeper layers of the skin. This causes inflamed skin characterized by redness, warmth, and swelling. The most common bacteria that cause cellulitis include '' ''Staphylococcus'' and '' ''Streptococcus''. Patients can have an associated low-grade ''fever''. Cellulitis generally requires antibiotic treatment, either orally or intravenously. Heat application can help in the healing process. Cellulitis can lead to infection of the olecranon bursa, causing olecranon bursitis, as described above.''Infection of the elbow joint with bacteria (''septic arthritis'') is uncommon. It is most often seen in patients with suppressed immune systems or ''diabetes'', those taking cortisone medications, or intravenous drug abusers. The most common bacteria that cause infection of the elbow joint are ''Staphylococcus'' and ''Streptococcus''. Septic arthritis of the elbow requires antibiotic treatment and often surgical drainage. It is characterized by heat, swelling, redness, and pain, with limited range of motion of the elbow joint. Septic arthritis is often associated with ''fever'', sweats, and ''chills''.''Osteochondritis dissecans'' is an uncommon disease of cartilage in the joint whereby the cartilage effectively flakes away from the bone. This can lead to locking, pain, and loss of range of motion of the elbow. Osteochondritis dissecans is diagnosed by ''MRI'' scan or contrast ''CT scan'' imaging of the involved elbow joint. This is generally treated by arthroscopic surgical repair and removal of the diseased cartilage.''Bone tumors of the elbow joint are rare. Primary ''bone cancer'' can occur. It can be painless or associated with pain in the elbow joint. It is usually detectable by X-ray testing. Nuclear medicine bone scanning can also be helpful for detection.''The ulnar nerve is the ""funny bone"" nerve which travels between the tip of the elbow and the inner elbow bone. At this site it can be ""pinched"" by normal structures or swollen structures after injury. This pinching is referred to as entrapment. When ulnar ''nerve entrapment'' occurs, numbness and tingling of the little and ring finger of the hand may be felt. Pain may occur in the entire forearm, usually the inner side. Hand dexterity can be affected. Sometimes, the numbness is reproduced by elevating the hand. Treatment consists of avoiding repeated trauma or pressure to the elbow area and resting the elbow joint. Occasionally, ice can help. In severe cases, surgical repositioning of the ulnar nerve can be required. This relocates the ulnar nerve to a position where it will not be continually compressed by the surrounding structures.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose elbow pain?,"'Elbow pain'' is most commonly diagnosed simply with a review of the history and physical examination. Most causes of elbow pain require no further testing. As described above, for some diseases, further testing can include X-ray examination, MRI scanning, arthrogram testing, and aspiration of fluid from the involved elbow area.' "
What are treatments for elbow pain?,"'The treatment for elbow pain depends on the precise cause of the pain. Treatments for simple inflammation can include immobilization, anti-inflammatory medications, and ''cold'' application. Treatments for fracture include casting and surgical repair. Treatments for infection include drainage and antibiotics.' "
What is the prognosis of elbow pain?,'The outlook for elbow pain depends on the particular cause as described above.' 
Is it possible to prevent elbow pain?,"'To the extent that injuries can be avoided, most causes of elbow pain can be prevented.' "
What is gallbladder pain?,"'Gallbladder ''pain'' is (often misspelled ""gall bladder"") an all-inclusive term used to describe any ''pain'' due to disease related to the gallbladder. The major gallbladder problems that produce gallbladder ''pain'' are biliary ''colic'', cholecystitis, ''gallstones'', ''pancreatitis'', and ascending cholangitis. Symptoms vary and may be triggered by eating certain foods. The pain may be described as intermittent, constant, abdominal, radiating to the back, mild to severe depending on the underlying cause.''A brief review of the gallbladder anatomy and function may help readers better understand gallbladder pain. The gallbladder is connected to the ''liver'' via ducts that supply bile to the gallbladder for storage. These bile ducts then form the common hepatic duct that joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct that empties into the GI tract (duodenum). In addition, the pancreatic duct usually merges with the common bile duct just before it enters the duodenum. Hormones trigger the gallbladder to release bile when fat and amino acids reach the duodenum after eating a meal (see illustration below), which facilitates the ''digestion'' of these foods. Statistics suggest that women may have up to twice the incidence of ''gallstones'' than men.' "
What are the causes of gallbladder pain?,"'As stated previously, the major gallbladder problems that produce gallbladder pain are biliary ''colic'', cholecystitis, ''gallstones'', ''pancreatitis'', and ascending cholangitis. There are two major causes of pain that either originate from the gallbladder or involve the gallbladder directly. They are due to 1) intermittent or complete blockage of any of the ducts by ''gallstones''; or 2) gallstone sludge and/or inflammation that may accompany irritation or infection of the surrounding tissues, when partial or complete obstruction of ducts causes pressure and ischemia (inadequate blood supply due to a blockage of blood vessels in the area) to develop in the adjacent tissues.''Gallstone formation usually happens in the gallbladder, but may form in any of the ducts. When the gallbladder is compressed (squeezed by musculature), bile usually goes out through the bile ducts into the GI tract; however, if gallstones or gallstone sludge is present, there can be partial or complete blockage of the ducts with pressure on the surrounding tissue, sometimes enough to cause local ischemia. Other processes such as ''trauma'' can cause gallbladder pain. Infection of the biliary ducts and the gallbladder, usually occurring after gallstone obstruction also can cause pain.'  "
What is biliary colic?,"'Biliary ''colic'' is a term used to describe the type of pain related to the gallbladder, when the gallbladder contracts and the cystic duct is partially or completely blocked by a gallstone. The symptoms are described below.' "
What are other signs and symptoms of gallbladder pain?,"'Gallbladder pain may vary or feel different depending on the cause. Many people with gallstones never experience pain. However, there are some variations in gallbladder pain that help the doctor to make a diagnosis.'   Biliary colic (intermittent duct blockage): Sudden and rapidly increasing pain (ache or pressure) in the right upper abdomen or epigastric area; some people will have pain radiating to the right shoulder (or back pain in the tip of the scapula) and/or also develop nausea and vomiting. The pain usually subsides in about 1 to 5 hours although a mild ache may persist for about a day. Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder tissue secondary to duct blockage): severe steady pain in the upper-right abdomen that may radiate to the right shoulder or back, abdominal tenderness when touched or pressed, sweating, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and bloating; discomfort lasts longer than with biliary colic. Acalculous cholecystitis (no gallstones) has similar symptoms to cholecystitis but occurs as a complication of other problems like trauma or burns; patients have severe symptoms and appear very ill. Pancreatitis: Gallstones from the gallbladder can block the pancreatic duct and cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) with upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, tender abdomen, more pain after eating, with nausea and vomiting. Ascending cholangitis (or simply cholangitis or infection of the biliary system) causes symptoms and signs that include fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and even hypotension (low blood pressure), and confusion; it is a medical emergency."
How is the cause of gallbladder pain diagnosed?,"""The history and physical exam helps to establish a presumptive diagnosis. Murphy's sign (pain or temporary respiratory arrest on deep right subcostal palpation) has been estimated to be over 95% specific for acute cholecystitis. A few laboratory blood tests such as ""'liver function'' tests, lipase, amylase, ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), and an abdominal X-ray are done to determine the exact problem is causing the pain.\xa0''Ultrasound'' can detect gallstones, and ''CT scan'' may delineate organ structural changes. A ''HIDA scan'' (uses radioactive material) can measure gallbladder emptying while an ''ERCP'' test uses an endoscope to place dye in the ducts of the pancreas, gallbladder, and ''liver''. ''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is sometimes used to detail the organ structures (liver, gallbladder, and pancreas); other tests also may be considered. The results of these tests help pinpoint the problem and establish the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment of gallbladder pain?,"'If you have no gallbladder pain (even if you have gallstones but never had pain), you need no treatment. Some patients who have had one or two gallstone attacks may elect to avoid treatment. Pain during an acute gallstone attack is often treated with morphine. Medical treatments include''The definitive treatment is gallbladder removal surgery (and/or the obstructing gallstones). Currently, the surgical method of choice is laparoscopic surgery, where the gallbladder is removed by instruments using only small incisions in the abdomen. However, some patients may require more extensive surgery. Usually, people do well once the gallbladder is removed unless there is an underlying cause that mimics gallbladder pain (for example, biliary ''dyskinesia'', a motility disorder of sphincter of Oddi).''Women who are ''pregnant'' are treated like women who are not ''pregnant'', although pregnant women more commonly have ''cholesterol'' gallstone development than non-pregnant women. Although supportive care is tried in women who are pregnant, acute cholecystitis is the second most common surgical emergency in ''pregnancy'' (''appendicitis'' is the first).'   oral bile salt therapy (<50% effective), ursodiol (Actigall, for example) dissolution, and lithotripsy (shock waves)."
Home remedies for relief of gallbladder pain," Home remedies include peppermint, alfalfa, apple cider vinegar, and others; you should check with your doctor before using these remedies. Following a low-fat diet may reduce the frequency of biliary colic but has not been shown to dissolve gallstones. Coffee and regular exercise may reduce the incidence of gallstone disease and its associated gallbladder pain. Some health-care professional recommend decreasing dairy and grains in the diet after gallbladder removal; again, individuals should discuss such changes with their doctor."
What are the complications of gallbladder pain?,"'The complications of gallbladder pain include''Other complications of gallbladder disease include'   discomfort with eating, poor food intake, weight loss, electrolyte abnormalities, consumption of pain medications, and disruption of daily activities. bile duct blockage, serious infections (empyema and gangrene of the gallbladder), pancreatitis, peritonitis, and infrequently, gallbladder cancer."
What is a heel spur? What are heel spur symptoms?,"'A heel spur is a pointed bony outgrowth of the bone of the heel (the calcaneus bone). Chronic local inflammation at the insertion of soft-tissue tendons or plantar fascia is a common cause of ''bone spurs'' (''osteophytes''). Heel spurs can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, beneath the arch of the foot. Heel spurs at the back of the heel are frequently associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (tendinitis) and cause tenderness and heel ''pain'' made worse while pushing off the ball of the foot.'  "
How do heel spurs relate to plantar fasciitis? What causes heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs under the sole of the foot (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (plantar fasciitis), the ""bowstring-like"" ligament stretching underneath the sole that attaches at the heel. Plantar heel spurs cause localized tenderness and heel\xa0''pain'' made worse when stepping down on the heel.''Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases that cause ''arthritis'' (inflammation of the joints), such as ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease), ""'ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'' (DISH). It is important to note that heel spurs may cause no symptoms at all and may be incidentally discovered during X-ray exams taken for other purposes.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are diagnosed based on the history of heel pain and tenderness localized to the area of bony involvement. They are specifically identified when there is point tenderness at the bottom of the heel, which makes it difficult to walk barefoot on hard surfaces, like tile or wood floors. X-ray examination of the foot is used to identify the bony prominence (spur) of the heel bone (calcaneus).' "
What are heel spur treatment options? Are there any home remedies for heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are treated by measures that decrease the associated inflammation and avoid reinjury. Local ice applications both reduce pain and inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') and\xa0''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or injections of cortisone, are often helpful.''Orthotic devices or shoe inserts are used to take pressure off plantar spurs (donut-shaped insert), and heel lifts can reduce ''stress'' on the Achilles tendon to relieve painful bone spurs at the back of the heel. Similarly, sports ''running'' shoes with soft, cushioned soles can be helpful in reducing irritation of inflamed tissues from heel spurs. Infrequently, surgery is performed on chronically inflamed spurs.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) of heel spurs?,"'The long-term outlook is generally good. The inflammation usually responds to conservative, nonsurgical treatments, like anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' and orthotics. Infrequently, surgical intervention is necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent heel spurs?,'Treating any underlying associated inflammatory disease can prevent heel spurs.' 
What are the kidneys?,"'The kidneys are two organs whose major functions are to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body and to produce hormones that regulate ''blood pressure'', red blood cell production, acid regulation and to influence calcium, sodium, potassium and other ''electrolyte'' metabolism.'  "
Where are the kidneys located?,"'The kidneys are bean-shaped organs (about 11 cm x 7 cm x 3 cm) that are located against the back muscles in the upper abdominal area. They sit opposite each other on both the left and right side of the body; the right kidney, however, sits a little lower than the left to accommodate the size of the ''liver''.' "
What is the function of the kidneys?,"'The excess waste products and excess fluid are removed when the kidneys produce urine that is excreted from the body. Moreover, the kidneys play an important role in regulation of the body salt, potassium, and acid content.''The kidneys also produce hormones that stimulate the production of ''red blood cells'' that help regulate ''blood pressure'' and help control calcium and ''electrolyte'' metabolism in the body.' "
What are the first signs and symptoms that are associated with kidney pain?,"'Symptoms associated with kidney pain (also termed renal or flank pain) are discomfort (acute or chronic), aches, or sharp pain that occurs in the back between approximately the lowest rib and the buttock. Depending on the cause of the pain, it may radiate down the flank to the groin or toward the abdominal area. Some individuals may develop symptoms and signs such as:''Other symptoms and signs that may occur if the kidney function is increasingly compromised are a''Depending on the underlying cause, kidney pain may occur on the left or right side. Sometimes it can occur on both sides of the back; traumatic kidney injury (kidney laceration) may cause the above symptoms, but mild damage may initially have no symptoms. Severe kidney lacerations can cause abnormal blood pressure and pulse, and ''shock''.''Kidney pain itself is a symptom that may happen due to problems or diseases of the kidney or its associated structures, including the ureters or bladder. However, other diseases may mimic kidney pain, ''but are not actually due to the kidneys'', for example,''Although kidney pain often occurs on one side of the back, it can occur on both sides at the same time and may radiate toward the abdomen or groin.''Pain that occurs suddenly, is sharp, severe, and may increase and decrease in waves is often due ''kidney stones'' in the ureters of the kidneys. Pain caused by kidney stones is termed renal ''colic''.' Fever Painful urination (dysuria) Blood in the urine Nausea Vomiting Dizziness Constipation or diarrhea Rash Fatigue Chills metallic taste in the mouth, bad breath, swelling and shortness of breath. muscle strains in the back, spinal problems (fracture, abscesses), rib pain, pleuritis, radiculitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, shingles, aortic abdominal aneurysm, gynecological problems, and many other causes."
What are some examples of kidney conditions and diseases that cause pain?,"'Many of the causes of ''kidney disease'' that lead to kidney pain (also termed flank pain) are due to acquired underlying diseases that may acutely or chronically affect kidney function. Other diseases are present at birth. Some people may be born with an abnormality that is genetically determined that affects the kidneys.''Kidney pain or flank pain can be acute, relatively constant, and sharp. This is termed ""renal ''colic''."" This kind of pain is usually seen when a ''kidney stone'' or other problem blocks the tube (ureter) that drains the kidney. However, other processes can cause chronic dull aching with occasionally sharp kidney pain. Some of the causes of kidney pain or flank pain are as follows:'   Urinary tract infections (UTI) Bladder infection (cystitis) Kidney infections (pyelonephritis) Hydronephrosis Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis and/or ureterolithiasis) Kidney cancer Anything that compresses the kidney (for example, a large tumor) Glomerulonephritis Blood clots in the kidneys (renal vein thrombosis) Polycystic kidney disease (congenital) Congenital malformations in the renal system resulting in complete or partial blockage of urine flow Drugs or toxins that harm kidney tissue (for example, pesticide exposure or chronic use of medications such as ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin, and others]) Kidney pain during pregnancy Kidney bleeding (hemorrhage) such as from penetrating trauma or blunt trauma (""kidney laceration"") End-stage renal disease"
When should call a doctor for kidney pain?,"'Individuals should not postpone seeing a doctor about kidney pain or flank pain. Although flank pain is often seen in underlying problems with the kidney, there are many other diseases that can mimic kidney pain, and a physician can help with an accurate diagnosis of underlying problems that result in kidney or flank pain. Any acute onset of intense kidney or flank pain should be evaluated immediately.''Warning signs that ''kidney disease'' is present and may result in kidney pain or flank pain are the following:''In addition, if an individual has ''diabetes'' or any of the congenital problems that lead to kidney dysfunction, the individual should be routinely checked for the onset of kidney dysfunction or ''kidney failure'' by their physician.' Blood or protein in the urine More frequent urination, especially at night and/or difficult or painful urination High blood pressure Swelling of the hands and feet and/or puffiness around the eyes Testing that shows an abnormal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 (calculated as ml/min/meter2)"
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney diseases?,"'The doctor usually will do a history and physical examination. Initial tests usually consist of a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), kidney function (''creatinine'' and BUN), and urine test, and when appropriate, a ''pregnancy test''. A lacerated kidney may be suspected if the person has experienced a traumatic injury to the lower back.''If kidney stones are suspected, a CT exam (renal protocol or noncontrast spiral CT) or renal ''ultrasound'' is done; an abdominal X-ray (KUB) may be ordered but has been replaced in general by ''ultrasound'' and CT. As patients with kidney stones often need repeat X-ray studies or have repeat episodes of kidney stones, ultrasound with its lack of ''radiation'' is a good study to consider. Abdominal/pelvic CTs with contrast or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and aortogram may be ordered to further define or differentiate underlying kidney (renal) and nonrenal causes of flank pain. Such studies are routinely performed if a kidney is suspected to be damaged by a traumatic event (auto accident, gunshot ''wound'', or blunt trauma such as from a collision in football or workplace injury).' "
What is the treatment for kidney pain?,"   Kidney pain (flank pain) treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pain. Kidney infections and kidney stones that cause pain are often treated with ibuprofen, ketorolac (Toradol), acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), or occasionally with small amounts of morphine (kidney stones). However, these agents treat pain (pain relief only) and not the underlying cause(s) of pain. Some patients may spontaneously pass (urine sweeps the irritating kidney stone out of the ureters and/or urethra) small kidney stones (usually less than about 6 mm in diameter) and then be pain-free. Infections like urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pyelonephritis usually require antibiotic treatments in addition to pain medications. If kidney stones completely block a ureter or are about 6 mm in diameter or larger, they may require urologic surgery. Usually, recovery time is fast (same day or a few days) if kidney stones are removed by retrograde surgical techniques. However, some severe kidney lacerations may require more extensive surgery. Recovery time for these surgeries varies from weeks to months. Other underlying causes of flank pain may need similar pain management and concurrent treatments. However, patients with known kidney problems (kidney disease) and/or renal function compromise should not be treated with pain medications that are either filtered (removed) through the kidneys and/or may cause further renal damage."
What is knee pain?,"'Pain is a common knee problem that can originate in any of the bony structures compromising the ''knee joint'' (femur, tibia, fibula), the kneecap (''patella''), or the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage (''meniscus'') of the knee. Knee pain can be aggravated by physical activity, as well as ''obesity'', affected by the surrounding muscles and their movements, and be triggered by other problems (such as a foot injury). Knee pain can affect people of all ages, and home remedies can be helpful unless it becomes severe.' "
What are knee pain symptoms and signs?,"'The location of the knee pain can vary depending on which structure is involved. With infection or an inflammatory process, the whole knee might be swollen and painful, while a ''torn meniscus'' or ''fracture'' of a bone gives symptoms only in one specific location. A ''Baker cyst'' will usually cause pain in the back of the knee.''The severity of the ''joint pain'' can vary, from a minor ache to a severe and disabling pain.''Some of the other signs and symptoms that accompany knee pain are'   difficulty weight bearing or walking due to instability of the knee, limping due to discomfort, difficulty walking up or down steps due to ligament damage (sprain), locking of the knee (unable to bend the knee), redness and swelling, inability to extend the knee, and shifting weight to the opposite knee and foot."
What causes knee pain?,"'Knee pain can be divided into three major categories:''Below is a list of some of the more common causes of knee pain. This is not an all-inclusive list but rather highlights a few common causes of knee pain in each of the above categories.''Fractures'': A direct blow to the bony structure can cause one of the bones in the knee to break. This is usually a very obvious and painful ''knee injury''. Most knee fractures are not only painful but will also interfere with the proper functioning of the knee (such as kneecap fracture) or make it very painful to bear weight (such as tibial plateau fracture). All fractures need immediate medical attention. Many fractures require significant force, and a thorough examination is performed to detect other injuries.''Ligament injuries'': The most common injury is the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury. An ACL injury is often a sports-related injury due to a sudden stop and change in directions. The remaining ligaments (posterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, and medial collateral ligament) are injured less frequently.''Meniscus injuries'': The menisci (medial and lateral) are made of cartilage and act as ''shock'' absorbers between bones in the knee. Twisting the knee can injure the meniscus.''Dislocation'': The knee joint can be dislocated, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. ''Knee dislocation'' can compromise blood flow to the leg and have other related problems. This injury often occurs during a motor-vehicle accident when the knee hits the dashboard.'

   Acute injury: such as a broken bone, torn ligament, or meniscal tear Medical conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, infections Chronic use/overuse conditions: osteoarthritis, chondromalacia, IT band syndrome, patellar syndromes, tendinitis, and bursitis"
What medical conditions cause knee pain?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' is an autoimmune condition that can affect any joint in the body. It can cause severe pain and disability, as well as swelling.''Gout'' is a form of arthritis that is most commonly found in the big toe, though it can also affect the knee. ''Gout'' tends to flare up and is extremely painful during the acute episodes. When there is no flare-up, the knee can be pain free.''With ''septic arthritis'' (''infectious arthritis''), the knee joint can become infected; this leads to pain, swelling, and ''fever''. This condition requires antibiotics and drainage treatments as soon as possible.''Patellar tendinitis ''is an inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (the bone of the lower leg). Patellar tendinitis is a chronic condition often found in individuals repeating the same motion during ''exercise'' (such as runners and cyclists).''Patellofemoral pain syndrome is caused by degeneration or ''stress'' under the kneecap (patella) where it meets the thighbone (femur). Patellofemoral pain syndrome occurs in runners and cyclists.''Osteoarthritis'': a wearing down of cartilage of the joint due to use and age''Prepatellar bursitis'': Inflammation to the bursa (fluid-filled sac) in front of the kneecap may cause anterior knee pain.''Children can develop inflammation of the point of bony insertion of the patellar tendon (''Osgood-Schlatter disease'').' "
What are risk factors for knee pain?,"'Biomechanics'': The knee joint is complicated in its operation and is used frequently throughout the day. Any change in the movement of the joint (leg-length difference, change in walking style due to back problems) can cause subtle changes and cause pain and injuries.''Excess weight'': The ''stress'' on the knee joint is increased with excess weight. Obesity also increases the risk of knee\xa0osteoarthritis as the cartilage breaks down more rapidly.''Overuse during repetitive motions'' as are found during certain exercises (jogging, skiing) or work conditions (long periods of kneeling) can cause breakdown of cartilage and lead to pain.' "
When should see a doctor for knee pain?,"'Any pain that does not respond to rest or disappears within a few days should be evaluated by a doctor. In addition, the following are symptoms and signs in the knee that a doctor should evaluate: swelling, inability to bend, deformity, unable to walk or discomfort while walking, significant pain, and ''fever''.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose knee pain?,"""A health care professional will begin by asking questions related to the person's general health and then specifically to the nature of the knee pain (how long, how severe, does anything make it feel better or worse, etc.).""'Next, an examination of the knee will be performed. This will include bending the knee through the full range of motion, checking for stability of the ligaments, and evaluating for any tenderness and swelling. It is often helpful to compare the results of the examination of the painful knee with the other knee. Frequently, this is all that is required to make a diagnosis and start treatment. In several research studies, it has been found that an experienced examiner is as reliable as X-ray examination.''Sometimes the doctor might want to do further studies such as the following tests.''Plain X-ray can establish fractures and degenerative changes of the knee.''MRI'' is used to evaluate the soft tissues of the knee for ligament tears or cartilage and muscle injuries.''If ''gout'', arthritis, or other medical conditions are suspected, a health care professional might order blood tests.''Some conditions are best diagnosed by removal of a small amount of fluid from the knee joint. During ''arthrocentesis'', a small needle is placed into your joint and fluid is withdrawn. This is done in a sterile method. The fluid is then sent to the laboratory for evaluation. This procedure is especially helpful if an infected knee joint is suspected or to distinguish ''gout'' and different forms of arthritis. If there is a collection of blood in the joint due to a traumatic injury, removing the fluid can help relieve the pain.' "
Which types of doctors treat knee pain?,"'Often knee pain can be evaluated and treated by your primary care doctor. If the knee pain requires surgery or the cause of the pain needs further evaluation, an orthopedic surgeon will usually be consulted. With arthritis, ''gout'', or inflammatory joint problems a ''rheumatologist'' may be consulted.' "
What is the treatment for knee pain?,"'Treatments for knee pain are as varied as the conditions that can cause the pain.''Medications might be prescribed to treat an underlying medical condition or for pain relief.''If you are taking ''over-the-counter''\xa0anti-inflammatory pain medications regularly for your knee pain, you should see your doctor to be evaluated.''Sometimes physical therapy sessions to strengthen the muscles around the knee will make it more stable and help guarantee the best mechanical movements. Working with a physical therapist can help avoid injuries or further worsening of an injury.''Injecting medications directly into your knee might help in certain situations. The two most common injections are ''corticosteroids'' and lubricants. ''Corticosteroid'' injections can help arthritis and other inflammations of the knee. They usually need to be repeated every few months. Lubricants that are similar to the fluid already in your knee joint can help with movement and pain.'  "
Will surgery treat and cure knee pain?,"'Knee operations range from arthroscopic knee surgery to ''total knee replacement''. Arthroscopic knee surgery is a very common surgical procedure that allows the physician look inside your knee through a few small holes and a fiberoptic camera. The surgeon can repair many of the injuries and remove small pieces of loose bones or cartilage. This is a common outpatient procedure.''Partial ''knee replacement'': The surgeon replaces the damaged portions of the knee with ''plastic'' and metal parts. Because only part of the knee joint is replaced, this procedure has a shorter recovery then a total knee replacement.''Total knee replacement'': In this procedure, the knee is replaced with an artificial joint.''Acupuncture'' has shown some relieve of knee pain, especially in patients with osteoarthritis. ''Glucosamine'' and chondroitin ''supplements'' have shown mixed results in research studies.' "
What natural home remedies relieve knee pain?,"'Over-the-counter pain medications can frequently alleviate the pain. If someone is taking these medications on a regular basis, he or she should see a health care professional to evaluate the knee pain for proper diagnosis and to avoid the potential side effects of chronic medication use.''The RICE mnemonic is often helpful, especially for minor injuries:''Rest: Rest the joint, and take a break from your usually activities involving the knee joint.''Ice: Applying ice can help with pain and inflammation.''Compress: A compression bandage can help prevent swelling and help knee alignment. It should not be tight and should be removed at night.''Elevate: Elevation can help with swelling and resting of the knee.' "
What are the complications of knee pain?,"'Frequently, knee pain will disappear without ever finding a specific cause. Depending on the underlying cause of the pain, the condition can progress and lead to more serious injuries or complications. Usually, these complications are long term and result in worsening pain or an increasing difficulty to walk.' "
Can you prevent knee pain?,"'There can be many reasons for knee pain. Therefore, there are different strategies to prevent the pain depending on the underlying cause. ''Running'' on soft surfaces or decreasing the amount of running can help if the pain is due to overuse. Avoiding any direct injuries to the knee including wearing a seatbelt can prevent traumatic injuries. ''Weight loss'' can be helpful for many different forms of knee pain.' "
Can knee pain come back after being treated?,"'Frequently, knee pain will occur for a short period of time and then resolve. Sometimes it can return a few weeks or months later. For chronic knee pain, it is important to get it evaluated to avoid further damage to cartilage, bones, or ligaments. Prognosis depends on the underlying causes of the pain.'""With modern surgical techniques, it's possible to relieve many of the knee pain syndromes and return to an active lifestyle.""  "
What is the appendix? Do you need it?,"'The appendix is a closed-ended, narrow, worm-like tube up to several inches in length that attaches to the cecum (the first part of the colon). (The anatomical name for the appendix, vermiform appendix, means worm-like appendage.) The inner lining of the appendix produces a small amount of ''mucus'' that flows through the open central core of the appendix and into the cecum. The wall of the appendix contains lymphatic tissue that is part of the immune system. Like the rest of the colon, the wall of the appendix also contains a layer of muscle, but the layer of muscle is poorly developed.'""It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body in older children and adults. In young children, it may have an immune function. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease."" "
What is appendicitis? What causes it?,"'Appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to ''stool'' that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or ''stool'' hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a ""fecalith"" (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, it might be that the lymphatic tissue in the appendix swells and blocks the opening. After the blockage occurs, bacteria which normally are found within the appendix begin to multiply and invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. If the symptoms of appendicitis are not recognized and the inflammation progresses, the appendix can rupture, followed by spread of bacteria outside of the appendix. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue that lines the wall of the appendix, for example, inflammation that causes swelling and buildup of pressure within the appendix that causes it to rupture.''After rupture, infection can spread throughout the abdomen; however, it usually is confined to a small area surrounding the appendix by the surrounding tissues, forming a peri-''appendiceal'' abscess.''Sometimes, the body is successful in containing (""healing"") the appendicitis without surgical treatment if the infection and accompanying inflammation cause the appendix to rupture. The inflammation, ''pain'', and symptoms also may disappear when antibiotics are used. This is particularly true in elderly patients. Patients then may come to the doctor long after the episode of appendicitis with a lump or a mass in the right lower abdomen that is due to the scarring that occurs during healing. This lump might raise the suspicion of ''cancer''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of appendicitis? Is it painful?,"'Early signs and symptoms of appendicitis often are mild, consisting merely of a loss of appetite and/or nausea and a sense of not feeling well. There may not be even ''abdominal pain''.''Nevertheless, as the course of the appendicitis progresses the main symptom becomes abdominal ''pain''.''If not already present, a second symptom of appendicitis is loss of appetite, which may progress to nausea and even vomiting. Nausea and vomiting may occur later due to ''intestinal obstruction'' from the expanding inflammatory mass or abscess rather than from local inflammation.''As appendiceal inflammation increases, it may extend through the appendix to its outer covering and then to the lining of the abdomen, a thin membrane called the peritoneum. Once the peritoneum becomes inflamed, the character of the pain changes and then can be localized clearly to one small area. Generally, this area is between the front of the right hipbone and the ''belly button'"". The exact point is named after Dr. Charles McBurney-McBurney's point. If the appendix ruptures and infection spreads throughout the abdomen, the pain becomes diffuse again as the entire lining of the abdomen becomes inflamed.""   The pain is at first diffuse and poorly localized, that is, not confined to one spot. (Poorly localized pain is typical whenever a problem is confined to the small intestine or colon, including the appendix.) The pain is so difficult to pinpoint that when asked to point to the area of the pain, most people indicate the location of the pain with a circular motion of their hand around the central part of their abdomen. With time, the pain may localize to the right lower abdomen, and the patient may be able to identify an exact location of the pain."
What tests diagnose appendicitis?,"'The diagnosis of appendicitis begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Patients often have an elevated temperature, and there usually will be moderate to severe tenderness in the right lower abdomen when the doctor pushes there. If inflammation has spread to the peritoneum, there is frequently rebound tenderness. Rebound tenderness is pain that is worse when the doctor quickly releases his or her hand after gently pressing on the abdomen over the area of tenderness. It is due to the sudden rebound of the peritoneum after it has been deformed by finger pressure.''The white blood cell count usually becomes elevated with infection. In early appendicitis, before infection sets in, it can be normal, but most often there is at least a mild elevation even early in the process. Unfortunately, appendicitis is not the only condition that causes elevated white blood cell counts. Almost any infection or inflammation can cause the count to be abnormally high. Therefore, an elevated white blood cell count alone cannot be used to confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis.''Urinalysis is a microscopic examination of the urine that detects ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine. Urinalysis usually is abnormal when there is inflammation or stones in the kidneys or bladder. The urinalysis also may be abnormal with appendicitis because the appendix lies near the ureter and bladder. If the inflammation of appendicitis is great enough, it can spread to the ureter and bladder leading to an abnormal urinalysis. Most patients with appendicitis, however, have a normal urinalysis. Therefore, a normal urinalysis suggests appendicitis more than a urinary tract problem.' "
What happens if the appendix ruptures?,"'On occasion, a person may not see their doctor until appendicitis with rupture has been present for many days or even weeks. In this situation, an abscess usually has formed, and the ''appendiceal perforation'' may have closed over. If the abscess is small, it initially can be treated with antibiotics; however, an abscess usually requires drainage. A drain (a small ''plastic'' or rubber tube) usually is inserted through the skin and into the abscess with the aid of an ''ultrasound'' or ''CT scan'' that can determine the exact location of the abscess. The drain allows pus to flow from the abscess out of the body. The appendix may be removed several weeks or months after the abscess has resolved. This is called an interval appendectomy and is done to prevent a second attack of appendicitis.' "
What is the treatment for appendicitis? Is surgery necessary?,"'Once a diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy), usually is performed. Antibiotics usually are begun prior to surgery and as soon as appendicitis is suspected. More recently it has been suggested that with milder degrees of inflammation and no complications that antibiotics alone are adequate.''There is a small group of patients in whom the inflammation and infection of appendicitis remain mild and localized to a small area. The body is able not only to contain the inflammation and infection but to resolve them as well. These patients usually are not very ill and improve during several days of observation. This type of appendicitis is referred to as ""confined appendicitis"" and may be treated with antibiotics alone. The appendix may or may not be removed later. There is still some controversy, however, about leaving the healed appendix in place since appendicitis can recur.''On occasion, a person may not see their doctor until appendicitis with rupture has been present for many days or even weeks. In this situation, an abscess usually has formed, and the appendiceal perforation may have closed over. If the abscess is small, it initially can be treated with antibiotics; however, an abscess usually requires drainage. A drain (a small plastic or rubber tube) usually is inserted through the skin and into the abscess with the aid of an ultrasound or CT scan that can determine the exact location of the abscess. The drain allows the pus to flow from the abscess out of the body. The appendix may be removed several weeks or months after the abscess has resolved. This is called an interval appendectomy and is done to prevent a second attack of appendicitis.'  "
What is an appendectomy (surgery)?,"'New techniques for removing the appendix involve the use of the laparoscope. The laparoscope is a thin telescope attached to a video camera that allows the surgeon to inspect the inside of the abdomen through a small puncture wound (instead of a larger incision). If appendicitis is found, the appendix can be removed with special instruments that can be passed into the abdomen, just like the laparoscope, through small ''puncture wounds''. The benefits of the laparoscopic technique include less post-operative pain (since much of the post-surgery pain comes from the incisions) and a speedier return to normal activities. An additional advantage of laparoscopy is that it allows the surgeon to look inside the abdomen to make a clear diagnosis in cases in which the diagnosis of appendicitis is in doubt. For example, laparoscopy is especially helpful for menstruating women in whom a rupture of an ''ovarian cyst'' may mimic appendicitis.''If the appendix is not ruptured (perforated) at the time of surgery, the patient generally is sent home from the hospital after surgery in one or two days. Patients whose appendix has perforated are sicker than patients without perforation, and their hospital stay often is prolonged (four to seven days), particularly if peritonitis has occurred. Intravenous antibiotics are given in the hospital to fight infection and assist in resolving any abscess.''Occasionally, the surgeon may find a normal-appearing appendix and no other cause for the patient\'s problem. In this situation, the surgeon will usually remove the appendix. The reasoning in these cases is that it is better to remove a normal-appearing appendix than to miss, and not treat appropriately, an early or mild case of appendicitis. In addition, if patients have ""appendicitis"" like pain again, the doctor will know that the appendix has been removed, and the diagnosis of appendicitis is not possible.'   During an appendectomy, an incision two to three inches in length is made through the skin and the layers of the abdominal wall over the area of the appendix. The surgeon enters the abdomen and looks for the appendix, which usually is in the right lower abdomen. After examining the area around the appendix to be certain that no additional problem is present, the appendix is removed. This is done by freeing the appendix from its mesenteric attachment to the colon, cutting the appendix from the colon, and sewing over the hole in the colon. If an abscess is present, the pus can be drained with drains that pass from the abscess and out through the skin. The abdominal incision then is closed."
What is the recovery time for an appendectomy (surgery)?,"'Recovery from an appendectomy depends on the severity of the inflammation. If inflammation is mild, recovery can take a few days to a week.\xa0 If there has been more extensive inflammation such as an abscess or localized perforation of the appendix, recovery might take several weeks.\xa0 Free rupture of the appendix into the peritoneal ''cavity'' (abdomen) may require even longer.\xa0 Recovery has become much faster with the substitution of laparoscopic for “open” surgery.' "
What is confined appendicitis?,"'There is a small group of patients in whom the inflammation and infection of appendicitis remain mild and localized to a small area. The body is able not only to contain the inflammation and infection but to resolve them as well. These patients usually are not very ill and improve during several days of observation. This type of appendicitis is referred to as ""confined appendicitis"" and may be treated with antibiotics alone. The appendix may or may not be removed later. There is still some controversy, however, about leaving the healed appendix in place since appendicitis can recur.' "
"What is ""stump appendicitis?""","'When the appendix is removed surgically, a small portion may be left behind. This piece of appendix may become inflamed and is prone to develop all of the complications of appendicitis. Thus, it is possible for individuals who have had their appendix ""removed"" to develop another episode of appendicitis. Stump appendicitis is treated similarly to appendicitis with an intact (surgically unremoved) appendix. It is important to consider early and diagnose stump appendicitis since inadequate diagnosis and treatment can result in a rupture of the inflamed stump.' "
What procedures diagnose appendicitis?,"'An abdominal x-ray may detect the fecalith (the hardened and calcified, pea-sized piece of stool that blocks the appendiceal opening) that may be the cause of appendicitis. This is especially true in children. Nevertheless, the presence of a fecalith can occur without appendicitis.''An ultrasound is a painless procedure that uses sound waves to provide images to identify organs within the body. Ultrasound can identify an enlarged appendix or an abscess. Nevertheless, during appendicitis, an enlarged inflamed appendix or abscess can be seen in only 50% of patients. Therefore, not seeing the appendix during an ultrasound does not exclude appendicitis. Ultrasound also is helpful in women because it can exclude the presence of conditions involving the ovaries, Fallopian tubes and uterus (''pelvic inflammatory disease'', PID) that can mimic appendicitis.'""A barium enema is an X-ray test in which liquid barium is inserted into the colon from the anus to fill the colon. This test can, at times, show an impression on the colon in the area of the appendix where the inflammation from the adjacent inflammation impinges on the colon. Barium enema also can exclude other intestinal problems that mimic appendicitis, for example Crohn's disease.""'In patients who are not ''pregnant'', a CT scan (a type of X-ray study) of the area of the appendix is useful in diagnosing appendicitis and peri-appendiceal abscesses as well as in excluding other diseases inside the abdomen and pelvis that can mimic appendicitis.''Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure in which a small fiberoptic tube with a camera is inserted into the abdomen through a small puncture made on the abdominal wall. Laparoscopy allows a direct view of the appendix as well as other abdominal and pelvic organs. If appendicitis is found, the inflamed appendix can be removed with the laparoscope. The disadvantage of laparoscopy compared to ultrasound and CT is that it requires a general anesthetic.''Currently, there is no test for appendicitis that will definitively diagnose the infection. Therefore, the approach to suspected appendicitis may include a period of observation, tests as previously mentioned, or surgery.' "
Why is it difficult to diagnose appendicitis?,"'It can be difficult to diagnose appendicitis. The position of the appendix in the abdomen may vary. Most of the time the appendix is in the right lower abdomen, but the appendix, like other parts of the intestine, has a mesentery. This mesentery is a sheet-like membrane that attaches the appendix to other structures within the abdomen. If the mesentery is large, the appendix to move around. In addition, the appendix may be longer than normal. The combination of a large mesentery and a long appendix allows the appendix to dip down into the pelvis (among the pelvic organs in women). It also may allow the appendix to move behind the colon (called a retro-''colic'"" appendix). In either case, inflammation of the appendix may appear to be more like the inflammation of other organs, for example, of a woman's pelvic organs.""'The diagnosis of appendicitis also can be difficult because other inflammatory problems may mimic appendicitis, for example, right side ''diverticulitis''. Therefore, it is common to observe patients with suspected appendicitis for a period to see if the problem will resolve on its own or develop characteristics that more strongly suggest appendicitis or, perhaps, another condition.' "
What are the complications of appendicitis? Can they be life-threatening?,"'The most frequent complication of appendicitis is perforation. Perforation of the appendix can lead to a peri-appendiceal abscess (a collection of infected pus) or diffuse peritonitis (infection of the entire lining of the abdomen and the pelvis). The major reason for appendiceal perforation is delay in diagnosis and treatment. In general, the longer the delay between diagnosis and surgery, the more likely is perforation. The risk of perforation 36 hours after the onset of symptoms is at least 15%. Therefore, once appendicitis is diagnosed, surgery should be done without unnecessary delay if the patient does not improve with antibiotics alone.''A less common complication of appendicitis is blockage or obstruction of the intestine. Blockage occurs when the inflammation surrounding the appendix compresses the intestine, and this prevents the intestinal contents from passing. If the intestine above the blockage begins to fill with liquid and ''gas'', the abdomen distends, and greater nausea and vomiting may occur. It then may be necessary to drain the contents of the intestine through a tube passed through the nose and ''esophagus'' and into the stomach and intestine.''A feared complication of appendicitis is ''sepsis'', a condition in which infecting bacteria enter the blood and travel to other parts of the body. This is a very serious, even life-threatening complication. Fortunately, it occurs infrequently.'  "
Which specialties of doctors treat appendicitis?,"'A person with appendicitis may be seen first by family practitioners, internists, and pediatricians. However, usually the person is evaluated by a general or another type of surgeon. Once appendicitis is suspected, a general surgeon always is consulted in case surgery is necessary.' "
What other conditions can mimic appendicitis?,"'The surgeon faced with a patient suspected of having appendicitis always must consider and look for other conditions that can mimic appendicitis. Among the conditions that mimic appendicitis are:' Meckel's diverticulitis. A Meckel's diverticulum is a small outpouching of the small intestine, which usually is located in the right lower abdomen near the appendix. The diverticulum may become inflamed or even perforate (break open or rupture). If inflamed and/or perforated, it usually is removed surgically. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The right Fallopian tube and ovary lie near the appendix. Sexually active women may contract infectious diseases that involve the tube and ovary. Usually, antibiotic therapy is sufficient treatment, and surgical removal of the tube and ovary are not necessary. Inflammatory diseases of the right upper abdomen. Fluids from the right upper abdomen may drain into the lower abdomen where they stimulate inflammation and mimic appendicitis. Such fluids may come from a perforated duodenal ulcer, gallbladder disease, or inflammatory diseases of the liver, for example, a liver abscess. Right-sided diverticulitis. Although most diverticuli are located on the left side of the colon, they occasionally occur on the right side. When a right-sided diverticulum ruptures, it can provoke inflammation that mimics appendicitis. Kidney diseases. The right kidney is close enough to the appendix that inflammatory problems in the kidney-for example, an abscess-can mimic appendicitis. Ectopic pregnancy: Although it usually is easy to differentiate between a normal intrauterine pregnancy, if the fetus implants in the fallopian tube or elsewhere instead of the uterus, the symptoms may mimic appendicitis."
What are the complications of appendectomy?,"'The most common complication of appendectomy is an infection of the wound, that is, of the surgical incision. Such infections vary in severity from mild, with only redness and perhaps some tenderness over the incision, to moderate, requiring only antibiotics, to severe, requiring antibiotics and surgical treatment. Occasionally, the inflammation and infection of appendicitis are so severe that the surgeon will not close the incision at the end of the surgery because of concern that the wound is already infected. Instead, the skin closing is postponed for several days to allow the infection to subside with antibiotic therapy and make it less likely for infection to occur within the incision. Wound infections are less common with laparoscopic surgery.''Another complication of appendectomy is an abscess, a collection of pus in the area of the appendix or pelvis. Although abscesses can be drained of their pus surgically, there are also non-surgical techniques, as previously discussed.'""It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body in older children and adults. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease."" "
What is new about appendicitis?,"'Recently, it has been hypothesized that some episodes of appendicitis-like symptoms, especially recurrent symptoms, may be due to an increased sensitivity of the intestine and appendix from a prior episode of inflammation. That is, the recurrent symptoms are not due to recurrent episodes of inflammation. Rather, prior inflammation has made the nerves of the ''intestines'' and appendix or the central nervous system that innervate them more sensitive to normal stimuli, that is, with stimuli other than inflammation. This will be a difficult, if not impossible, hypothesis to confirm.' "
Introduction to pain management,"'Pain'' management can be simple or complex, depending on the cause of the pain. An example of pain that is typically less complex would be nerve root irritation from a ''herniated disc'' with pain radiating down the leg. This condition can often be alleviated with an ''epidural steroid injection'' and physical therapy. Sometimes, however, the pain does not go away. This can require a wide variety of skills and techniques to treat the pain. These skills and techniques include: '""All of these skills and services are necessary because pain can involve many aspects of a person's daily life. "" Interventional procedures Medication management  Physical therapy or chiropractic therapy Psychological counseling and support  Acupuncture and other alternative therapies; and 
 Referral to other medical specialists "
How is pain treatment guided?,"'The treatment of pain is guided by the history of the pain, its intensity, duration, aggravating and relieving conditions, and structures involved in causing the pain. In order for a structure to cause pain, it must have a nerve supply, be susceptible to injury, and stimulation of the structure should cause pain. The concept behind most interventional procedures for treating pain is that there is a specific structure in the body with nerves of sensation that is generating the pain. Pain management has a role in identifying the precise source of the problem and isolating the optimal treatment. ''Fluoroscopy is an X-ray guided viewing method. Fluoroscopy is often used to assist the doctor in precisely locating the injection so that the medication reaches the appropriate spot and only the appropriate spot. ''Ultrasound'' is also used to identify structures and guide injections.'  "
What are the basic types of pain?,"'There are many sources of pain. One way of dividing these sources of pain is to divide them into two groups, nociceptive pain and ''neuropathic pain''. How pain is treated depends in large part upon what type of pain it is.''Examples of nociceptive pain are a cut or a ''broken bone''. Tissue damage or injury initiates signals that are transferred through peripheral nerves to the brain via the spinal cord. Pain signals are modulated throughout the pathways. This is how we become aware that something is hurting.''Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage or disease that affects the nervous system. Sometimes there is no obvious source of pain, and this pain can occur spontaneously. Classic examples of this pain are ''shingles'' and ''diabetic peripheral neuropathy''. It is pain that can occur after nerves are cut or after a ''stroke''.' "
Nociceptive pain,"'Most back, leg, and ''arm pain'' is nociceptive pain. Nociceptive pain can be divided into two parts, radicular or somatic. ''Radicular pain: ''Radicular pain is pain that stems from irritation of the nerve roots, for example, from a ''disc herniation''. It goes down the leg or arm in the distribution of the nerve that exits from the nerve root at the spinal cord. Associated with radicular pain is ''radiculopathy'', which is ''weakness'', numbness, tingling or loss of reflexes in the distribution of the nerve.''Somatic pain:'' Somatic pain is pain limited to the back or thighs. The problem that doctors and patients face with ''back pain'', is that after a patient goes to the doctor and has an appropriate history taken, a physical exam performed, and appropriate imaging studies (for example, ''X-rays'', ''MRIs'' or ''CT scans''), the doctor can only make an exact diagnosis a minority of the time. The cause of most ''back pain'' is not identified and is classifies as idiopathic. Three structures in the back which frequently cause ''back pain'' are the facet joints, the discs, and the sacroiliac joint. The facet joints are small joints in the back of the spine that provide stability and limit how far you can bend back or twist. The discs are the ""''shock'' absorbers"" that are located between each of the bony building blocks (vertebrae) of the spine. The sacroiliac joint is a joint at the buttock area that serves in normal ''walking'' and helps to transfer weight from the upper body onto the legs.''Fluoroscopically (x-ray) guided injections can help to determine from where pain is coming. Once the pain has been accurately diagnosed, it can be optimally treated. '  "
Neuropathic pain,"'Neuropathic pain includes:''The various neuropathic pains can be difficult to treat. However, with careful diagnosis and often a combination of methods of treatments, there is an excellent chance of improving the pain and return of function. ''Medications are a mainstay of treatment of neuropathic pain.  In general, they work by influencing how pain information is handled by the body.  Most pain information is filtered out by the central nervous system, usually at the level of the spinal cord.  For example, if you are sitting in a chair, your peripheral nerves send the response to the pressure between your body and the chair to your nervous system.  However, because that information serves no usual purpose, it is filtered out in the spinal cord.  Many medications to treat neuropathic pain operate on this filtering process.  The types of medications used for neuropathic pain include ''antidepressants'', which influence the amount of serotonin or norepinephrine, and antiseizure medications, which act on various neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine.''One of the most powerful tools in treating neuropathic pain is the spinal cord stimulator, which delivers tiny amounts of electrical energy directly onto the spine. Stimulation works by interrupting inappropriate pain information being sent up to the brain. It also creates a tingling in the pain extremity, which masks pain.'   Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy;  Sympathetically maintained pain; Fibromyalgia;  Interstitial cystitis; and  Irritable bowel syndrome. "
What are other causes of pain?,"'Other causes of pain include:''Headaches'' are a major source of discomfort and lost productivity in the workplace. Many effective treatments exist for persisting ''headaches'', including medication, biofeedback, injections and implants, depending upon the precise type of ''headache''. ''Botox'' also provides a useful means of effectively and safely treating ''headaches''.''Atypical facial pain can be debilitating. Often times it can be treated by injections into local nerve tissue (such as the sphenopalatine ''ganglion'').''Trigeminal neuralgia'', also called tic douloureux, is a condition that most commonly causes very intense intermittent shooting pain in the face. ''Peripheral nerve pain, or neuropathy, can be debilitating. It can respond well to simple treatments such a trigger point injections with anesthetic medicines and cryoablation (an office based procedure which involves freezing the nerves). Examples of peripheral nerve pain include intercostal neuralgia, ilioinguinal neuroma, hypogastric neuroma, lateral femoral cutaneous ''nerve entrapment'', interdigital neuroma and related nerve entrapments. ''Coccydynia'' is simply pain in the region on the tailbone, or ''coccyx''. It can result from ''trauma'' or arise without apparent cause. The initial treatment is conservative, with oral pain relief medicines (analgesics). Oftentimes, the pain originates in the portion of the nervous system that we have no control of (involuntary or autonomic nervous system) and can respond to either a local anesthetic injection of the head of a nerve called ''Ganglion'' Impar, which is located below the coccyx or by medically destroying (ablating) the Ganglion Impar, usually using radiofrequency.''Compression fractures of the bony building blocks (vertebral bodies) are common in the elderly as a result of ''osteoporosis'', or loss of calcium in the bone. With less calcium, the bone becomes weak and can break. Like any ''fracture'', compression fractures hurt. Like any fracture, they are treated by stabilization, in this case, by injecting cement into the bone in a procedure known as a vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Vertebroplasty is an effective way to treat the pain of compression fractures. Kyphoplasty uses a balloon to restore height to the compressed vertebral body.''Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful condition occurring after a bout of ''shingles''. When we are young, we are almost all exposed to ''chickenpox'', caused by the ''Herpes Zoster'' virus. Our immune system controls the virus, but it lives in a dormant state in the spinal cord. When we age, or become ill or stressed, the virus can reactivate and attack the infected nerve and adjacent skin. However, in this second attack, the body usually recognizes the ''Herpes'' Zoster'' virus and contains the pain to a localized area, along the course of one nerve. A patient may have the characteristic ''blisters'', which normally heal. Sometimes, however, the ''Herpes Zoster'' virus damages the nerve, causing ongoing nerve pain that persists after the skin blisters from the ''shingles'' have healed. ''The ideal way to treat the post herpetic neuralgia is to treat it before it sets in. Medications, such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), steroids and injections such as sympathetic injections can help prevent the onset of PHN. After the pain is present, injections, local anesthetics, medications [''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''amitriptyline'', (''Elavil'', ''Endep'')] and pain medications or topical patches can be useful.''Myofasciitis (pain in the muscles, whether in the neck or back) often responds to conservative physical therapy treatments (for example, ''massage'' and ''exercise''). If the pain persists, trigger point injections can be used. If the trigger point injections provide temporary relief, sometimes ''Botox injections'' can help. Botox, which is ''botulinum ''toxin, can relax the muscles for six or more months, with long-term relief of pain. It provides a safe, effective treatment for what can otherwise be a difficult, ongoing problem.''Torticollis is spasm of the muscles in the neck, forcing the sufferer to hold his or her neck tilted or rotated to the side. Botox is approved for treatment of this problem. ''The ''piriformis muscle'' goes from the hip to ''sacrum'' (tailbone). It is important in that the ''sciatic nerve'' passes through it. Piriformis syndrome is a spasm of the piriformis muscle. When the muscle goes into spasm, it can squeeze the sciatic nerve, causing pain going down the leg. Piriformis syndrome will usually respond to physical therapy. When pain persists, local anesthetic and/or steroid injection can help. If the pain persists, injecting Botox or Myobloc, which are both ''botulinum'' toxins, into the muscle can provide effective, safe treatment.''Plantar fasciitis (''heel pain'') and ''lateral epicondylitis'' (''tennis elbow'') are two common pain problems. Treatment starts with conservative options, such as rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, steroid injections, over-the counter pain medications, physical therapy and, for ''heel pain'', shoe inserts. ''If the pain lasts for more than six months, Extracorporeal Shockwave Treatment is an effective, FDA approved treatment. Extracorporeal shockwave treatment is not recommended for ''pregnant'' women, children, anyone with a ''pacemaker'', anyone on anti-coagulant therapy or anyone with a history of bleeding problems.''Cancer'' pain  can arise from many different causes, including the ''cancer'' itself, compression of a nerve or other body part, fractures or treatment of the ''cancer''. There are many techniques to assist with treating the various pains from cancer, including medications and injections. In particular, medical destruction of nerve tissue (ablative therapies) and the use of pumps surgically placed into the body to deliver pain medication into the subarachnoid space can be used. Pain pumps deliver medication that is targeted to pain receptors on the spinal cord. The advantage to the cancer patient is ''chronic pain'' control with decreased side effects. '   headaches, facial pain,  peripheral nerve pain,  coccydynia,  compression fractures,  post-herpetic neuralgia, myofasciitis,  torticollis,  piriformis syndrome, plantar fasciitis,  lateral epicondylitis, and cancer pain ."
What Causes Musculoskeletal Pain?,"'The causes of musculoskeletal ''pain'' are varied. Muscle tissue can be damaged with the wear and tear of daily activities. ''Trauma'' to an area (jerking movements, auto accidents, falls, ''fractures'', ''sprains'', dislocations, and direct blows to the muscle) also can cause musculoskeletal ''pain''. Other causes of pain include postural strain, repetitive movements, overuse, and prolonged immobilization. Changes in posture or poor body mechanics may bring about spinal alignment problems and muscle shortening, therefore causing other muscles to be misused and become painful.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain?,"'People with musculoskeletal pain sometimes complain that their entire bodies ache. Their muscles may feel like they have been pulled or overworked. Sometimes the muscles twitch or ''burn''. Symptoms vary from person to person, but the common symptoms are:' Pain Fatigue Sleep disturbances Your doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination and medical history. In addition, your doctor may perform diagnostic studies to confirm the diagnosis."
How Is Musculoskeletal Pain Diagnosed?,"'Your doctor will conduct a thorough physical examination and medical history. In addition, your doctor may perform diagnostic studies to confirm the diagnosis.' "
How Is Musculoskeletal Pain Treated?,"'Different types of manual therapy, or mobilization, can be used to treat people with spinal alignment problems. For acute musculoskeletal pain, these techniques have been shown to speed recovery.''In patients with musculoskeletal disorders such as ''fibromyalgia'"", medications to increase the body's level of serotonin and norepinephrine (neurotransmitters that modulate ""'sleep'', pain, and immune system function) are prescribed in low doses. Some of the medicines used to aid sleep include ''Ambien'', ''Klonopin'', and ''Desyrel''.''Other treatments may include:''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic '""Women's Health""' Center' Injections with anesthetic or anti-inflammatory medications in or around the painful sites Exercise that includes muscle strengthening and stretching Physical or occupational therapy Acupuncture or acupressure Relaxation/biofeedback techniques Osteopathic manipulation (a whole system of evaluation and treatment designed to achieve and maintain health by restoring normal function to the body) Chiropractic care Therapeutic massage"
Introduction,"'Neuropathic pain'' is a complex, ''chronic pain'' state that usually is accompanied by tissue injury. With neuropathic ''pain'', the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other ''pain'' centers. The impact of nerve ''fiber'' injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.''One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain.' "
What causes neuropathic pain?,"'Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause; but, some common causes of neuropathic pain include:' Alcoholism Amputation Back, leg, and hip problems Chemotherapy Diabetes Facial nerve problems HIV infection or AIDS Multiple sclerosis Shingles Spine surgery"
What are the symptoms of neuropathic pain?,'Symptoms may include:' Shooting and burning pain Tingling and numbness
How is neuropathic pain diagnosed?,"'A doctor will conduct an interview and physical exam. He or she may ask questions about how you would describe your pain, when the pain occurs, or whether anything specific triggers the pain.' "
How is neuropathic pain treated?,"'Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', such as ''Aleve'' or ''Motrin'', may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller, such as those containing morphine. Anticonvulsant and ''antidepressant'' drugs seem to work in some cases.''If another condition, such as ''diabetes'', is involved, better management of that disorder may alleviate the pain.''In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use invasive or implantable device therapies to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in neuropathic pain generation may significantly control the pain symptoms.''Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious disability.' "
What is neuropathic pain?,"'When the sensory system is impacted by injury or disease, the nerves within that system cannot work to transmit sensation to the brain. This often leads to a sense of numbness, or lack of sensation. However, in some cases when this system is injured, individuals experience ''pain'' in the affected region. Neuropathic ''pain'' does not start abruptly or resolve quickly; it is a chronic condition which leads to persistent pain symptoms. For many patients, the intensity of their symptoms can wax and wane throughout the day. Although neuropathic pain is thought to be associated with peripheral nerve problems, such as neuropathy caused by ''diabetes'' or spinal stenosis, injuries to the brain or spinal cord can also lead to chronic neuropathic pain.''Neuropathic pain can be contrasted to nociceptive pain, which is the type of pain which occurs when someone experiences an acute injury, such as smashing a finger with a hammer or stubbing a toe when ''walking'' barefoot. This type of pain is typically short-lived and usually quite responsive to common pain medications in contrast to neuropathic pain.' "
What are the risk factors for neuropathic pain?,"'Anything that leads to loss of function within the sensory nervous system can cause neuropathic pain. As such, nerve problems from ''carpal tunnel syndrome'' or similar conditions can trigger neuropathic pain. ''Trauma'', causing nerve injury, can lead to neuropathic pain. Other conditions which can predispose patients to developing neuropathic pain include ''diabetes'', vitamin deficiencies, ''cancer'', ''HIV'', ''stroke'', ''multiple sclerosis'', ''shingles'', and ''cancer'' treatments.' "
What causes neuropathic pain?,"'There are many reasons that patients may develop neuropathic pain. However, on a cellular level, one explanation is that an increased release of certain neurotransmitters which signal pain, combined with an impaired ability of the nerves to regulate these signals leads to the sensation of pain originating from the affected region. Additionally, in the spinal cord, the area which interprets painful signals is rearranged, with corresponding changes in neurotransmitters and loss of normally-functioning cell bodies; these alterations result in the perception of pain even in the absence of external stimulation. In the brain, the ability to block pain can be lost following an injury such as ''stroke'' or trauma. Over time, further cellular damage occurs and the sense of pain persists.''Neuropathic pain is associated with ''diabetes'', chronic ''alcohol'' intake, certain ''cancers'', vitamin B deficiency, infections, other nerve-related diseases, toxins, and certain ''drugs''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain?,"'Unlike other neurological conditions, identification of neuropathic pain is hard. Few, if any, objective signs are present. Examiners have to decipher and interpret a collection of words that patients use to describe their pain. Patients may describe their symptoms as sharp, dull, hot, ''cold'', sensitive, ''itchy'', deep, stinging, burning, or some other descriptor. Additionally, some patients may feel pain with a light touch or pressure.''In an effort to help identify how much pain patients may be experiencing, different scales are often used. Patients are asked to rate their pain based on a visual scale or numeric graph. Many examples of pain scales exist. Often, pictures of faces depicting various degrees of pain can be helpful when patients have a difficult time describing the amount of pain they are experiencing.'  "
How is neuropathic pain diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of pain is based upon further assessment of a patient's history. If underlying nerve damage is suspected, then evaluation of the nerves with testing may be warranted. The most common way to evaluate whether a nerve is injured is with electrodiagnostic medicine. This medical subspecialty uses techniques of a nerve conduction studies with electromyelography (NCS/""'EMG''). Clinical evaluation may reveal some evidence of loss of function, and can include assessment of light touch, the ability to distinguish sharp from dull, the ability to discern temperature, and assessment of vibration. Once a thorough clinical examination is performed, the electrodiagnostic study can be planned. These studies are performed by specially trained ''neurologist'' and physiatrists.''If neuropathy is suspected, a search for reversible causes should be done. This can include blood work for vitamin deficiencies or thyroid abnormalities, and imaging studies to exclude a structural lesion impacting the spinal cord. Depending on the results of this testing, there may be a way to decrease the severity of the neuropathy and potentially decrease the pain that a patient is experiencing. Unfortunately, in many conditions, even good control of the underlying cause of the neuropathy cannot reverse the neuropathy. This is commonly seen in patients with ''diabetic neuropathy''.''In rare instances, there may be evidence of changes in the skin and hair growth pattern in an affected area. These alterations may be associated with changes in ''sweating'' or ''perspiration'' as well. When present, these changes can help identify the probable presence of neuropathic pain associated with a condition called ''complex regional pain syndrome''.' "
What is the treatment for neuropathic pain?,"'Various medications have been used in an attempt to treat neuropathic pain. The majority of these medications are used off-label, meaning that the medication was approved by the FDA to treat other conditions and was then identified as being beneficial to treat neuropathic pain. ''Tricyclic antidepressants'' (''amitriptyline'', ''nortriptyline'', ''desipramine'') have been prescribed for control of neuropathic pain for many years. Some patients find that these can be quite effective in giving them relief. Other types of ''antidepressants'' have also been shown to provide some relief. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs like ''paroxetine'' and ''citalopram'') and other antidepressants (''venlafaxine'', ''bupropion'') have been used in some patients.''Another common treatment of neuropathic pain includes antiseizure medications (''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'', ''gabapentin'', ''lamotrigine'"", and others). In severe cases of painful neuropathy which don't respond to first-line agents, medications typically used to treat ""'heart'' arrhythmias may be of some benefit; however, these can lead to significant side effects and must be monitored closely. Medications applied directly to the skin can provide modest to pronounced benefit for some patients. The forms commonly used include ''lidocaine'' (in patch or gel form) or capsaicin. Multiple arguments have been made both promoting and vilifying the use of narcotic agents to treat chronic neuropathic pain. No specific recommendations regarding the use of narcotics will be made at this time.''Curing neuropathic pain is dependent on the underlying cause. If the cause is reversible, then the peripheral nerves may regenerate and the pain will abate; however, this reduction in pain may take many months to years.'  "
What is the prognosis for neuropathic pain?,"'Many patients with neuropathic pain are able to find some measure of relief, even if their pain persists. Although neuropathic pain is not dangerous to a patient, the presence of ''chronic pain'' can negatively impact quality of life. Patients with chronic ''nerve pain'' may suffer from ''sleep'' deprivation or mood disorders, including ''depression'' and ''anxiety''. Because of the underlying neuropathy and lack of sensory feedback, patients are at risk of developing injury or infection or unknowingly causing an escalation of an existing injury.' "
Can neuropathic pain be prevented?,"'The best way to prevent neuropathic pain is to avoid development of neuropathy. Monitoring and modifying lifestyle choices, including limiting the use of tobacco and alcohol; maintaining a healthy weight to decrease the risk of diabetes, ''degenerative joint disease'', or ''stroke''; and using good ergonomic form at work or when practicing hobbies to decrease the risk of repetitive ''stress'' injury are ways to decrease the risk of developing neuropathy and possible neuropathic pain.' "
What are the testicles? What do they look like (pictures)?,"'The testicles form part of the male reproductive organs, with a primary function of producing sperm and the male hormone testosterone.' Testicles are contained within an external sac-like structure called the scrotum, which is located between the penis and the anus. Adult testicles are about the size two large olives. It is common for one testicle to hang lower than the other within the scrotum. Located near the back of each testicle lies the epididymis, which is a coiled tubular structure that functions to store and transport sperm. A tubular structure containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels and the vas deferens called the spermatic cord courses from the abdomen and is connected to each testicle. Apart from containing vital structures for each testicle, the spermatic cord also suspends the testicles within the scrotum."
What does testicular pain feel like? How severe is the pain?,"'Testicular pain is pain or discomfort that is felt in one or both testicles. The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.' "
What causes testicular pain? What are other symptoms of pain in the testicles?,"'Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. ''Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. '  "
"Testicular torsion causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the ""bell clapper"" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.''Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 to 18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the ''neonatal'' period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.''Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that is only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Elevation of the affected testicle within the scrotum Horizontal positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum Loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side (normally, the testicle elevates with light stroking of the upper inner thigh area)."
"Epididymitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Epididymitis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum). Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.''Sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'' that are most commonly caused by the bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are the most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria such as ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') that are found in the urinary tract. Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.''Epididymitis comes on gradually. The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and only in one testicle. Epididymitis also may have symptoms and signs including:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, typically localized to the area of the epididymis, though it can become more generalized and involve the whole testicle as the illness progresses Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Urethral discharge Urinary symptoms, such as burning, urgency, or frequency"
"Inguinal hernia causes, symptoms, and signs","'An ''inguinal hernia'' is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause ''swelling of the scrotum'' and subsequent testicular pain.''Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal ''hernia'' may include a:' Bulge in the scrotum or in the inguinal area, that may become more pronounced with coughing or straining; and Dull ache or burning sensation in the scrotum and/or testicles."
"Testicular tumor causes, symptoms, and signs","""Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:"" Lump or mass of the testicle Change in the size or texture of the testicle Dull ache of the lower abdomen, lower back or groin area Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum"
"Orchitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached ''puberty''; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescent males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps ''vaccine''. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).''Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or redness Fever and chills Headache Body aches Nausea Fatigue Parotid gland inflammation (parotitis) in cases of mumps"
"Trauma and injury causes, symptoms, and signs","'Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.''The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.''Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or bruising Bruising of the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) Nausea and vomiting"
"Testicle rupture causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicle rupture is a serious injury that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.''Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.' "
"Torsion of a testicular appendage cause, symptoms, and signs","'Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.''With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.''The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:''Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.' Testicular tenderness, typically only localized to the top of the right or left testicle. Sometimes, a small blue-dot is visualized near the top of the affected testicle (blue-dot sign)."
Can kidney stones cause testicular pain and other symptoms and signs?,"'Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain. However, the testicles appear normal with no swelling or redness. Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:' Back (flank) pain and tenderness Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Urinary symptoms, such as blood in the urine, discomfort with urination and urinary frequency"
How are the causes of testicular pain diagnosed?,"""In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a health care professional will perform a complete history and physical exam. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health care professional's initial impression and evaluation.""'Laboratory testing may include:''Imaging studies may be ordered by your health care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.''A color Doppler testicular ''ultrasound'' is a noninvasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.''This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used much less commonly than ultrasound.''CT scan'' or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray ''These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.' Blood work Urinalysis A swab of the urethra (if the patient has penile discharge suggestive of a sexually transmitted disease)"
What is the treatment for testicular pain?,"'The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.''The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:''In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.''The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:''Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.''The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the ''kidney stone'', the size of the ''kidney stone'', and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:''Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as ''lithotripsy'' (the use of ''shock'' waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.''Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with ''urinary tract infection'' and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention are necessary.''The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:''With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.''The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:''Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by ''viruses'' do not require antibiotics.'   Definitive management of testicular torsion requires surgery by a urologist. During surgery, the affected testicle is untwisted, and if it is viable, the testicle is secured to the scrotal wall (orchiopexy). The unaffected testicle may also be secured to prevent testicular torsion from occurring, as some males will have the bell clapper abnormality on both sides. Sometimes, the affected testicle can be manually untwisted by a doctor without necessitating emergent surgery, though this is a temporizing measure that ultimately still requires definitive surgical repair. Likewise, some cases of testicular torsion can occur and then resolve spontaneously, and the health care professional must maintain a high index of suspicion in order for this condition to be diagnosed and ultimately surgically repaired. The more rapidly the testicle is untwisted and blood flow is restored, the better the chances for salvaging the affected testicle. If treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, the salvage rate nears 100%, while after 24 hours the salvage rate is between 0% and 10%. Antibiotics (which may vary depending on the patient's age and sexual history), pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Adequate fluid intake Pain medication Anti- nausea medication In some instances medications such as tamsulosin (Flomax), which may facilitate the passage of kidney stones The treatment for a testicular tumor depends on various factors. A testicular mass is considered cancer until proven otherwise. If testicular cancer is diagnosed, patients are referred to an oncologist who will discuss the different treatment options available. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs The definitive treatment of inguinal hernias requires surgical repair, sometimes electively as an outpatient, while others require intervention on a more emergent basis. Occasionally, inguinal hernias may not be repaired even electively because a patient is too high-risk to undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary in cases of inguinal hernias that are not reducible (unable to be pushed back into the abdomen) and in those cases of strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine). Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs"
What are the complications of causes of testicular pain?,"'The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied. Some individuals may suffer from chronic testicular pain, even after the acute cause of the testicular pain has been treated. Other potential complications may include:'   Permanent damage to the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Infection Cosmetic deformity Epididymitis complications Epididymo-orchitis Abscess (a collection of pus) formation Impaired fertility Systemic blood infection (sepsis) There are no significant complications for torsion of a testicular appendage. Permanent damage to the testicle Atrophy (decrease in size) of the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Abscess formation Cosmetic deformity Testicular torsion Incarceration (hernia unable to be pushed back in) Strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine protruding through the abdominal wall defect) Atrophy of the testicle Impaired fertility Abscess formation Permanent kidney damage Urosepsis (systemic blood infection arising from infected urine) The complications of a testicular tumor vary depending on the underlying type of tumor and the extent of disease."
How can testicular pain be prevented?,"'There are a few measures that you can take to prevent certain causes of testicular pain. However, many of the causes are not entirely preventable.' For epididymitis or bacterial orchitis caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), condom use can reduce the risk of transmission of STDs. The use of appropriate protective gear during sporting activities can help prevent testicular trauma. Mumps immunization can decrease the incidence of viral orchitis."
What is abdominal pain?,"'Abdominal pain'' is felt in the abdomen. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs and ''diaphragm'' above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal ''cavity'' (such as the skin and muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe discomfort originating from organs within the abdominal ''cavity''. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, ''liver'', gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas.''Technically, the lowermost portion of the area described previously, is the pelvis, which contains the urinary bladder and rectum, as well as the ''prostate gland'' in men, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women. Often, it can be difficult to know if lower abdominal pain is coming from the lower abdomen or pelvis (''pelvic pain'').''Occasionally, pain may be felt in the belly even though it is arising from organs that are close to, but not within, the abdominal cavity, for example, conditions of the lower ''lungs'', the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. On the other hand, it also is possible for pain from organs within the belly to be felt outside of the it. For example, the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back. These latter types of pain are described as ""referred” because it does not originate in the location that it is felt. Rather, the cause is located away from where it is felt (i.e., it is referred to a different area).''Picture of the organs and glands in the abdomen.' "
What causes abdominal pain?,"'Abdominal pain is caused by inflammation of an organ (for example, ''appendicitis'', ''diverticulitis'', ''colitis''), by stretching or distention of an organ (for example, obstruction of the intestine, blockage of a bile duct by ''gallstones'', swelling of the liver with ''hepatitis''), or by loss of the supply of blood to an organ (for example, ischemic colitis).''To complicate matters, however, abdominal pain also can occur without inflammation, distention or loss of blood supply. An important example of the latter is the ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''). It is not clear what causes the belly pain in ''IBS'', but it is believed to be due either to abnormal contractions of the intestinal muscles (for example, spasm) or abnormally sensitive nerves within the ''intestines'' that give rise to painful sensations inappropriately (visceral hyper-sensitivity). This often is referred to as functional pain because no recognizable specific abnormality to account for the cause of the pain has been found - at least not yet.'

"Signs, symptoms, locations, types, and severity of abdominal pain","'Doctors will ask you a variety of questions about your belly pain in order to help find the possible causes of it, for example:'   If it comes on suddenly, this may suggest a problem with an organ within the belly; for example, the interruption of the supply of blood to the colon (ischemia) or obstruction of the bile duct by a gallstone (biliary colic). Appendicitis typically causes discomfort in the middle of the abdomen, and then moves to the right lower abdomen, the usual location of the appendix. Diverticulitis typically causes discomfort in the left lower abdomen where most colonic diverticuli are located. Discomfort from the gallbladder (biliary colic or cholecystitis) typically is felt in the middle, upper abdomen or the right upper abdomen near where the gallbladder is located. Is it severe, crampy, steady; or does it wax and wane? Obstruction of the intestine initially causes waves of crampy pain due to contractions of the intestinal muscles and distention of the intestine. True cramp-like pain suggests vigorous contractions of the intestines. Obstruction of the bile ducts by gallstones typically causes steady (constant) upper belly pain that lasts between 30 minutes and several hours. Acute pancreatitis typically causes severe, unrelenting, steady pain in the upper abdomen and upper back. The pain of acute appendicitis initially may start near the umbilicus, but as the inflammation progresses, it moves to the right lower abdomen. The character of pain may change over time. For example, obstruction of the bile ducts sometimes progresses to inflammation of the gallbladder with or without infection (acute cholecystitis). When this happens, the characteristics change to those of inflammatory pain. The discomfort of IBS typically waxes and wanes over months or years and may last for years or decades. Biliary colic lasts no more than several hours. The pain of pancreatitis lasts one or more days. The pain of acid-related diseases - gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or duodenal ulcers - typically occurs over a period of weeks or months that is worse followed by periods of weeks or months during which it is better (periodically). Functional pain may show this same pattern of periodicity. Pain due to inflammation (appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis) typically is aggravated by sneezing, coughing or any jarring motion. Individuals with inflammation prefer to lie still. What health conditions make abdominal pain worse or better? The pain of IBS and constipation often is relieved temporarily by bowel movements and may be associated with changes in bowel habit. Pain due to obstruction of the stomach or upper small intestine may be relieved temporarily by vomiting which reduces the distention that is caused by the obstruction. Eating or taking antacids may temporarily relieve ulcer pain from the stomach or duodenum because both food and antacids neutralize the acid that is responsible for irritating the ulcers and causing the pain. Pain that awakens a patient from sleep is more likely to be due to non-functional causes and is more significant. Other associated symptoms that accompany abdominal pain may suggest: Fever suggests inflammation or infection. Diarrhea or rectal bleeding suggests an intestinal cause. Fever and diarrhea suggest inflammation of the intestines that may be infectious or non-infectious. How is the cause of abdominal pain diagnosed? Doctors determine the cause of the pain by relying on: Its characteristics, physical signs, and other accompanying symptoms Findings on physical examination Medical laboratory, radiological, and endoscopic testing Surgery"

What exams and tests help diagnose the cause of abdominal pain?,"'Examining the patient will provide the doctor with additional clues to the cause of the pain. The doctor will determine:''For example:''While the health history and physical examination are vitally important in determining the cause of abdominal pain, other medical tests often are necessary to determine the cause.''Laboratory tests such as the ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), ''liver enzymes'', pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), ''pregnancy test'' and ''urinalysis'' are frequently ordered.''Plain ''X-rays'' of the abdomen also are referred to as a KUB (because they include the kidney, ureter, and bladder). The KUB may show enlarged loops of intestines filled with copious amounts of fluid and air when there is ''intestinal obstruction''. Patients with a perforated ulcer may have air escape from the stomach into the abdominal cavity. The escaped air often can be seen on a KUB on the underside of the diaphragm. Sometimes a KUB may reveal a calcified ''kidney stone'' that has passed into the ureter and resulted in referred abdominal pain or calcifications in the pancreas that suggest ''chronic pancreatitis''.''Surgery''. Sometimes, diagnosis requires examination of the abdominal cavity either by ''laparoscopy'' or surgery.' The presence of sounds coming from the intestines that occur when there is obstruction of the intestines, The presence of signs of inflammation (by special maneuvers during the examination), The location of any tenderness The presence of a mass within the abdomen that suggests a tumor, enlarged organ, or abscess (a collection of infected pus) The presence of blood in the stool that may signify an intestinal problem such as an ulcer, colon cancer, colitis, or ischemia. Finding tenderness and signs of inflammation in the left lower abdomen often means that diverticulitis is present, while finding a tender (inflamed) mass in the same area may mean that the inflammation has progressed and that an abscess has formed. Finding tenderness and signs of inflammation in the right lower abdomen often means that appendicitis is present, while finding a tender mass in the same area may mean that the inflammation has progressed and that an abscess has formed. Inflammation in the right lower abdomen, with or without a mass, also may be found in Crohn's disease. (Crohn's disease most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine, usually located in the right lower abdomen.) A mass without signs of inflammation may mean that a cancer is present. An elevated white count suggests inflammation or infection (as with appendicitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, or colitis). A low red blood cell count may indicate a bleed in the intestines. Amylase and lipase (enzymes produced by the pancreas) commonly are elevated in pancreatitis. Liver enzymes may be elevated with gallstone attacks or acute hepatitis. Blood in the urine suggests kidney stones. When there is diarrhea, white blood cells in the stool suggest intestinal inflammation or infection. A positive pregnancy test may indicate an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Ultrasound is useful in diagnosing gallstones, cholecystitis appendicitis, or ruptured ovarian cysts as the cause of the pain. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen is useful in diagnosing pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, as well as in diagnosing abscesses in the abdomen. Special CT scans of the abdominal blood vessels can detect diseases of the arteries that block the flow of blood to the abdominal organs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in diagnosing many of the same conditions as CT tomography. Barium X-rays of the stomach and the intestines (upper gastrointestinal series or UGI with a small bowel follow-through) can be helpful in diagnosing ulcers, inflammation, and blockage in the intestines. Computerized tomography (CT) of the small intestine can be helpful in diagnosing diseases in the small bowel such as Crohn's disease. Capsule enteroscopy, uses a small camera the size of a pill swallowed by the patient, which can take pictures of the entire small bowel and transmit the pictures onto a portable receiver. The small bowel images can be downloaded from the receiver onto a computer to be inspected by a doctor later. Capsule enteroscopy can be helpful in diagnosing Crohn's disease, small bowel tumors, and bleeding lesions not seen on x-rays or CT scans. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD is useful for detecting ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), or stomach cancer. Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy is useful for diagnosing infectious colitis, ulcerative colitis, or colon cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is useful for diagnosing pancreatic cancer or gallstones if the standard ultrasound or CT or MRI scans fail to detect them. Balloon enteroscopy, the newest technique allows endoscopes to be passed through the mouth or anus and into the small intestine where small intestinal causes of pain or bleeding can be diagnosed, biopsied, and treated."
How does IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) cause abdominal pain?,"'As previously mentioned, the discomfort of ''irritable bowel'' syndrome is due either to abnormal intestinal muscle contractions or visceral hypersensitivity. Generally, abnormal muscle contractions and visceral hypersensitivity are much more difficult to diagnose than other diseases or other health conditions, particularly since there are no typical abnormalities on physical examination or the usual diagnostic tests. The diagnosis is based on the history (typical symptoms) and the absence of other cause.' "
"Foods, natural remedies, and OTC treatments for certain causes of abdominal pain","'If you aren’t sure if you need to seek medical advice for belly pain, contact your doctor or other health care professional before using any home remedies.''Common home remedies and ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines include:''Some health care professionals recommend:''Some of these may help reduce symptoms, but if symptoms persist, seek medical care. Beware of ""cures"" advertised as a single treatment that can cure all causes of this problem because no such remedy or cure exists.''Taking ''aspirin'' or ''NSAIDs'' should be avoided until the cause of the pain is diagnosed because the medications could make some causes worse (for example, peptic ulcers, intestinal bleeding).' Eat less food Take small amounts of baking soda Use lemon and/or lime juice Start a BRAT diet (banana, rice, applesauce and toast) for a day or so for symptom relief. Don’t smoke or drink alcohol. Taking ginger Peppermint Licorice Chamomile tea Medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), loperamide (Imodium), ranitidine (Zantac) and other over-the-counter substances"
Why can diagnosis of the cause of abdominal pain be difficult?,"'Modern advances in technology have greatly improved the accuracy, speed, and ease of establishing the cause of belly pain, but significant challenges remain. There are many reasons why diagnosing the cause of it can be difficult.' For example, the pain of appendicitis sometimes is located in the right upper abdomen, and of diverticulitis on the right side. Elderly patients and those taking corticosteroids may have little or no pain and tenderness when there is inflammation, for example, with cholecystitis or diverticulitis. This occurs because corticosteroids reduce the inflammation. Ultrasound examinations can miss gallstones, particularly small ones. CT scans may fail to show pancreatic cancer, particularly small ones. The KUB can miss the signs of intestinal obstruction or stomach perforation. Ultrasounds and CT scans may fail to demonstrate appendicitis or even abscesses, particularly if the abscesses are small. The CBC and other blood tests may be normal despite severe infection or inflammation, particularly in individuals receiving corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system. IBS symptoms can mimic bowel obstruction, cancer, ulcer, gallbladder attacks, or even appendicitis. Crohn's disease can mimic appendicitis. Infection of the right kidney can mimic acute cholecystitis. A ruptured right ovarian cyst can mimic appendicitis; while a ruptured left ovarian cyst can mimic diverticulitis. Kidney stones can mimic appendicitis or diverticulitis. Examples discussed previously include the extension of the inflammation of pancreatitis to involve the entire abdomen and the progression of biliary colic to cholecystitis."
What medications can be used to treat certain causes of abdominal pain?,"'Medications that are used for the treatment of underlying cause(s) of the pain are the medications of choice. For example, medications are not needed for the treatment of simple viral ''gastroenteritis'' (''stomach flu'' or stomach bug), while surgery and/or ''chemotherapy'' may be the best approach to treat certain ''cancers'' in the abdomen. Other causes may require antispasmodics, antimicrobials, H2 blockers, or even ''nitrates'' or morphine. The diagnosed cause usually narrows the choice of medications. A few causes can only be treated by surgery (for example incarcerated ''hernia'', ''abdominal adhesions'' from previous surgeries, and certain abdominal injuries), although some medications may be used (for example, morphine) while the person is waiting to have surgery.'  "
What lifestyle choices can I make to prevent abdominal pain?,"'Lifestyle changes really depend on the cause of the pain.' Eat a healthy diet, exercise, and avoid smoking and excess alcohol consumption to reduce the chances that you will experience certain causes. Good hygiene, especially hand washing and avoiding materials and foods contaminated with viruses and bacteria will reduce your chances of developing illness from many infectious causes."
When should I call my doctor about abdominal pain?,"'Some doctors suggest that if you have a ""less serious"" cause of abdominal pain you likely won’t need to see a doctor if the symptoms resolve in about 24 to 48 hours. For example, if you have viral or bacterial ''food poisoning'', have had discomfort, but aren’t dehydrated.''If you have a chronic problem that occasionally causes abdominal discomfort, most doctors suggest you contact the person treating you for the ailment for an appointment or prescription (refill). However, if you have any of the problems or symptoms listed in the ""serious abdominal pain ""section above, you should seek immediate medical care.' "
What is coccydynia?,'Inflammation of the tailbone (coccyx or bony area located deep between the buttocks above the anus) is referred to as coccydynia. Coccydynia is associated with pain and tenderness at the tip of the tailbone between the buttocks. Sitting often worsens coccyx pain.' 
What causes coccydynia?,"'An injury or ''trauma'' may cause inflammation of the coccyx, but it may occur seemingly spontaneously. There are many causes of tailbone pain that can mimic coccydynia, including ''sciatica'', infection (including ''shingles'' of the buttocks), pilonidal ''cysts'', sacroiliitis, and ''fractured bone'' (broken tailbone or tailbone ''fracture'').' "
What are risk factors for coccydynia?,'The major risk factor for coccydynia is injury to the coccyx or pelvic bones.' 
What are coccydynia symptoms and signs?,"'Pain and local tenderness that occur at the coccyx are the major symptoms of coccydynia. Tailbone pain can lead to difficulty sitting or leaning against the buttocks. Along with the coccyx pain with sitting, there is typically exquisite pain at the tailbone area.'  "
How do doctors diagnose coccydynia?,"'Doctors may diagnose coccyx inflammation based solely on the symptoms and the examination findings of local pain. Other conditions can be excluded by the examination (such as ''shingles'', which typically would be associated with local ''rash'') and other testing (to exclude bone or tissue disorders, such as with CAT scan or ''MRI'' scan).' "
What is the medical treatment for coccydynia?,"'Patients with coccydynia are advised to use a well-padded seat when sitting and avoid long periods of sitting when possible. If the condition becomes severe or persistently troublesome, then medical attention should be sought to accurately evaluate the cause of the pain, especially if there is associated ''bruising'' or ''rash''.''Rest, avoiding reinjury to the affected area, anti-inflammatory medications, and pain medications can relieve symptoms. Sitting on a pillow, cushion, or buttock support can help. Treatment for patients with persistent coccydynia involves local cortisone injections. This ''corticosteroid'"" shot is simply performed in the doctor's office and can potentially dramatically relieve ""'chronic pain'' and even resolve the symptoms for many. Sometimes, the injection includes fluoroscopy or ''ultrasound'"". Physical therapy with exercises can be helpful with a patient's recovery. Rarely, when patients have unrelenting or severe coccyx pain, surgery can be performed on the coccyx to remove the irritated bony prominence.""  "
What is the prognosis for coccydynia?,'The majority of people with coccydynia have complete recovery in response to the conservative treatments described above.' 
Is it possible to prevent coccydynia?,"'Because coccydynia is associated with injury, avoiding trauma to the ''coccyx bone'' is the best method of preventing coccydynia.' "
Facts you should know about toothaches,"'A ''toothache'' is ''pain'' that occurs in or around a tooth. The ''pain'' originates from within a tooth or the surrounding gum and bone structures. One usually feels toothache pain as a constant or intermittent ache that does not go away. Temperature changes, such as exposure to ''cold'' ''drinks'' or pressure on the tooth while chewing, can stimulate a toothache. In other instances, ''tooth pain'' can arise spontaneously without any stimulation. ''Odontalgia'' is another name for a toothache.'""It's hard to ignore an aching tooth while eating or going about one's day. Persistent pain urges us to find out how to get rid of a toothache. While bothersome, it is a way for the painful tooth or area to signal that one should seek some attention and care from a dentist before things get worse.""  "
What causes a toothache?,"'Injury or ''trauma'' to the tooth or area usually cause toothaches. Injury is commonly a result of ''tooth decay'' (or ''cavity''). People usually feel ''cavities'"" when they get larger and deeper into the layers of tooth structure. Enamel is the hard, outer layer of tooth, and dentin is the softer layer beneath the enamel. Dentin is the tooth's sensitive layer with tiny microscopic tubes that originate from the very center of the tooth. The pulp chamber (the center of the tooth) contains the pulp. The pulp is comprised of blood vessels and nerves. If decay gets past enamel into the dentin, the ""'cavity'' can sometimes cause discomfort. A deeper cavity that approaches the center of the tooth will likely cause pain since there is more damage to the tooth and there is less tooth structure to insulate and protect the pulp. Localized infection between the gum and tooth (periodontal ''abscess'') can cause toothache. A traumatic physical blow to a tooth can induce a sore tooth, as well.''Other causes of toothache include the following:' Abscessed tooth: This infection originates from within the tooth and spreads to the root and the surrounding bone. Damaged or fractured tooth: Fracture of a tooth can expose the sensitive dentin or even the pulp. Sometimes fractures are not obvious even though the fracture line can run deep into the tooth, causing tooth pain every time one puts pressure on it with biting or chewing (called ""cracked tooth syndrome""). Dental work: After getting a filling or crown, the tooth can feel more sensitive. This is especially the case if the removal of tooth decay was large or deep. Dental work, although necessary, can sometimes irritate the nerve. Over time, the sensitivity can resolve if the tooth is healthy enough. Teeth clenching or grinding: This habit is called bruxism and is oftentimes done unconsciously and at night. Unfortunately, bruxism causes damage to teeth and sometimes irritates the nerves to the point where teeth become sensitive. Gum infection or gum disease: The periodontium consists of the gum, gum ligament, and bone that surround and anchor the teeth. Early stages of gum problems usually involve inflamed gum, called gingivitis. The gum is usually red, swollen and will bleed easily. A gum problem can progress to include the jawbone surrounding teeth and represents the later stages of gum disease (or ""periodontitis"") where there is advanced loss of bone around the teeth. Because of bone loss, a gum abscess (infection) can form in the space that develops between the tooth and the gum, causing pain. Exposed root surfaces: When the protective bone and gum no longer cover the roots of teeth, these surfaces can be sensitive to stimuli such as brushing the teeth or temperature changes. Sinusitis: Because the roots of the upper molars are very close to the maxillary sinus cavities, inflammation from the sinus cavities can cause these molars to be sensitive and feel like a toothache. Third molars (""wisdom teeth""): Third molars, also called wisdom teeth, are the very last permanent teeth to appear in the mouth. More often than not, there is not enough space for these molars in the mouth. As a result, third molars become fully or partially trapped (impacted) within the jawbone and below the gum. Because of poor accessibility, it is difficult to properly clean partially exposed third molars; therefore, these areas are susceptible to problems. Problems with third molars can cause dull to severe pain from pressure of eruption, gum infection, or dental decay."
What are toothache symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms that can might indicate a tooth problem are''A toothache can present as a dull or sharp pain that may arise spontaneously on its own or by stimulation.''Additional symptoms may include'   pain with biting or chewing, teeth hypersensitivity to changes in temperature, cheek or gums swelling near tooth, discharge or bleeding of gums, constant throbbing within a tooth. headache, neck pain, earache, fever, bad taste or odor in the mouth."
How do health care professionals diagnose a toothache?,"'The dentist performs a series of diagnostic tests along with ''dental X-rays'' to determine the origin of a toothache. These tests try to mimic what may be causing the pain, such as cold stimuli, biting or chewing pressure, and finger pressure on the gums. The response to a cold stimuli test can help in determining whether a tooth is vital (nerve is intact within tooth) or suffering from pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp). Determining duration and acuity of pain from cold stimuli can help diagnose and determine treatment.''Sometimes, the cause of a toothache may come from somewhere different from where pain is actually felt (called ""referred pain""). For these situations, diagnostic tests performed by the dentist are particularly important in accurately detecting the problem.' "
What is the treatment for a toothache?,"'Toothache treatment depends on the cause of the pain and how much damage is present. In general, the best way to stop a toothache is for the dentist to remove any present infection or decay and repair the damage to protect exposed, sensitive areas. For a shallow cavity on a tooth, a dentist removes the decay and seals the tooth with a filling. If the cavity is very deep and gets into the pulp, the dentist performs ""''root canal'' treatment"" because the pulp has been exposed and infected with bacteria. This procedure essentially removes all the vital contents of the tooth (nerves and blood vessels) and seals the inner aspects of the tooth (root canal system) with an inert filling material. An abscessed tooth that has very localized infection usually needs root canal treatment with antibiotic therapy. If the infection has become widespread, one may need antibiotic therapy and additional steps to properly drain the infection. Dentists often prescribe pain medications to manage the pain. Sometimes extraction of the tooth may be the only option for treatment if the tooth or surrounding gum and bone are too damaged.''For a periodontal abscess, a dentist performs a simple drainage procedure under local anesthesia. Additionally, a dentist thoroughly cleans the affected gum pocket to remove any tartar buildup and debris. Once cleaned, the pocket is irrigated with an antimicrobial rinse containing chlorhexidine. Sometimes, antibiotics are locally administered into the pocket to further aid in healing. Depending on the extent of the abscess, a dentist may prescribe oral antibiotics. Additionally, for the short-term, a dentist may prescribe chlorhexidine oral rinse as a mouthwash to aid in healing. The area should be kept clean with gentle tooth brushing and warm water rinses. A follow-up visit is recommended to make sure the infection has completely resolved and develop a plan to properly maintain the area.''For tooth fractures or cracked tooth syndrome situations, ''dental crown'' placement is the usual treatment. A crown will replace missing tooth structure and/or it will help protect the weakened tooth from further breakdown and sensitivity.'  "
Are home remedies effective for a toothache?,"'Generally, home remedies are only effective as a temporary measure to calm severe tooth pain and are not intended to cure the problem. How does one try to get instant relief without the aid of a dental professional? Oral pain medication will be a key step. ''Over-the-counter'' pain medicines such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' and are best taken on a schedule to provide pain relief. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an alternative painkiller. In some cases, alternating doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is effective.''The essential oil, clove oil, is a toothache remedy that is actually an ingredient in some sedative dental filling materials. It is a natural home remedy that has a numbing effect and can provide instant relief. Clove oil (eugenol) can be found at the pharmacy. Small amounts of clove oil should be used to the affected area. Dilute a few drops in a teaspoon of olive oil to avoid burning the mouth tissue. Before application of the diluted clove oil, rinse the mouth thoroughly with warm salt water or warm water to clear any debris from the affected area. Then, place a small cotton ball soaked with a few drops of the diluted clove oil on the tooth or gum area. Allow a few minutes after application for the numbing effect to take place. Other products that contain benzocaine (including Orajel or Anbesol) can temporarily numb the affected tooth or gums and provide pain relief as well. If clove oil is not available, plain olive oil can also provide some relief by coating a painful area.''To help a toothache until treatment can be found, one should avoid chewing on the affected tooth/area and minimize extreme temperatures of hot and cold. Keeping the area clean and free of food debris may help as well. Warm salt water or plain warm water rinses can help soothe the affected area and keep the mouth clean. If swelling of the surrounding gums or tissues is present, immediate treatment with a dentist or physician is advised to avoid the spread of infection. Home remedies may temporarily alleviate pain but do not to treat infection.''Above all, proper diagnosis and timely treatment by a dentist is strongly advised to effectively treat a toothache.'  "
How is a toothache treated in pregnancy?,"'Dentists can safely perform treatment during ''pregnancy'' as long as a few guidelines are followed.''Generally, if dental work is required to treat a toothache, the recommended time for treatment is during the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy. However, if there is a risk of infection or severe pain, dental treatment may need to be performed at any point during a pregnancy. The obstetrician is consulted on what would be the safest option to avoid any possible complications during dental treatment.''If a dental X-ray is needed, a lead apron is always used for every patient. For a ''pregnant'' patient, this is particularly important in protecting the unborn child.''Careful consideration should be made to ensure that any medications that are used are safe during pregnancy. This applies to local anesthetics administered during dental treatment and antibiotics (such as ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Trimox'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid'']) taken before or after treatment. Over-the-counter drugs such as ''aspirin'', ibuprofen, or naproxen are avoided as these are not considered safe during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is considered safe for ''pain management''.'  "
What is the prognosis for a toothache?,"'For the most part, the prognosis is good for a toothache. In this era of modern dental care, dentists can quickly identify the problem and treat it effectively. The outcome is best when toothache is treated as early as possible to avoid further damage or risk of spreading infection.' "
Is it possible to prevent a toothache?,"'Conscientious efforts to practice good oral hygiene go a long way in preventing dental problems. Toothbrushing with fluoride ''toothpaste'' and use of dental floss are essential to good dental care at home. Furthermore, regular maintenance visits with a dentist can serve to keep things in check. Small cavities can be found before turning into larger cavities or an abscessed tooth. Gum problems, including periodontal abscess, can be addressed before advancing to a more diseased state.''To keep teeth strong, avoid the habit of chewing on ice or very hard foods that can cause tooth fractures. Using our teeth as a tool to open a bag of potato chips or cracking open a nutshell increase the chances of a tooth fracture as well. Minimize high ''sugar'' content foods or ''beverages'' to decrease the risk of dental decay. Be mindful of acidity in beverages as this can be a source of sensitivity and cavities for teeth.' "
What is vaginal pain (vulvodynia)?,"'Vulvodynia refers to pain in the area of the vulva and vaginal opening. Vulvodynia is considered pain for which there is no known cause. It is different from pain that is located deep in the pelvis or internally in the vagina. ''This article focuses on pain in the vulvar region and at the opening (introitus) of the vagina. ''Deeper vaginal pain can also occur due to infections, tumors, and conditions that cause more generalized pain in the pelvic organs.' Vaginal pain can be chronic and can last for years in some women. The degree of severity varies among women. It often occurs in the absence of physical signs or visible abnormalities. It can be severe and can interfere with sexual activity and cause painful intercourse (dyspareunia). However, there are a number of other causes of vaginal pain during or after sex."
What are the signs and symptoms of vaginal pain?,"'The pain of vulvodynia can be debilitating and interfere with daily activities and sexual intercourse. It can make women feel a loss of control their bodies, causing profound emotional and physical discomfort.''Symptoms of vulvodynia and vaginal pain may include:''Some women report pain that is localized to one side or one area of the vulva, while others have more generalized and widespread pain. Usually, no physical signs or changes occur in and around the vagina with vulvodynia; however, sometimes the skin may be inflamed.'   Burning or stinging pain in the vulva or vaginal opening Sharp, aching, or throbbing pain in the vagina or vulva Vaginal itching, sometimes with pain Pain that is constant or comes and goes Pain that occurs during sex or exercise"
What if you have vaginal pain during pregnancy?,'Vaginal pain may occur during the ''third trimester'' of ''pregnancy'' due to an increase in pressure on the cervix. Women who experienced vulvodynia before ''becoming pregnant'' may continue to experience this symptom during pregnancy.'  
What causes vaginal pain?,"'It is unclear why some women develop vulvodynia. It is not thought to be related to sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''), although some women with vulvodynia have had multiple STDs. Some theories suggest that vulvodynia may be related to''Familial or genetic factors also have been suggested to play a role in vulvodynia. Unfortunately, the exact cause has not been determined and most women have no known contributing factors.' damage or irritation of nerves, abnormal responses to irritation or inflammation, allergic reactions, muscle spasms, a history of sexual abuse, or frequent use of antibiotics."
What are risk factors for vaginal pain? Who gets it?,"'Since the cause is poorly understood, it is difficult to predict who is at risk for vulvodynia. It can affect women of all ages and races. It can begin as early as adolescence and can occur both before and after ''menopause''. It may occur during the ''menstrual period'' or independent of the menstrual period.' "
What exams and procedures can diagnose the cause of vaginal paint?,"'No specific tests confirm vulvodynia. Usually, vaginal pain and vulvodynia are diagnosed based upon the characteristic symptoms of the condition. However, since vulvar and vaginal infections, (for example, yeast infections, ''bacterial vaginosis'', and ''vaginitis'') are associated with vaginal burning and ''itching'', cultures or other diagnostic tests may be ordered to rule out vaginal infections.' "
What is the treatment for vaginal pain and vulvodynia? Can the condition be cured?,"'Vulvodynia is a chronic condition (it may last for months to years) in some women; in others, it may come and go. Vulvodynia and vaginal pain can be managed using medical treatments and self-care (home remedies). Not all treatments will be effective for every woman, and a woman may have to try different treatments to find the most effective option for her.''Vulvodynia is not associated with ''cancer'' or with any serious medical diseases, but it may be a source of ''chronic pain'' and emotional discomfort for some women.'  "
What medications and home therapies can relieve vaginal pain?,"'Some of the medications that have been useful include:''Other medical therapies for women with severe vulvodynia include:'   Topical estrogen creams Topical or local anesthetics Tricyclic antidepressants Anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications are sometimes useful in managing chronic pain) Injections of interferon or nerve blocks, in which medications are injected to reduce signaling from nerves in the affected areas Biofeedback training and pelvic floor exercises have been helpful for some women. Surgical removal of affected tissue can be of benefit in women with vulvodynia due to vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, a particular type of vulvodynia that is located at the area of the hymenal ring."
What treatments and home remedies help relieve pain?,"'Home remedies and self-care measures for vulvodynia can bring relief for many women. Some self-care measures to relieve the pain of vulvodynia include:'   Rinsing the area with cool water, particularly after urination and sexual activity Soaking in cool or warm sitz baths Using topical ice packs wrapped in a towel Heating pad use, in contrast, may help some women Using mild, unscented soaps and detergent Using white, unscented toilet tissue Wearing white cotton underwear Wearing loose-fitting clothing and avoiding stockings or pantyhose Avoiding pools or hot tubs with chlorinated water Using a water-soluble lubricant during sexual intercourse Avoiding activities such as bicycling, that put pressure on the vulvar area Keeping the vulvar area dry and clean Avoiding food that can make the urine more irritating to the skin of the genital area. These foods include beans, berries, nuts, and chocolate Over-the-counter antihistamines can help reduce itching, particularly at night"
Facts you should know about whiplash injuries, Whiplash is a relatively common injury that is often ignored or mistreated due to lack of understanding of the condition. Whiplash is usually the result of a rear impact while in a stationary position. Early range of motion and exercises lead to a more rapid recovery than prolonged immobilization or use of a cervical collar. Failure to properly educate and treat patients with whiplash can lead to chronic psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety.
What is whiplash?,"'Whiplash is a relatively common injury that occurs to a person\'s neck following a sudden acceleration-deceleration force that causes unrestrained, rapid forward and backward movement of the head and neck, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term ""whiplash"" was first used in 1928. The term ""railway spine"" was used to describe a similar condition that was common in persons involved in train accidents prior to 1928. The term ""whiplash injury"" describes damage to both the bone structures and soft tissues, while ""whiplash associated disorders"" describes a more severe and chronic condition.''Fortunately, whiplash is typically not a life threatening injury, but it can lead to a prolonged period of partial disability. There are significant economic expenses related to whiplash that can reach 30 billion dollars a year in the United States, including:''While most people involved in minor motor vehicle accidents recover quickly without any chronic symptoms, some continue to experience symptoms for years after the injury. This wide variation in symptoms after relatively minor injuries has led some to suggest that, in many cases, whiplash is not so much a real physiologic injury, but that symptoms are more created as a result of potential economic gain. Many clinical studies have investigated this issue. Unfortunately, while there will always be people willing to attempt to mislead the system for personal gain, whiplash is a real condition with real symptoms.'   medical care,  disability,  sick leave,  lost productivity, and litigation."
What causes whiplash?,"""Whiplash is most commonly caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the person is in a car that is not moving, and is struck by another vehicle from behind. It is commonly thought the rear impact causes the head and neck to be forced into hyperextended (backward) position as the seat pushes the person's torso forward - and the unrestrained head and neck fall backwards. After a short delay the head and neck then recover and are thrown into a hyperflexed (forward) position.""'More recent studies investigating high-speed cameras and sophisticated crash dummies have determined that after the rear impact the lower cervical vertebrae (lower bones in the neck) are forced into a position of ''hyperextension'' while the upper cervical vertebrae (upper bones in the neck) are in a ''hyperflexed'' position. This leads to an abnormal S-shape in the cervical spine after the rear impact that is different from the normal motion. It is thought that this abnormal motion causes damage to the soft tissues that hold the cervical vertebrae together (ligaments, facet capsules, muscles). ' "
What are the symptoms of whiplash?,"'Common symptoms related to whiplash may include:''In a more severe and chronic case of ""whiplash associated disorder"" symptoms may include:''Patients with whiplash injuries may enter into litigation and ''social isolation'' may occur as a result of their symptoms.'   neck pain and stiffness, headache,  shoulder pain and stiffness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  jaw pain (temporomandibular joint symptoms),  arm pain,  arm weakness,  visual disturbances,  ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and  back pain.  depression,  anger,  frustration,  anxiety,  stress,  drug dependency,  post-traumatic stress syndrome,  sleep disturbance (insomnia), "
How do medical professionals diagnose whiplash?,"""After an accident the patient may be taken to the hospital or a doctor's office to be examined. The doctor will examine the patient to determine if they have any injuries that require treatment. Based on the symptoms and examination findings the doctor may place a collar on the neck for additional support. The doctor may also obtain ""'X-rays'' of the neck to check for more serious injury. The most important first step is to make sure there is no major injury to the neck, head or the rest of the body requiring immediate treatment.''If the X-rays are normal but the patient continues to have ''neck pain'', the doctor may keep the cervical collar in place and see the patient back in the office in about a week for an additional examination. At that time, the doctor may obtain new X-rays to see if there have been any changes. If the doctor is still concerned about soft tissue injuries, he or she may obtain either X-rays with the head leaning forward and backward\xa0(dynamic X-rays) or obtain an ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'' study). These dynamic X-rays or MRI scans are better able to detect injuries to the soft tissues of the neck, especially instability, that may not been seen with normal X-rays of the neck.' "
What is the treatment for whiplash?,"'Treatment of whiplash depends on the wide variety of symptoms present. Unfortunately, most treatments of whiplash have not been well tested to determine their effectiveness.''The most important issue in the management of whiplash is optimal education of the patient about their injury. This includes information on the cause, potential treatments, and likely outcomes. Patients should understand that this is a real injury, but that nearly all patients have the ability to fully recover. Patients that do not receive this information are much more likely to develop the more chronic ""whiplash associated disorder.""''In the past, the initial treatment for whiplash was often a soft cervical collar for several weeks. The goal of the collar was intended to reduce the range of motion of the neck and to prevent any additional injuries. More recent studies have shown that this prolonged immobilization actually slows the healing process. If there is no evidence of abnormal spinal alignment, early range of motion is advised.''Patients involved in early range of motion exercises have been shown to have a more reliable and rapid improvement in their symptoms. This treatment typically involves rotational exercises performed 10 times per hour as soon as symptoms allow within the first four days of the accident.''It seems that excessive rest and immobilization have been shown to have greater chances of chronic symptoms. This is explained by loss of range of motion leading to increased ''pain'' and stiffness. Immobilization also causes muscle atrophy (muscle wasting), decreased blood flow to the injured soft tissues, and healing of damaged muscles in shortened position that renders them less flexible.''Physical therapy can be useful in helping to wean a patient from a cervical collar as well as to help strengthen muscles and reduce painful motions. Occupational therapy can be used to help return the patient to the work environment.''If the patient begins to develop psychological symptoms including anger, ''anxiety'' or ''depression'' following an injury, prompt treatment of the emotional condition is recommended. This can help the patient better understand the good chances for successful recovery and reduce the chances of chronic symptoms.'  "
What can people do to prevent whiplash?,"'While it is not always possible to prevent accidents, advances in automobile safety have attempted to reduce the associated risks. Many advances in seat belts and head restraints have been able to reduce the risk of whiplash injury. The proper use of these devices is crucial to their success in preventing injury. Head restraints are designed to prevent the head from moving into hyperextension when struck from behind. In order for this to work properly, the head restraint should be optimally positioned directly behind the head. If the head restraint is lowered below the level of the head it could actually force the head into further hyperextension after an impact. Many automobiles have additional safety equipment including air ''bags'' and air curtains to further protect drivers and passengers from injury.' "
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''. Systemic disorders such as ''diabetes mellitus'', ''hyperthyroidism'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, and tumors such as ''pheochromocytoma'' and ''lymphoma'' have been associated with secondary hyperhidrosis.'  "
What signs and symptoms accompany hyperhidrosis?,"'Generally, the only sign of excessive sweating is the presence of abundant moisture in the anatomical area affected. The presence of this moisture can predispose to skin infections.''As stated above, there are a number of conditions and diseases that produce secondary hyperhidrosis. Treating the underlying condition can help relieve at least some of the excessive sweating.''The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweat.''Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating ''skin conditions''. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hyperhidrosis?,"""The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination. If the sweating is excessive and constant, then the diagnosis is obvious. It is not unusual that one must rely on the patient's history to determine the diagnosis. Research centers measure sweat production by comparing the weight of filter paper left on the skin for a specified interval before and after sweating.""'Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
What are medical treatment options for hyperhidrosis?,"'Through a systematic evaluation of causes and triggers of excessive sweating, followed by a judicious, stepwise approach to medical treatment, many people with this annoying disorder can achieve improved quality of life. The decision on initial treatment depends upon the severity of the condition and the anatomical areas that are affected.''The approach to treating hyperhidrosis generally proceeds as follows:''When regular antiperspirants fail, as they often do, to remedy hyperhidrosis, most doctors start by recommending aluminum chloride hexahydrate (''Drysol'', various generics), a prescription-strength version of aluminum chloride. It is applied just before bedtime seven to 10 nights in a row, then roughly once a week as a maintenance medication. The aluminum salts in this preparation collect in the sweat ducts of the patient and block them. Over time, the excessive ''perspiration'"" may diminish to such an extent that no further treatment is needed. This method works reasonably well for many patients whose problem is excessive underarm sweating, but it's not satisfactory for most of those with clammy palms and sweating of the soles of the ""'feet''.''The main side effect with aluminum chloride is irritation, which can sometimes, but not always, be overcome by reducing the frequency of use or applying anti-inflammatory medications such as lotions containing hydrocortisone.'""Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago to treat excessive sweating. Its exact mechanism of action is still unclear. The procedure uses water to conduct an electric current to the skin, which combats the production of sweat. The current is applied typically for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with two to three sessions per week followed by a maintenance program of treatments at one- to three-week intervals, depending upon the patient's response. Iontophoresis treatments sound painful but in fact are not.""""Patients purchase devices for this treatment through a doctor's prescription. There are three iontophoresis devices that are registered with and cleared by the U.S. FDA; the R.A. Fischer and the Hidrex USA devices require a prescription, whereas the Drionic device is available without a prescription. They work best on palms and soles but can be adapted for use in the underarms. Medical insurers sometimes cover the cost.""'Oral anticholinergic drugs such as ''glycopyrrolate'' (''Robinul''), ''oxybutynin'', and ''propantheline'' bromide can be quite effective for this condition, but they can produce side effects like ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', and ''blurred vision''. The dosage should be titrated carefully.''Topical anticholinergic pads''Recently, a new topical treatment using glycopyrronium tosylate impregnated gauze pads (Qbrexza) has received approval for the treatment of axillary (armpit) hyperhidrosis.''Botulinum toxin (Botox), a muscle poison much in the news as a cosmetic treatment for ''wrinkles'', has actually been used in many areas of medicine for some time, such as in the treatment of ''muscle spasms'' and certain types of ''headaches''. Its latest medical use is for treating excessive underarm sweating.''Botox is injected into tissues of the armpit or hand. The drug works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which is the chemical that activates sweat glands. This may produce approximately six months of relief from sweating. The injections are uncomfortable, but use of a very small needle minimizes discomfort.''Now that this treatment option has received FDA approval, many health insurers are providing coverage for the injections and the Botox itself, which is quite costly.''Currently, the FDA has not approved Botox for treating sweating of the palms and soles of the feet, though some physicians are administering it as an off-label use, with some success. Drawbacks of using this treatment for the palms and soles are ''pain'', requiring ''nerve blocks'' to numb the hands in order to make the injections tolerable, and the potential for temporary muscle ''weakness''.'""These new techniques produce energy that presumably destroys sweat glands while preserving other tissues. Currently, only the armpits seem to be appropriate treatment sites. Treatments occur in a doctor's office and in recent studies have been accompanied by local swelling and irritation as well as a variety of other relatively minor side effects. Sweating seems to be significantly decreased for a time with these treatments. How these would be used in other anatomical areas aside from the armpits is not clear.""   Over-the-counter antiperspirants: Patients usually try home remedies like these first because they are readily available. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride (for example, Certain-Dri) may be more effective when other antiperspirants have failed. So-called ""natural"" antiperspirants are often not very helpful for patients. Prescription-strength antiperspirants: those containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate Iontophoresis: a device that uses a direct current to drive ions into the sweat gland using tap water occasionally mixed with aluminum ions or other substances Oral medications: from the group of medications known as anticholinergics, which reduce sweating Topical medicated pads: pads impregnated with anticholinergic medications for use in the armpits Botox (botulinum toxin): approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating excessive axillary sweating Microwave destruction: a device destroys the sweat glands, purportedly causing minimal damage to other tissues Surgery: paraspinal sympathectomy, or interruption of certain nerve pathways, as a last resort"
Are there home remedies for hyperhidrosis?,"'Over-the-counter antiperspirants may be effective, but usually the patient has already tried these.' "
Can surgery treat hyperhidrosis? What are potential side effects of surgery for hyperhidrosis?,"'Localized axillary hyperhidrosis has been treated by surgical removal of a substantial portion of axillary skin. Another approach is the use of ''liposuction'' curettage, although how this effectively damages the dermal sweat glands is hard to visualize.''Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) refers to surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves responsible for sweating. Sympathectomy is an operation intended to destroy part of the nerve supply to the sweat glands in the skin. The surgeon inserts a special endoscopic instrument into the chest between two ribs just below the armpit. The lung is briefly deflated to better visualize and destroy the nerves. Sympathectomy is both effective and risky. Even with newer endoscopic techniques, complications of the procedure can include compensatory, excessive sweating in other parts of the body as well as lung and nerve problems. As many of these complications are serious and not reversible, this option is rarely used, and then only as a last resort.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hyperhidrosis?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent hyperhidrosis.''Most hyperhidrosis patients can be effective and safely treated.' "

What are palpitations?,"'Palpations are sensations by a person that they are having hard, rapid, or irregular heartbeats or a combination of these sensations.''A brief description of the ''heart'""'s function that should help readers to better understand ""'palpitations'"". The heart is a two-stage electrical pump whose function is to circulate blood to the organs and tissues of the body. The heart's electrical system allows the heart muscle to beat in a coordinated fashion to maximize the pumping strength of the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart, and make certain that there is an adequate amount of blood to be pumped.""'The upper chambers of the heart, called the atria (single=''atrium'') collect blood from the body and ''lungs'"" and pump it into the ventricles. There needs to be a short delay to allow the ventricles to fill and then pump the blood back to the body and lungs to complete the cycle. The heart's electrical system allows this to happen, so that each chamber of the heart beats (contracts or squeezes) when it's supposed to.""'The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a collection of special cells embedded in the heart muscle of the ''right atrium''. They act as the ''pacemaker'' for the heart by generating an electrical impulse 60 to 80 times per minute. This signal is transmitted to all the atrial muscle cells so that they can fire at the same time and pump blood from the ''atrium'' to the ventricle, the first half of a heartbeat. At the same time, an electrical impulse is sent to the ''atrioventricular node'' (''AV node''), located in the junction between the ''atrium'' and ventricle. The ''AV node'' acts as an electrical junction box and delays the electrical signal for a fraction of a second so that the ventricle can fill with blood from the atrium. It then sends the signal to all the muscle cells of the ventricle so that they can fire together in a coordinated fashion and generate the second half of the heartbeat that pumps blood to the body.''Every heart muscle cell has the potential to generate an electrical signal that can spread outside the normal conduction pathways that may or may not generate a heartbeat. If the SA node fails to function, other cells in the atrium attempt to generate a heartbeat. If they too should fail, the ''AV node'' can act as a pacemaker but usually generates a signal at only 40 beats per minute. If the AV node should also fail, the ventricle itself can generate its own electrical signal as a final backup, but only at about 20 beats per minute.''A palpitation describes the sensation that occurs when a patient feels an abnormality in the normal beat of the heart. Abnormalities in the electrical conducting system may cause the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly, or irregularly. Sometimes a palpitation may be a normal variant but it may also be caused by a significant problem that could be life threatening. A palpitation may be an isolated extra heartbeat or it may describe a run of many extra beats that run together for a prolonged period. Sometimes a missed beat or a pause can be felt.'  "
What are the different types of palpitations?,"'There are different types of palpitations depending upon where in the heart the electrical signal is generated and whether that signal can generate a heartbeat. Many extra heartbeats are normal variants and most patients are unaware that their heart has had an extra beat or two; however, others may be dangerous causing short- and long-term complications. Palpitations that originate in the atrium tend not to be acutely life threatening as compared to those that originate in the ventricle.''Palpitations are often described based upon their source location (atrium, AV node, or ventricle), their frequency (isolated or clustered in runs of many beats together), whether the beats are regular in rhythm or irregular, and whether they are persistent or stop on their own (self-limited). However, some palpitations are symptoms of an ''arrhythmia''. Some investigators do not include certain arrhythmias when discussing palpitations, but others include them as possible symptoms patients notice during these arrhythmias. This article will include these arrhythmias.''PACs and ''PVCs''A premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when the SA node generates a beat before the heart is quite ready and while a heartbeat is generated, it can feel as if there is a thump or flop in the chest. Because of its early timing, a PAC is often followed by a slight pause as the SA node resets itself. A PAC is a normal variant and may or may not be felt by a patient.''A ''premature ventricular contraction'' (''PVC'') is similarly caused by an early beat by the ventricle, usually caused by an extra electrical beat generated in a muscle cell located in the ventricle. Since it is early, the patient can feel a thump as the heartbeat is slightly misplaced in its normal cycle. As with PACs, PVCs may be asymptomatic and the patient may be unaware that they are occurring. Neither an occasional PAC nor PVC affects ''heart function''.''Supraventricular tachycardia''Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a general term that describes a rapid heartbeat that arises from electrical signals generated above the ventricle from within the atrium. It may occur due to outside forces acting upon the heart or because of ""a short circuit"" or abnormal wiring of the electrical conduction system.''SVT may be a normal physiologic response to a ''stress'' upon the body. When the body requires more oxygen, it releases adrenaline, which causes the heart to beat faster to increase blood circulation. This may occur as a response to ''exercise'', illness, or injury.''SVT may also occur because of electrical conducting system abnormalities within the atrium and the AV node and may occur without an apparent underlying cause. This is referred to as ''paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia'' or ''PSVT''. This rhythm may start and stop on its own, seemingly without reason or warning, and may last only a few seconds or may require emergency intervention for it to stop.''There can be inborn wiring errors of the heart that can cause special forms of PSVT. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is one example and palpitations may occur early in life or not be experienced until later in adulthood.''SVT may be caused by chemicals that appear similar to adrenaline to the heart. These include ''caffeine'', ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' medications containing pseudoephedrine, ''alcohol'', and other stimulant ''drugs'' like amphetamine and ''cocaine''. Excess ''thyroid hormone'' or ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the bloodstream may irritate the atria and precipitate SVT.''While ''anxiety'' may cause the patient to experience these types of palpitations, the health care professional may want to consider other potential causes before ascribing this diagnosis.''Atrial fibrillation'' and ''flutter''In some patients, the atrial muscle cells all act like pacemakers, generating an electrical impulse. This causes electrical chaos and the atria cannot beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of generating an organized atrial contraction, the atria instead fibrillates, or jiggles like a bowl of jelly. The numerous electrical signals that are generated bombard the AV node and it tries to respond but passes on only some of the hundreds of signals that it receives each minute to the ventricle. This leads to the ventricle beating rapidly and irregularly which is termed ''atrial fibrillation'' (A Fib).''Atrial flutter'' (AFL) describes a situation where there is an electrical short circuit in the atrium and a loop of cells generates a rapid regular atrial rhythm of about 300 to 400 cycles per minute. The AV node receives these many signals and tries to protect the ventricle from the barrage and passes on only every second, third, or fourth impulse. Often a patient in atrial flutter will have an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute but a ventricular rate of only 150 beats per minute. This rate is still fast enough for the patient to experience palpitations.''Even though ''atrial fibrillation'' and atrial flutter are relatively safe rhythms, there are complications that may result. When the atrium jiggles and does not contract, there is a potential for blood in the crevices of the atrial walls to become stagnant and form small clots (thrombus). There is a potential that a clot may break away and travel (embolize) to small arteries in the body, blocking circulation and oxygen delivery. In this way, atrial ''fibrillation'' is one of the risk factors for ''stroke'"" and other vascular problems. Atrial fibrillation may also affect the heart's efficiency. Without the kick provided by a coordinated atrial beat, blood delivery to the ventricle is decreased and cardiac output -- the amount of blood circulated to the body with each heartbeat -- falls.""'Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation''As opposed to rapid atrial rhythms, it is potentially life-threatening situation when the ventricle beats too quickly. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs when the ventricular electrical system starts firing on its own without input from the SA or AV node. Depending upon the situation, ventricular tachycardia may or may not beat in an organized way and generate a heartbeat.''Ventricular fibrillation (V Fib) is not compatible with life since the chaotic electrical signals do not generate a coordinated heartbeat. The ventricle jiggles and blood is not pumped to the body. Ventricular fibrillation is the rhythm commonly associated with ''sudden cardiac death''.''Both ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are seen as complications of ischemic ''heart disease'', especially after a ''heart attack'', where the ventricular heart muscle is irritated because of lack of blood supply.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of palpitations?,"'Palpitations describe an irregularity of the heartbeat as felt by the patient. They may be felt as an isolated skipped beat or they may be frequent and recurrent. Palpitations may also be rapid and either regular or irregular. This may lead to the patient describing a fluttering in their chest.''Patients may also complain of fullness in their chest or throat. There may also be associated ''shortness of breath'', ''nausea'', and ''sweating'"". If the heart rate is very fast, the patient's ""'blood pressure'' may fall causing ''lightheadedness'' and the sensation that they might faint or pass-out. ''Syncope'', where the patient actually does faint or pass out, may occur depending upon the cause of palpitations.'  "
How do medical professionals diagnose palpitations?,"'Palpitations may be difficult to diagnose, since often the symptoms are intermittent and may not be present when the patient presents for care.''As with most medical conditions, the key to making the diagnosis lies in the history and physical examination. The health care professional may ask questions to understand the sensation felt by the patient:''Physical examination will often concentrate on the heart and lungs, but may also focus on other organ systems if it is appropriate.''Blood tests may be helpful to look for underlying medical conditions that may cause palpitations. These may include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') or hemogram looking for ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count''), ''electrolytes'', kidney, and thyroid function.''Often the patient does not present when the palpitations are present but an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') may still be helpful in looking for indirect evidence as to the potential cause. A heart monitor may be useful because some patients are unaware that they have PACs or PVCs and this may help make the diagnosis.''It may be frustrating for the patient to make an appointment with his or her doctor or go to an emergency department complaining of palpitations, only to find that they have stopped by the time they are evaluated. Unless there is concern about a life-threatening situation, most patients with palpitations are evaluated as outpatients. A variety of heart monitors can be worn for days or months at a time that can record and even notify the health-care professional if a significant heart rhythm abnormality is detected.''In certain circumstances, the heart rhythm might be evaluated by electrophysiological studies, where the electrical system of the heart is mapped out. The process is similar to a heart catheterization, but the catheter enters a vein instead of an artery. The long catheter and electrode is guided into the heart and used to evaluate the electrical pathways inside the heart muscle. In addition to being diagnostic, sometimes short circuits may be found and treated by ablation or destroying the abnormal circuit. ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'' is often treated in this way.' Are the palpitations an isolated extra or skipped beat or are there runs that can last for minutes or hours? What makes them come on? What makes them go away? What other symptoms might be present, including shortness of breath, chest pain, sweating, nausea and vomiting, lightheadedness, and syncope? Past medical history is important, including a history of heart or lung disease and prescribed medications. Knowing whether other medications or drugs are being used will be helpful. These include caffeine, over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, alcohol, and illegal drugs that may affect the heart (for example, cocaine, amphetamines, and others)."
What is the treatment for palpitations?,"'It is a medical emergency if palpitations are associated with ''chest pain'' (including ''jaw pain'', ''indigestion'' or extreme ''fatigue''), shortness of breath, or syncope (passing out). It is important to activate the emergency response system (call 9-1-1) and seek medical care immediately.'""Palpitations are treated depending upon the underlying cause of the abnormal heart rhythm, and is tailored to the specific patient's needs.""'Many causes of palpitations are self-limiting and lifestyle changes may help decrease their occurrence. These include deceasing or avoiding the use of caffeine, alcohol, and over-the-counter cold medications. As well, many herbal medications contain ''stimulants'"" that may affect the heart's electrical conducting system. ""'Smoking cessation'' is always appropriate.''Depending upon the underlying cause of palpitations, medications may be prescribed to control the heart rate and rhythm. Other treatments may involve ablation or surgical techniques to remove the underlying cause of certain palpitations.''Pacemakers and defibrillators may be indicated if life-threatening conditions are the cause of palpitations.'  "
What is the prognosis for palpitations?,"'Many palpitations are temporary only and are caused by situations that can be resolved by lifestyle modifications. For example, premature atrial contractions and ''premature ventricular contractions'' are variations of normal and do not affect life expectancy but may be prevented by decreasing the intake of stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. These palpitations usually have a good prognosis.'""Other causes of palpitations may require medications or surgery to control the heart rhythm disturbance. The goal is to return the patient to their previous level of health and activity, minimizing restrictions on their daily lives. These palpitations have a prognosis from good to fair and occasionally poor, depending on the individual's response to treatment."" "
Is it possible to prevent palpitations?,"'Some causes of palpitations, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may be due to underlying ''heart disease'', especially ischemic ''heart disease''. Risk factors that can be controlled include lifelong control of ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', and ''diabetes'', plus ''smoking'' cessation.''Some patients with palpitations will benefit from avoiding caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold medications (especially those that contain pseudoephedrine), herbal medications, and other stimulants.' "
Facts you should know about cerebral palsy," Cerebral palsy (CP) is an abnormality of motor function, the ability to move and control movements. Cerebral palsy is acquired at an early age, usually less than a year of age. Cerebral palsy is due to a brain abnormality that does not progress in severity. The causes of cerebral palsy include prematurity, genetic disorders, strokes, and infection of the brain. Taking certain precautions during the pregnancy might decrease the risk of cerebral palsy. Asphyxia, the lack of oxygen to the brain, at birth is not as common a cause of cerebral palsy as had been thought. There are different types of cerebral palsy based on symptoms -- spastic, hypotonic, choreoathetoid, and mixed types. The best approach for diagnosis, treatment, and management is through and interdisciplinary team. Cerebral palsy may be associated with many other medical conditions, including mental retardation or seizures. Many of these conditions can be treated with improved quality of life. Many children with cerebral palsy have a normal intellect and have no seizures. Treatment of cerebral palsy is for the symptoms only; there are few treatments for the underlying causes. There are many alternative medicines promoted for the treatment of cerebral palsy that have never been proven to be helpful. Families and advocates of persons with cerebral palsy should be aware of the lack of scientific basis for these treatments."
What is cerebral palsy?,"'Cerebral palsy (CP) is an abnormality of motor function (as opposed to mental function) and postural tone that is acquired at an early age, even before birth. Signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy usually show in the first year of life.''This abnormality in the motor system is the result of ''brain lesions'' that are nonprogressive. The motor system of the body provides the ability to move and control movements. A brain lesion is any abnormality of brain structure or function. ""Nonprogressive"" means that the lesion does not produce ongoing degeneration of the brain. It is also implied\xa0that the brain lesion is the result of a one-time ''brain injury'', that will not occur again. Whatever the ''brain damage'"" that occurred at the time of the injury is the extent of damage for the rest of the child's life.""'Cerebral palsy affects approximately one to three out of every thousand children born. However, it is much higher in infants born with very low weight and in premature infants.''Interestingly, new treatment methods that resulted in an increased survival rate of low-birth weight and premature infants actually resulted in an overall increase in the number of children with cerebral palsy. The new technologies, however, did not change the rate of cerebral palsy in children born full term and with normal weight.'  "
What are causes of cerebral palsy?,"'The term cerebral palsy does not indicate the cause or prognosis of the child with cerebral palsy. There are many possible causes of cerebral palsy.''In full-term infants the cause of cerebral palsy is usually ''prenatal'"" and not related to events at time of delivery; in most instances it is related to events that happened during the pregnancy while the fetus is developing inside the mother's womb.""'Premature birth is a risk factor for cerebral palsy. The premature brain is at a high risk of bleeding, and when severe enough, it can result in cerebral palsy. Children that are born prematurely can also develop serious respiratory distress due to immature and poorly developed ''lungs'"". This can lead to periods of decreased oxygen delivered to the brain that might result in cerebral palsy. A poorly understood brain process observed in some premature infants is called periventricular leukomalacia. This is a disorder in which holes form in the white matter of the premature infant's brain. The white matter is necessary for the normal processing of signals that are transmitted throughout the brain, and from the brain to the rest of the body. ""'White matter abnormalities are observed in many cases of cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the vast majority of premature infants, even those born very prematurely, do not suffer from cerebral palsy. There have been many advances in the field of neonatology (the care and study of problems affecting ''newborn'' infants) that have enhanced the survival of very premature infants.''Other important causes of cerebral palsy include accidents of brain development, genetic disorders, ''stroke'' due to abnormal blood vessels or ''blood clots'', or infections of the brain.''Even though it is widely believed that the most common cause of cerebral palsy is a lack of oxygen to the brain during delivery (birth asphyxia), it is actually a very rare cause of cerebral palsy. When cerebral palsy is the result of birth asphyxia, the infant almost always suffers severe ''neonatal'' ''encephalopathy'' with symptoms during the first few days of life. These symptoms include:''In rare instances, obstetrical accidents during particularly difficult deliveries can cause brain damage and result in cerebral palsy. Conversely, it is very unlikely that cerebral palsy symptoms would develop after a few years of age as a result of obstetrical complications.''Child abuse'' during infancy can cause significant brain damage which, in turn, can lead to cerebral palsy. This abuse often takes the form of severe shaking from a frustrated parent or ''caregiver'', causing hemorrhage in or just outside the brain. To further compound the problem, many children with developmental abnormalities are at risk for being abused. Thus, a child with cerebral palsy may be made significantly worse or even killed by a single incident of abuse.''Despite the diversity of causes of cerebral palsy, many cases remain without a defined cause. However, the enhanced ability to see the brain structure with ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and ''CT scans'' as well as improved diagnostic capabilities for genetic disorders has made the number of such cases much lower.' seizures, irritability, jitteriness, feeding and respiratory problems, lethargy, and coma depending on the severity."
What are symptoms and signs of cerebral palsy?,"'The predominant symptoms and signs of cerebral palsy are related to motor difficulties, which are the consequence of the brain damage. The extension and severity of the brain lesion is the leading factor in the magnitude of the motor deficit. Many of the symptoms observed in these children are related to the primary problem that is impaired motor functions. For example, developmental motor delay, gait disorders, poor fine and gross motor coordination, swallowing disorders, or speech delay are all the result of the basic motor disorder. The way they present varies from child to child. For that reason, it is difficult to describe a clinical picture that will satisfy every child with cerebral palsy. The clinical presentation, even though with many common features, is very much unique for a particular child. In addition, the comorbid conditions add more to the uniqueness of the presentation of the child with cerebral palsy. For example, some children may be blind, while others may have normal vision; or some children may have severe cognitive delay while others may have normal or near normal cognitive level.'  "
What are the types of cerebral palsy?,"'Based upon the form of motor impairment, cerebral palsy can be divided into types:''These categories are not rigid, and the majority of patients most probably have a mixture of them.' spastic cerebral palsy, dyskinetic cerebral palsy (according to the predominant symptoms dyskinetic CP may be either dystonic or choreoathetotic), which includes ataxic cerebral palsy, and hypotonic cerebral palsy."
What is spastic cerebral palsy?,"'Spastic cerebral palsy refers to a condition in which the muscle tone is increased, causing a rigid posture in one or more extremities (arm(s) or leg(s)). This rigidity can be overcome with some force, ultimately giving way completely and suddenly -- very much like the familiar jackknife (or clasp knife). The ''spasticity'' leads to a limitation of use of the involved extremity, largely due to the inability to coordinate movements. Often the spasticity occurs on one side of the body (hemiparesis), but it can also affect the four limbs (quadriparesis) or be limited to both legs (spastic diplegia). When the condition occurs in both legs, the individual often has a scissoring posture, in which the legs are extended (straightened) and crossed.''Besides the increased muscle tone there is also increased deep tendon reflexes, impaired fine and gross motor coordination, muscle ''weakness'', and fatigability among other problems.''Spasticity is often the result of damage to the white matter of the brain, but it can also be due to damage of ''gray matter''.''The degree of spasticity can vary, ranging from mild to severe. Children who are mildly affected may experience few limitations of their function while severely affected children may have little to no meaningful use of the affected limb(s). Spasticity, if not properly treated, can result in contractures, which are permanent limitations in the ability of joint movement. Contractures can be greatly limiting in the care of children with cerebral palsy. Spasticity can also be quite painful, requiring medication to relax the muscle tone.''The same fundamental processes that influence spasticity of the limbs can also result in abnormalities of movement and muscle tone in other body systems. In the muscles of the head and face, for example, cerebral palsy can greatly limit the coordination and production of speech, even when the child is perfectly capable of understanding speech. There can also be limitations of chewing, swallowing, and facial and eye movements. These symptoms can be particularly troubling for afflicted children and their families.''Many patients with spastic cerebral palsy cannot control their output of urine. This inability is not necessarily due to problems in thinking but is caused by heightened reflexes of the bladder. When the bladder fills in these children, it is just like tapping on it with a reflex hammer, thus making it contract more vigorously than normal and causing a spilling of urine. This ''incontinence'' can be quite embarrassing, especially in a cognitively intact child.' "
What is dyskinetic cerebral palsy?,"'In the dyskinetic form of cerebral palsy the predominant feature is the presence of involuntary abnormal movements in the arms, legs, face, and trunk. ' "
What is ataxic cerebral palsy?,"'\tAtaxic CP is a rare form of\xa0CP. It is a dyskinetic form of CP; that is, abnormal movements are present. In these children there is a marked loss of orderly muscular coordination so that movements are performed with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. The fine motor coordination is much affected, as well as the gait.' "
What is dystonic cerebral palsy?,'Dystonic CP is characterized by predominance of slow movements with muscle rigidity and persistent abnormal postures that relax after seconds or minutes. The frequency of these abnormal involuntary movements is less than in the choreoathetotic form. Usually the muscle tone is increased.' 
What is choreoathetoid cerebral palsy?,"'Choreoathetoid (sometimes referred as athetoid) cerebral palsy is associated with abnormal, uncontrollable, writhing movements of the arms and/or legs. Different from spastic cerebral palsy, persons with choreoathetoid cerebral palsy have variable muscle tone often with decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Contractures of extremities are less common. The abnormal movements are activated by ''stress'', as well as by normal emotional reactions such as laughing. Any attempt to do voluntary movements, for example extending the arm in an attempt to reach an object, might result in many involuntary movements in arms, legs, trunk, and even the face. There are different types of abnormal movements. Two of the most common are choreoathetotic movement disorder with rapid, irregular, unpredictable contractions of individual or small muscles groups and ''dystonia'' with a persistent but not permanent, abnormal posture of some body parts (arms, legs, trunk) due to abnormal muscle contractions. The dystonic disorder also affects the muscles for facial expression, swallowing, deglutition, and speech, resulting in severe functional deficiencies.'""These movements can be quite debilitating and greatly limit the child's ability to perform many motor tasks. Furthermore, the movements are akin to constant ""'exercise'', thereby causing the affected child to metabolize a huge number of calories. Choreoathetoid cerebral palsy is often associated with damage to specialized brain structures that are involved in movement control -- the basal ganglia. Like spastic cerebral palsy, the degree of symptom severity often varies, from mild to severely affected.' "
What is hypotonic cerebral palsy?,"'Hypotonia is diminished muscle tone. The infant or child with hypotonic cerebral palsy appears floppy -- like a rag doll. In early infancy, hypotonia can be easily seen by the inability of the infant to gain any head control when pulled by the arms to a sitting position (this symptom is often referred to as head lag). Children with severe hypotonia may have the most difficulty of all children with cerebral palsy in attaining motor skill milestones and normal cognitive development.''Hypotonic cerebral palsy is often the result of severe brain damage or malformations. It is believed that hypotonic cerebral palsy is the result of an injury or malformation at an earlier brain developmental stage than that which causes spastic or choreoathetoid cerebral palsy.''Hypotonia in infancy is a common finding in many neurological conditions, ranging from very mild abnormalities to severe or even fatal neurodegenerative or muscle disorders. It is important to note that many children with spastic cerebral palsy go through a short stage of being somewhat hypotonic in early life, before presenting the full syndrome. ' "
What is mixed cerebral palsy?,"'Many (possibly most) children with cerebral palsy have multiple symptoms with combinations of the various forms of cerebral palsy. For example, children with spastic cerebral palsy often continue to have a head lag, which is representative of hypotonia. Children with choreoathetoid or hypotonic cerebral palsy often have increased deep tendon reflexes, which are suggestive of some spasticity. Children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy may also have dystonic movements in the limbs affected. The different types of cerebral palsy described above are rarely seen as pure clinical forms, more often the child with cerebral palsy has a mixture of signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, in clinical practice the type of cerebral palsy is defined on the basis of the predominant manifestations.' "
What other conditions are associated with cerebral palsy?,"'Since cerebral palsy is indicative of damage to or malformation of the brain, it stands to reason that other symptoms that are associated with brain dysfunction can be present in children afflicted with cerebral palsy. In fact, other disorders, besides the motor dysfunctions already described, are almost always seen in these patients. Some of them such as poor speech, swallowing disorders, ''drooling'', and poor fine or gross motor coordination are the result of the motor disorder affecting specific muscles involved in those functions. Other conditions are the results of simultaneous injuries in areas of the brain besides the motor areas.''Cognitive disabilities, sometimes referred to as developmental delay, are often associated with cerebral palsy. Up to half of patients with cerebral palsy have cognitive disabilities. However, many of these children can be educated and lead productive lives. It is also just as important to note that many children with severe motor impairment due to cerebral palsy, as is the case with many children with the choreoathetotic or the diplegic form of cerebral palsy, are only mildly or not at all intellectually impaired.'""Virtually all testing of a young child's cognitive development involves some sort of motor activity on the part of the child. If a child is capable of complex thoughts, but incapable of motor activity, the observer will not be able to detect his or her mental aptitude. Therefore, one must be very careful in assigning labels to patients with cerebral palsy. Certain features, however, are more likely to be associated with significant cognitive disabilities in the patient with cerebral palsy. These include extensive damage occurring on both sides of the brain, children with spastic quadriplegia, ""'microcephaly'' (''small head'' size), a documented ''genetic disorder'', and a documented prenatal infection.''Seizures are a common finding in patients with cerebral palsy. Perhaps a third of all cerebral palsy patients have seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity of the neurons in the brain. The damaged or malformed brain is more prone to seizures. Moreover, cognitive disability is frequently associated with epileptic seizures.''The ''symptoms of seizures'' can vary depending on where in the brain they originate. Generalized seizures engage the entire cerebral cortex at once, while partial seizures only involve part of the cerebral cortex. Often, generalized seizures begin as partial seizures but spread throughout the brain rapidly. Generalized seizures may take the form of true convulsions (""''grand mal''""), in which the entire body jerks in a rhythmic fashion, or the form of absences (""petit mal""), which interrupt the patient\'s activities for a brief period, but does not cause a fall.''Other forms of generalized seizures can occur in the cerebral palsy patient. Atonic seizures cause the patient to slump suddenly to the ground or forward in their chair, resembling a marionette in which the puppeteer suddenly cut the strings. Tonic seizures are just the opposite and cause the entire body to suddenly stiffen. Both tonic and atonic seizures can result in drop attacks in which the patient falls to the ground, often resulting in injury.''Partial seizures may involve the jerking of the arm and leg on the same side of the body. Alternatively, they may be associated with strange sensory phenomena, such as flashing lights, or emotions, such as fear, depending on where in the brain the ''seizure'' occurs.''Vision deficiencies are frequently seen. Some of them, for example, ''strabismus'' (""lazy eyes"") can be corrected by surgical procedures in the muscles of the eyes. Some can be corrected with eye glasses (that may be difficult to implement in non-cooperative children). In other children, the visual deficiencies are the result of brain injuries to the areas of the brain that are associated with vision, rendering the child blind (""cortical ''blindness''"") even if the eyes themselves are perfectly normal. At the present time, there is no treatment to improve this condition.''Children with cerebral palsy can have speech disorders of many types. Some, like poor word pronunciation (''dysarthria''), are the result of impairment of the peripheral mechanism of speech (poor lips, tongue, or palate coordination). In another circumstance, there is brain injury in the gray matter of the brain that controls the central mechanism of speech (''aphasia'').''It is difficult for children with cerebral palsy to gain weight and they frequently have delayed growth. This is the result of several factors including feeding disorders, gastroesophageal reflux, and in some instances, for example, children with choreoathetotic disorders, excessive caloric consumption. On the other, hand ''obesity'' could be a problem in those children with cerebral palsy that have limited mobility.''Individuals with the choreoathetotic form of cerebral palsy might have compressed nerves or damage to the neck bones that can lead to damage to the spinal cord.''Other issues to be aware of are dental diseases, respiratory problems, ''urinary tract infections'', ''osteoporosis'' and subsequent ''fractures'', ''enuresis'', ''encopresis'', and ''constipation''.'  "
How is a child evaluated for cerebral palsy?,"""Most of the information leading to the diagnosis of cerebral palsy is generally obtained from a thorough medical history and examination. The most critical tasks of the health care professional are to identify potentially treatable causes of a child's impairment. The health care professional evaluating the child with possible cerebral palsy should be experienced in neurological examination and assessment of impaired children and well-""'versed'' in the potential causes of cerebral palsy. Often, but not necessarily, this practitioner should be a pediatric ''neurologist''. Once the examination is complete, depending on the findings, the practitioner may order laboratory tests to help in the assessment.''There is no single test to diagnose cerebral palsy. But since cerebral palsy is the result of multiple different causes, the tests performed are used to identify specific causes when possible. Other tests will be performed to assess the condition of the child (nutritional status for example) or to assess other concomitant conditions that the child might have.''Blood and urine tests may be used to identify some of the more common inborn errors of metabolism. Blood tests may also be used for chromosomal or other genetic studies. Brain imaging studies can also be used to detect structural changes in the brain. The most sensitive brain imaging study is the MRI examination. Nuclear medicine neuroimaging studies such as SPECT or PET have no place in the initial evaluation of a child with cerebral palsy, but may prove very useful in the assessment of selected candidates.''Despite all of these tests, it may not be possible to answer some of the burning questions in the mind of a parent of a neurologically impaired infant, such as ""Why does my child have cerebral palsy?"" or ""Will my child be normal?"" This is particularly true if a specific diagnosis is not reached and the child is under one year of age. Some severely impaired young infants can grow up to be independent, productive members of society, while other children, seemingly less impaired, may require care throughout their lives.''Once the diagnostic evaluation is complete, further testing may be needed in order to define the specific needs of any individual child. For example, if seizures are present or suspected, an ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') is performed. However, this test is not needed if there are no signs of ''epilepsy''.' "
What are treatment options for cerebral palsy?,"'Most of the causes of cerebral palsy do not have specific, curative treatments. However, children with cerebral palsy present many medical problems that can be treated or prevented. The initial stage of treatment involves an interdisciplinary team, consisting of a pediatrician, preferable one with experience in neurodevelopmental disorders, a neurologist (or other neurological practitioner), a ''mental health'' practitioner, an orthopedic surgeon, a physical therapist, a speech therapist, and an occupational therapist. Each member of the team has important, independent contributions to make in the care of the affected child.''Most children with neurological impairment have significant emotional distress and also require therapy from a mental health practitioner.''Virtually all states have federally-mandated programs for the assessment and treatment of children with cerebral palsy and other developmental conditions. In many states, these programs are termed ""Regional Centers"" and can be found in local phone books. Also Children\'s Hospitals usually have special clinics with experience with children with cerebral palsy. Furthermore, when a child reaches the age of 3 years, the school district may become formally involved in the review of at-risk children. These programs protect children up to the age of 21 years.''At the present time, there is a vacuum in the provision of medical care for adults (young and old) with cerebral palsy living in the community settings. There are a limited number of services in adult hospitals geared to the treatment of adults with cerebral palsy or developmental disabilities.'  The physical therapist evaluates muscle tone, strength, and gait (walking). The occupational therapist reviews the child's ability to perform tasks of self-help and care -- from feeding to manual dexterity. The speech therapist evaluates the child's ability to speak and understand speech."
What are specific treatment plans for cerebral palsy?,"'After the initial evaluation, specific treatment plans are outlined for each child:''If the child has seizures, the treatment is based on the type and frequency of the seizures. Complete ''seizure'' control can often be achieved using a single medication, but some children with cerebral palsy have particularly difficult-to-control seizures. Medication can have side effects affecting the brain, ranging from sedation to ''hyperactivity''. They can also affect ''liver function'', white and ''red blood cells'', and bone metabolism. Side effects are usually not harmful and resolve when the offending medication is discontinued. The goal of the treating physician should be for the child to become seizure free with few or no side effects. It must be noted that it is of no benefit to the child to be seizure-free but significantly impaired by medication side effects.''Medications for spasticity:'' The treatment of spasticity can involve multiple health professionals. Treatments involve the use of medications and surgical procedures to decrease the spasticity, facilitate movement, and prevent contractions. Among the most common medications are ''dantrolene'' sodium (''Dantrium'') and ''diazepam'' (''Valium''). Diazepam is both a muscle relaxant and a sedative. ''Baclofen'' (''Lioresal'') can be taken by mouth or infused continuously with an implanted pump (intrathecal infusion) directly in the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid that bathe the spinal cord and the brain). This treatment might be specifically useful for patients with spasticity in the lower legs. The most common complications with these medications are drowsiness, sleepiness, and some degree of weakness. The sedative side effects of such medications often limit their usefulness. In the case of the baclofen pump, the most common complication seen in a small number of patients is the infection of the catheter. Additionally, a muscle relaxing agent called botulinum toxin can be injected into tight muscles to relax them. When used prudently, this procedure may prevent surgical intervention.''Surgery for spasticity:'' In the case of severe muscle spasticity, surgery may be a valuable option. Tendon release procedures, usually performed by an orthopedic surgeon, allow improved range of motion in some cases. Such procedures are usually performed on the muscles of the calf or inner thigh. A less commonly used procedure, is the dorsal rhizotomy. During this operation, the surgeon ''cuts'' some of the nerve roots that send sensory information from the muscles to the spinal cord and brain. This procedure relieves some of the spasticity and thereby helps the child walk with a more normal gait. Most neurosurgeons performing dorsal rhizotomies very carefully select only those patients whom they feel may be helped by the surgery. From time to time, other surgical interventions are required in children with cerebral palsy. In very rare cases of choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, in which the writhing movements severely limit the ability of the child to function, highly selective neurosurgical techniques can curtail these movements without significantly harming other functions.''Ophthalmologists'' (eye specialists) can help ''strabismus'' by operating on the muscles that control the movement of the eye or to correct some other complications such as ''cataracts''.''Neurosurgeons'' can treat intractable seizure control. Operations such as callosotomy, hemispherectomy, and focal resections of areas of abnormal brain tissue responsible for the seizures, might be indicated in some cases. An alternative procedure for the treatment of ''epilepsy'' is the vagal nerve stimulation, an implantable device, that can be useful in selected patients with difficult to control seizures.''Scoliosis'', or curvature of the spine, is often the result of severe hypotonia. This condition can create discomfort for the patient and difficulty for caregivers in performing the activities of daily living. Furthermore, severe ''scoliosis'"" may actually restrict a patient's ability to breathe. Several surgical procedures are available in specialized centers for the correction of scoliosis.""'Children who are unable to take adequate calories by mouth may require the placement of a feeding gastrostomy tube (''PEG'' tubes) directly into the stomach.''The treatment of spasticity can involve multiple allied health care professionals. Physical and occupational therapists play an important role.''Physical therapy:'' The extent of physical therapy depends on the degree of spasticity, hypotonia, and motor impairment. The main therapeutic effect of physical therapy is maintaining range of motion at the joints, thereby preventing contractures. Some scientists and therapists feel that physical therapy actually helps maintain the connections in the brain, although this is controversial. Other skills, such as improved gait, stance, and balance can be helped by physical therapy. A strong, proactive physical therapy program greatly aids in the life of a child with cerebral palsy.''Occupational therapy:'' Occupational therapy assists children with the skills needed for day-to-day life in school and at home, including eating, writing, and work skills. In early infancy, occupational therapists can provide assistance in feeding a child with a poor or uncoordinated sucking response.''Speech therapy:'' Speech and language pathologists are involved with the development and improvement of speech production. Using different techniques, the speech pathologist helps to improve the quality and the quantity of the speech production. The role of these specialists is not limited to speech production alone, but they also teach the patients other communication techniques (''sign language'', use of communication boards) to facilitate the communication abilities.''Medical care of children with cerebral palsy is often seriously hampered by the inability of the child to communicate his or her needs and sensations. Relatively common ''childhood illnesses'' in children with cerebral palsy, such as ''ear infections'', ''urinary tract infections'', and ''appendicitis'', which are easily treatable in most children, may prove to be life-threatening due to delayed recognition on the part of caregivers and physicians. Each child with cerebral palsy should have a primary care professional that is experienced with the special medical needs of affected children.''Because physicians have offered limited hope in curing cerebral palsy, many families have turned to alternative methods in the treatment of their children. Such therapies may include diets, herbal remedies, aromas, play with animals, and hyperbaric oxygen. The scientific evidence supporting the use of diets is inadequate. Some of them such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is delivered in specialized centers, can be quite expensive and has not been scientifically proven to help children with cerebral palsy. Other remedies must be investigated on a case-by-case basis. Hopefully, the family of the affected child will be able to approach their physician regarding these alternative treatments.' "
What is the long-term outlook for patients with cerebral palsy?,"'The answer is complex. Since cerebral palsy is actually a set of symptoms associated with a variety of causes, potential treatments will have to be diverse. Many scientists are now focusing on recent discoveries that suggest we will be able to replace lost or damaged brain cells. While such therapies are not yet available, it is likely that real ''clinical trials'' will begin in the next 5 to 10 years.''The more we know about the causes of cerebral palsy, the more we can do to prevent it. For example, the use of ''folic acid'' in sexually active women may prevent central nervous system malformations that might lead to cerebral palsy. Avoiding the use of certain ''drugs'' during the pregnancy whether legal, such as prescribed medications, ''alcohol'' or tobacco, or illegal such as ''cocaine'' and ''crack'', will also decrease the changes of cerebral palsy in a child.'""It cannot be overemphasized that the most important person in the lives of children with cerebral palsy is their caregiver. The caregiver, whether a parent or other person, must be able to recognize a child's needs and provide for him or her in a loving, positive environment. Because of the difficulty that many children with cerebral palsy have in expressing their needs, they are at great risk for unintentional and intentional neglect as well as overt child abuse. Often, the care of children with cerebral palsy can be quite taxing emotionally and financially on the family. The appropriate care for children with cerebral palsy, therefore, must take into account mental health and financial support for families and caregivers. Many state-run programs provide out-of-home schooling as well as respite care for the caregivers, but these services often fall short of what is truly needed. Health care professionals can very simply improve the lives of their patients by taking some extra time to listen to the concerns and hopes of the caregivers and provide thoughtful answers to their questions.""'We must recognize that many, and possibly most, children with cerebral palsy can lead full, meaningful, and happy lives. The team of parents, caregivers, and health practitioners has the responsibility to help the child with cerebral palsy achieve this goal.' "
Facts you should know about polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),"   Polyarteritis nodosa is an autoimmune disease that affects arteries. Common areas affected include the muscles, joints, intestines (bowels), nerves, kidneys, and skin. Diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed by a biopsy of involved tissue or angiography. Treatment is directed toward decreasing the inflammation of the arteries."
What is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare autoimmune disease featuring spontaneous inflammation of the arteries (arteritis, a form of blood vessel inflammation or ""''vasculitis''""). Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an overactive, misdirected immune system that attacks one\'s own body. Because arteries are involved, the disease can affect any organ of the body. The most common areas of involvement include the muscles, joints, intestines (bowels), nerves, kidneys, and skin. Poor function or ''pain'' in any of these organs can be a symptom. Poor blood supply to the bowels can cause ''abdominal pain'', local bowel death, and bleeding. ''Fatigue'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever'' are common. Polyarteritis nodosa is often abbreviated PAN.' "
What are causes and risk factors for polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa is most common in middle-age people. Its cause is unknown, but it has been reported after ''hepatitis B'' infection. Polyarteritis is not felt to be an ''inherited'' condition.' "
What are symptoms and signs of polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa causes symptoms and signs that are a result of injury to the blood vessels. Therefore, the symptoms and signs depend on which vessels are affected and to what degree. This can lead to organ damage or injury. For example, if blood vessels supplying the nerves or muscles are affected, the nerves or muscles can be damaged. If the blood vessels to the kidneys are affected, kidney damage with ''blood in the urine'' can result. Symptoms and signs can include ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''high blood pressure'', ''muscle pain'' (''myalgia''), ''joint pain'' (''arthralgia''), ''testicular pain'', livido reticularis, nerve damage, and ''abdominal pain''.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose polyarteritis nodosa?,"'The diagnosis is supported by tests that indicate inflammation including elevation of blood ''sedimentation rate'' and ''C-reactive protein''. The white blood cell count and ''platelet count'' can be elevated, while the red blood count is decreased (''anemia''). ''Hepatitis B'' virus (testing for either antigen or antibody) can be found in 10%-20% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa. Urine testing can show protein and ''red blood cells'' in the urine. In patients with nerves affected, nerve conduction tests are abnormal.''The diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed by a biopsy of involved tissue that reveals the inflamed blood vessels (''vasculitis''). Examples of tissues that are sometimes biopsied include nerves, muscle, kidneys, and bowel. Vasculitis of the bowel and kidneys can often be detected with an ''angiogram'' (X-ray testing while contrast ""dye"" is infused into the blood vessels).''The American College of ''Rheumatology'' established criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa in 1990. For classification purposes (to group patients together for medical studies), a patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if at least three of the following 10 criteria are present:' Weight loss greater than/equal to 4 kg Livedo reticularis (a mottled purplish skin discoloration over the extremities or torso) Testicular pain or tenderness (occasionally, a site biopsied for diagnosis) Muscle pain, weakness, or leg tenderness Nerve disease (either single or multiple) Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg (high blood pressure) Elevated kidney blood tests (BUN greater than 40 mg/dl or creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl) Hepatitis B virus tests positive (for surface antigen or antibody) Arteriogram (angiogram) showing the arteries that are dilated (aneurysms) or constricted by the blood vessel inflammation Biopsy of tissue showing the arteritis (typically inflamed arteries)"
What is the treatment for polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis is a serious illness that can be fatal. Treatment is directed toward decreasing the inflammation of the arteries by suppressing the immune system. Medications used to treat polyarteritis nodosa include high-dose intravenous and oral cortisone medications such as ''prednisone'', as well as immunosuppressive ''drugs'' such as ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran).''When ''hepatitis'' B is present in patients with polyarteritis, antiviral medications (such as vidarabine and ''interferon''-alpha) are used as primary treatments. Treatments have included various combinations of antiviral medications, plasma exchange, and immunosuppressive drugs.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) of polyarteritis nodosa?,"'The outlook for patients with polyarteritis nodosa depends on the degree of damage to affected organs and the response to treatments. For those patients with underlying ''hepatitis'' B infection, eradication of the virus is essential for optimal outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent polyarteritis nodosa?,'The only ''prevention'' for polyarteritis nodosa is to avoid the risk of hepatitis B.' 
What is pancreas divisum?," Pancreas divisum is a common congenital anomaly (an anomaly that is present at birth) of the pancreatic duct(s). The pancreas is a deep-seated organ located behind the stomach. One of its functions is to produce enzymes that are important for the digestion of food in the intestine. The digestive enzymes, in the form of digestive juice, drain from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct into the duodenum (the uppermost portion of the small intestine) where they aid in digesting food."
What causes pancreas divisum?,"'The human embryo starts life with a pancreas that is in two parts, each with its own duct; the ventral duct and the dorsal duct. The two parts of the pancreas fuse during development. In most embryos, the dorsal and the ventral ducts also will fuse to form one main pancreatic duct. The main pancreatic duct will join the common bile duct (the duct that drains bile from the gallbladder and the ''liver'') to form a common bile and pancreatic duct which drains into the duodenum through the major papilla.''In some embryos, the dorsal and the ventral ducts fail to fuse. Failure of the ventral and the dorsal pancreatic ducts to fuse is called pancreas divisum (because the pancreas is drained by two ducts). In pancreas divisum, the ventral duct drains into the major papilla, while the dorsal duct drains into a separate minor papilla.' "
What are pancreas divisum symptoms?,"'Most individuals born with pancreas divisum experience no symptoms throughout life, will remain undiagnosed, and will not require treatment. A small number of patients with pancreas divisum will experience repeated episodes of ''pancreatitis''. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that can cause ''abdominal pain'' as well as more severe complications. Some patients with pancreas divisum may develop chronic ''abdominal pain'' without pancreatitis.''Doctors are not certain how pancreas divisum causes ''abdominal pain'' and pancreatitis. One theory is that the minor papilla is too narrow to adequately drain the digestive juices in the dorsal portion of the pancreas. The backup of the digestive juices elevates the pressure in the minor duct that causes abdominal ''pain'' and pancreatitis. Others believe that there must be other factors above and beyond the anatomic anomaly of pancreas divisum that predispose a certain population of patients to develop pancreatitis. Research continues in order to determine the exact relationship.'  "
How is pancreas divisum diagnosed?,"'\tThe most accurate test to diagnose pancreas divisum is ''ERCP'' (''endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography''), which can demonstrate the presence of two separately draining pancreatic ducts. However, ERCP itself sometimes can cause attacks of pancreatitis. Other tests that can help diagnose pancreas divisum without the risk of causing pancreatitis include ''endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS), and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').' "
What is the treatment for pancreas divisum?,"'\tPancreas divisum without symptoms needs no treatment. Treatment of patients with abdominal ''pain'' and recurrent pancreatitis attributable to pancreas divisum has not been well established. Some doctors will attempt sphincterotomy (cutting of the minor papilla during ERCP to enlarge its opening). Others will insert a ''stent'' during ERCP into the duct to prevent duct blockage. These procedures are not risk free. Therefore, patients with symptomatic pancreas divisum are best evaluated and treated by doctors in centers experienced in treating pancreatic diseases.'  "
What is the prognosis for pancreas divisum?,"'\tMost patients with pancreas divisum remain asymptomatic and therefore the prognosis is excellent. For those patients with symptoms of pancreatitis, the prognosis is no different than that of the unaffected population who develop pancreatitis. Even after treatment, pancreatitis may recur. It is important to remember that there is no clear evidence to support a causal relationship between pancreas divisum and pancreatitis.' "
What should I know about pancreatitis?,"'What is the medical definition of pancreatitis?''How do I know if I have pancreatitis?''How to test for pancreatitis''How to treat pancreatitis''What are the complications of pancreatitis?''What is the pancreatitis prognosis?' Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Of the many causes of pancreatitis, the most common are alcohol consumption and gallstones. About 210,000 cases of acute pancreatitis occur in the U.S. every year. Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain that may radiate to the back Pain that worsens after eating Chills and fever Tenderness of the abdomen to touch Lethargy and weakness Diagnosis of pancreatitis is generally with blood and imaging tests. Most cases of acute pancreatitis require hospitalization; however, treatment of chronic pancreatitis may be managed in an outpatient setting. Diabetes Pancreatic cancer Malnutrition Infection Pseudocyst formation Pancreatitis can range from a mild, self-limited disease to a condition with life-threatening complications."
What is pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas.''Pancreatitis is categorized as being either acute or chronic.''Pancreatitis is a condition that may be mild and self-limiting, though it can also lead to severe complications that can be life-threatening. The acute form of pancreatitis, in its most severe form, can have deleterious effects on many other body organs, including the ''lungs'' and kidneys.' The pancreas is an abdominal gland situated behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. The main function of the pancreas is to secrete hormones and enzymes that help with digestion and regulate blood sugar (glucose) metabolism. The digestive enzymes are released via the pancreatic duct into the small intestine where they are activated to help break down fats and proteins. The digestive hormones (insulin and glucagon) produced by the pancreas are released into the blood stream where they help regulate blood sugar levels. Acute pancreatitis generally develops suddenly, and it is usually a short-term (a few days to weeks) illness that typically resolves with appropriate medical management. Chronic pancreatitis, which typically develops after multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis, is a long-term condition that can last for months or even several years."
What are the signs and symptoms of pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis causes upper ''abdominal pain'' which can range from mild to severe.''The ''pain'' may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually. Often, the pain will start or worsen after eating, which can also occur with gallbladder or ulcer pain. ''Abdominal pain'' tends to be the hallmark of acute pancreatitis. People with acute pancreatitis usually feel very ill.''Acute pancreatitis signs and symptoms may include:''In chronic pancreatitis, abdominal pain also can be present, but it is often not as severe, and some people may not have any pain at all.''Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms may include:'   Abdominal pain that may radiate to the back Nausea and vomiting Worsening pain after eating Tenderness to touch of the abdomen Fever and chills Weakness and lethargy Abdominal pain Unintentional weight loss Foul smelling, oily stool"
10 Causes of pancreatitis?,"'Normally, digestive enzymes released by the pancreas are not activated to break down fats and proteins until they reach the small intestine. However, when these digestive enzymes are activated while still in the pancreas, inflammation and local damage to the pancreas occurs leading to pancreatitis.''The causes of pancreatitis include:''Alcohol consumption and ''gallstones'' account for over 80% of all cases of pancreatitis in the US.'   Alcohol consumption Gallstones High triglyceride levels Abdominal injury or surgery Certain medications Exposure to certain chemicals Smoking Family history of pancreatitis Cystic fibrosis Pancreatic cancer"
How is pancreatitis diagnosed?,"'There are a number of tests that alone, or in combination, will help establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis.''Amylase and/or lipase levels are typically elevated in cases of acute pancreatitis. These blood tests may not be elevated in cases of chronic pancreatitis. These are usually the first tests performed to establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis, as these results are generally readily and quickly available. Other blood tests may be ordered, for example:''A CT (computed tomography) scan of the abdomen may be ordered to visualize the pancreas and to evaluate the extent of inflammation, as well as any of the potential complications that can arise from pancreatitis, such as bleeding or pseudocyst (a collection of fluid) formation. The ''CT scan'' may also detect gallstones (a major cause of pancreatitis) and other abnormalities of the biliary system.''Ultrasound'' imaging can be used to look for gallstones and abnormalities of the biliary system. Because ultrasound imaging does not emit ''radiation'', this modality is frequently the initial imaging test obtained in cases of pancreatitis.''Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis and the severity of illness, additional testing may be ordered.' Liver and kidney function tests Tests for infection Tests for anemia"
What is the treatment for pancreatitis?,"'In most cases of acute pancreatitis, admission to the hospital is needed, whereas some cases of chronic pancreatitis can be managed in an outpatient setting.''Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis, management may vary to address the specific cause. In general, however, the following treatment regimen will always be initiated for the treatment of pancreatitis.''First-line treatment will involve:''If pancreatitis is due to an obstructing gallstone, surgical intervention may be required to remove the gallstone and/or remove the gallbladder. Intervention may also be required to treat a pseudocyst or to remove part of the affected pancreas.''If alcohol consumption is the cause of pancreatitis, abstinence from alcohol and an alcohol rehabilitation program will be recommended.''If a medication or chemical exposure is found to be the cause of pancreatitis, then removal of the medication or offending exposure is recommended.''If high ''triglycerides'"" are the cause of pancreatitis, then your health-care professional may prescribe medication to decrease the patient's ""'triglyceride levels''.'   Fasting to help the pancreas to rest and recover. IV fluids to prevent dehydration while fasting Pancreatitis can be very painful, thus intravenous pain medication is often necessary."
Medications for pancreatitis,"'In general, the above treatment regimen is the mainstay of pancreatitis management.''Pain medication and medication to control nausea may also be prescribed.''In cases of chronic pancreatitis, your health-care professional also may prescribe pancreatic enzyme ''supplements'' in order to help the body digest certain nutrients.' "
Is there a diet for pancreatitis?,"'For people with pancreatitis, low-fat meals that are high in nutrients is the recommended ''diet''. Adequate fluid intake is also recommended to prevent ''dehydration''.' "
What are some of the complications of pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis can be a life-threatening illness with severe complications. Complications may include:' Diabetes: Damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes due to the disruption in the secretion of insulin. Pseudocyst formation: During acute pancreatitis, fluid and debris can collect in and around the pancreas. If rupture of this fluid-containing sac occurs, severe pain, infection and internal bleeding can result. Malnutrition: Damage to the pancreas can lead to a decrease or absence of digestive enzymes produced, which can affect the absorption of various nutrients. This may lead to malnutrition and unintentional weight loss. Pancreatic cancer: Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. Infection: Individuals with pancreatitis are at risk for the development of infection, which can lead to multi-organ failure, sepsis and ultimately death."
Can pancreatitis be prevented?," Certain lifestyle changes can decrease the chances of someone getting pancreatitis, such as alcohol and smoking cessation. Consuming a low-fat diet and maintaining a healthy weight can decrease the risk of developing gallstones, a leading cause of pancreatitis."
What is the prognosis for pancreatitis?,"""The prognosis for pancreatitis depends on many different factors, such as the underlying condition causing pancreatitis, the severity of the pancreatitis, and the patient's age and underlying medical problems. Patients with pancreatitis can experience everything from a brief self-limited illness with a full recovery to severe course of illness that can lead to life-threatening complications and death. If an individual has repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, they may develop chronic pancreatitis, a lifelong condition that can lead to a decreased quality of life."" "
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.

"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN.

What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.

"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels.

Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.

"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What does a pancreas do?,"'The pancreas is a hormone-producing organ in the abdomen that sits in front of the spine above the level of the ''belly button''. It performs two main functions:''The enzymes help ''digestion'' by chopping proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into smaller parts so that they can be more easily absorbed by the body and used as building blocks for tissues and for energy. Enzymes leave the pancreas via a system of tubes called ""ducts"" that connect the pancreas to the ''intestines'' where the enzymes mix with ingested food.''The pancreas sits deep in the abdomen and is in close proximity to many important structures such as the small intestine (the duodenum) and the bile ducts, as well as important blood vessels and nerves.' first, it makes insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels (an endocrine function); and second, it makes and secretes into the intestine digestive enzymes which help break down dietary proteins, fats, and carbohydrates (an exocrine function)."
What is cancer?,"'Every second of every day within our body, a massive process of destruction and repair occurs. The ''human body'"" is made up of trillions of cells and every day billions of cells wear out or are destroyed. Each time the body makes a new cell to replace one that is wearing out, the body tries to make a perfect copy of the cell that dies off, usually by having similar healthy cells divide into two cells because that dying cell had a job to do, and the newly made cell must be capable of performing that same function. Despite remarkably elegant systems in place to edit out errors in this process, the body makes tens of thousands of mistakes daily in normal cell division either due to random errors or from environmental pressure within the body. Most of these mistakes are corrected, or the mistake leads to the death of the newly made cell, and another new cell then is made. Sometimes a mistake is made that, rather than inhibiting the cell's ability to grow and survive, allows the newly made cell to grow in an unregulated manner. When this occurs, that cell becomes a cancer cell able to divide independent of the checks and balances that control normal cell division. The cancer cell multiplies, and a cancerous or ""'malignant tumor'' develops.''Tumors fall into two categories: ""benign"" tumors and ""''malignant'',"" or cancerous, tumors. What is the difference? The answer is that a benign ''tumor'' grows only in the tissue from which it arises. Benign tumors sometimes can grow quite large or grow rapidly and cause severe symptoms. For example, a ''fibroid'"" in a woman's uterus can cause bleeding or ""'pain'', but it will never travel outside the uterus, invade surrounding tissues or grow as a new tumor elsewhere in the body (metastasized). Fibroids, like all benign tumors, lack the capacity to shed cells into the blood and lymph systems and cannot travel to other places in the body and grow. A cancer, on the other hand, can shed cells from the original tumor that can float like ''dandelion'' seeds in the wind through the bloodstream or lymphatics, landing in tissues distant from the tumor, developing into new tumors in other parts of the body. This process, called ''metastasis'', is the defining characteristic of a cancerous tumor. Pancreatic cancer, unfortunately, is a particularly good model for this process. Pancreatic cancers can ''metastasize'' early to other organs in this manner. They also can grow and invade adjacent structures directly, often rendering the surgical removal of the tumor impossible.''Cancers are named by the tissues from which the ''primary tumor'' arises. Hence, a ''lung cancer'' that travels to the ''liver'' is not a ""''liver cancer''"" but is described as metastatic ''lung cancer'' and a patient with a ''breast cancer'' that spreads to the brain is not described as having a ""''brain tumor''"" but rather as having metastatic ''breast cancer''.' "
What is pancreatic cancer? What are the types of pancreatic cancer?,"'A cancer that develops within the pancreas falls into two major categories: (1) cancers of the endocrine pancreas (the part that makes insulin and other hormones) are called ""islet cell"" or ""''pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors'' or PNETs"" and (2) cancers of the exocrine pancreas (the part that makes enzymes). Islet cell cancers are rare and typically grow slowly compared to exocrine pancreatic cancers. ''Islet cell tumors'' often release hormones into the bloodstream and are further characterized by the hormones they produce (insulin, glucagon, gastrin, and other hormones). Cancers of the exocrine pancreas (exocrine cancers) develop from the cells that line the system of ducts that deliver enzymes to the small intestine and are commonly referred to as pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell pancreatic cancer is rare. ''Adenocarcinoma'' of the pancreas comprises most all pancreatic ductal cancers and is the main subject of this review.''Cells that line the ducts in the exocrine pancreas divide more rapidly than the tissues that surround them. For reasons that we do not understand, these cells can make a mistake when they copy their DNA as they are dividing to replace other dying cells. In this manner, an abnormal cell can be made. When an abnormal ductal cell begins to divide in an unregulated way, a growth can form that is made up of abnormal looking and functioning cells. The abnormal changes that can be recognized under the microscope are called ""dysplasia."" Often, dysplastic cells can undergo additional DNA mistakes over time and become even more abnormal. When these dysplastic cells invade through the walls of the duct from which they arise into the surrounding tissue, the dysplasia has become a cancer.''In a study published in 2016, researchers reported analysis of the genes in 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Subsequent expression analysis of these adenocarcinomas allowed them to be defined into four subtypes. These subtypes have not been previously discerned. The subtypes include:''These new findings may allow future cancer patients to be treated more specifically depending on their subtype and, hopefully, more effectively. For example, the immunogenic subtype could possibly respond to therapy where the immune system is re-engineered to attack these types of cancer cells.''Pancreatic cancer should not be confused with the term ''pancreatitis''. Pancreatitis is simply defined as inflammation of the pancreas and is mainly caused by ''alcohol abuse'' and /or gallstone formation (about 80% to 90%). Nevertheless, ''chronic pancreatitis'' is associated with pancreatic cancer.' Squamous: These tumors have enriched TP53 and KDMA mutations. Pancreatic progenitor: These tumors express genes involved in pancreatic development such as FOXA2/3, PDX1, and MNX1. Aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX): These tumors display the genes (KRAS) and exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL) plus endocrine (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2) differentiation. Immunogenic: These tumors contain pathways that are involved in acquired immune suppression."
What are pancreatic cancer causes and risk factors?,"""About 53,670 cases of pancreatic cancer occur yearly in the United States. Most people who develop pancreatic cancer do so without any predisposing risk factors. However, perhaps the biggest risk factor is increasing age; being over the age of 60 puts an individual at greater risk. Rarely, there can be familial or hereditary genetic syndromes arising from genetic mutations that run in families and put individuals at higher risk, such as BRCA-2 and, to a lesser extent, BRCA-1 gene mutations. Familial syndromes are unusual, but it is important to let a doctor know if anyone else in the family has been diagnosed with cancer, especially pancreatic cancer. Additionally, certain behaviors or conditions are thought to slightly increase an individual's risk for developing pancreatic cancer. For example, African-Americans may be at greater risk as may individuals with close family members who have been previously diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Other behaviors or conditions that may put people at risk include tobacco use, ""'obesity'', a sedentary lifestyle, a history of ''diabetes'', chronic pancreatic inflammation (pancreatitis), and a fatty (or Western) ''diet'"". Prior stomach surgery may moderately increase one's risk as can certain chronic infections such as ""'hepatitis B'' and ''H. pylori'' (a bacterial infection of the stomach lining). Certain ''drugs'' (''sitagliptin'' [''Januvia''], ''exenatide'' [''Byetta''], ''liraglutide'' [''Victoza''], and ''metformin and sitagliptin'' [''Janumet'']) have been linked to the development of pancreatic cancer. Some types of ''pancreatic cysts'' may put individuals at risk of developing pancreatic cancer. A few researchers suggest drinking coffee and soda pop increases risk for pancreatic cancer. When pancreatic cancer begins, it usually starts in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas and is termed ''pancreatic adenocarcinoma'' or ''pancreatic exocrine cancer''. Despite the associated risks cited above, no identifiable cause is found in most people who develop pancreatic cancer.'  "
What are pancreatic cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Because the pancreas lies deep in the belly in front of the spine, pancreatic cancer often grows silently for months before it is discovered. Early ''cancer symptoms'' and/or first signs can be absent or quite subtle. More easily identifiable symptoms develop once the tumor grows large enough to press on other nearby structures, such as nerves (which causes generalize ''pain'' and/or ''back pain''), the intestines (which affects appetite and causes ''nausea'' along with ''weight loss''), or the bile ducts (which causes ''jaundice'' or a yellowing of the skin and can cause ''loss of appetite'' and ''itching''). Symptoms in women rarely differ from those in men. Once the tumor sheds cancer cells into the blood and lymph systems and metastasizes, additional symptoms usually arise, depending on the location of the metastasis. Frequent sites of metastasis for pancreatic cancer include the liver, the ''lymph nodes'', and the lining of the abdomen (called the peritoneum; ''ascites'' fluid may accumulate in metastatic pancreatic cancer). Unfortunately, most pancreatic cancers are found after the cancer has grown or progressed beyond the pancreas or has metastasized to other places.''In general, the signs and ''symptoms of pancreatic cancer'' can be produced by exocrine or endocrine cancer cells. Many of the signs and symptoms of exocrine pancreatic cancer result from blockage of the duct that travels through the pancreas from the liver carrying bile to the intestine. Symptoms of exocrine pancreatic cancer include''The signs and symptoms of endocrine pancreatic cancers are often related to the excess hormones that they produce and consequently to a variety of different symptoms. Such symptoms are related to the hormones and are as follows:'""Nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors don't make excess hormones but can grow large and spread out of the pancreas. Symptoms then can be like any of the endocrine pancreatic cancers described above.""   jaundice, dark urine, itchy skin, light-colored stools, pain in the abdomen or the back, poor appetite and weight loss, digestive problems (pale and/or greasy stools, nausea, and vomiting), blood clots, and enlarged gallbladder. Insulinomas: Insulin-producing tumors that lower blood glucose (sugar) levels can cause low blood sugars that result in weakness, confusion, coma, and even death. Glucagonomas: Glucagon-producing tumors can increase glucose levels and cause symptoms of diabetes (thirst, increased urination, diarrhea and skin changes, especially a characteristic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema). Gastrinomas: Gastrin-producing tumors trigger the stomach to produce too much acid, which leads to ulcers, black tarry stools, and anemia. Somatostatinomas: Somatostatin-producing tumors result in other hormones being overregulated and producing symptoms of diabetes, diarrhea, belly pain, jaundice, and possibly other problems. VIPomas: These tumors produce a substance called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) that may cause severe watery diarrhea and digestive problems along with high blood glucose levels. PPomas: These tumors produce pancreatic polypeptide (PP) that affects both endocrine and exocrine functions, resulting in abdominal pain, enlarged livers, and watery diarrhea. Carcinoid tumors: These tumors make serotonin or its precursor, 5-HTP, and may cause the carcinoid syndrome with symptoms of flushing of the skin, diarrhea, wheezing, and a rapid heart rate that occurs episodically; eventually, a heart murmur, shortness of breath, and weakness develop due to damage to the heart valves."
What tests do doctors use to diagnose pancreatic cancer?,"'Most people do not need to be screened for pancreatic cancer, and the tests available for screening frequently are complex, risky, expensive, or insensitive in the early phases of the cancer. Those who may qualify usually have a set of factors that increase the risk for pancreatic cancer, such as pancreatic ''cysts'', first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, or a history of genetic syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer. Most screening tests consist of ''CT scans'', ultrasounds, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP''), or endoscopic ultrasounds. Unfortunately, early detection of pancreatic cancer is difficult because few or no symptoms are present.''Most people with pancreatic cancer first go to their primary-care doctor complaining of nonspecific symptoms (see symptoms section above). Some warning signs include pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, ''fatigue'', and increased abdominal fluid. These complaints trigger an evaluation often including a physical examination (usually normal), blood tests, ''X-rays'', and an ''ultrasound''. If pancreatic cancer is present, the likelihood of an ultrasound revealing an abnormality in the pancreas is about 75%. If a problem is identified or suspected, frequently a computed tomography (CT) scan is performed as the next step in the evaluation; some clinicians prefer an ''MRI''. If a pancreatic mass is seen, that raises the suspicion of pancreatic cancer and a doctor then performs a biopsy to yield a diagnosis.''Different strategies can be used to perform a biopsy of the suspected cancer. Often, a needle biopsy of the liver through the belly wall (percutaneous ''liver biopsy'') will be used if it appears that there has been spread of the cancer to the liver. If the tumor remains localized to the pancreas, biopsy of the pancreas directly usually is performed with the aid of a CT. A direct biopsy also can be made via an endoscope put down the throat and into the intestines. A camera on the tip of the endoscope allows the endoscopist to advance the endoscope within the intestine. An ultrasound device at the tip of the endoscope locates the area of the pancreas to be biopsied, and a biopsy needle is passed through a working channel in the endoscope to obtain tissue from the suspected cancer. Ultimately, a tissue diagnosis is the only way to make the diagnosis with certainty, and the team of doctors works to obtain a tissue diagnosis in the easiest way possible.''In addition to radiologic tests, suspicion of a pancreatic cancer can arise from the elevation of a ""tumor marker,"" a blood test which can be abnormally high in people with pancreatic cancer. The tumor marker most commonly associated with pancreatic cancer is called the CA19-9. It often is released into the bloodstream by pancreatic cancer cells and may be elevated in patients newly found to have pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, although the CA19-9 test is cancer-related, it is not specific for pancreatic cancer. Other cancers as well as some benign conditions can cause the CA 19-9 to be elevated. Sometimes (about 20% of the time) the CA19-9 will be at normal levels in the blood despite a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, so the tumor marker is not perfect. It can be helpful, however, to follow during the course of illness since its rise and fall may correlate with the cancer\'s growth and help guide appropriate therapy.' "
How do health care professionals determine the stage of pancreatic cancer?,"'Once pancreatic cancer is diagnosed, it is ""staged."" Pancreatic cancer is broken into four stages with stage 1 being the earliest stage (stage 0 is not counted) and stage IV being the most advanced (metastatic disease). The following are the stages of pancreatic cancer according to the National Cancer Institute:''Stage 0'': Cancer is found only in the lining of the pancreatic ducts. Stage 0 also is called ''carcinoma in situ''.''Stage I'': Cancer has formed and is in the pancreas only.''Stage II'': Cancer may have spread or advanced to nearby tissue and organs and lymph nodes near the pancreas.''Stage III'': Cancer has spread or progressed to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.''Stage IV'': Cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal ''cavity''. It also may have spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes. This stage has also been termed end stage pancreatic cancer.''Unlike many cancers, however, patients with pancreatic cancer are typically grouped into three categories, those with local disease, those with locally advanced, unresectable disease, and those with metastatic disease. Initial therapy often differs for patients in these three groups.''Patients with stage I and stage II cancers are thought to have local or ""resectable"" cancer (cancer that can be completely removed with an operation). Patients with stage III cancers have ""locally advanced, unresectable"" disease. In this situation, the opportunity for cure has been lost but local treatments such as ''radiation therapy'' remain options. In patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer, chemotherapy is most commonly recommended as a means of controlling the symptoms related to the cancer and extending life. Below, we will review common treatments for the three groups of pancreatic cancers (resectable, locally advanced unresectable, and metastatic pancreatic cancer).' Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters. Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to other nearby tissue and organs."
What are treatment options for resectable pancreatic cancer?,"'If a pancreatic cancer is found at an early stage (stage I and stage II) and is contained locally within or around the pancreas, surgery may be recommended (resectable pancreatic cancer). Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic cancer. The surgical procedure most commonly performed to remove a pancreatic cancer is a Whipple procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy). It often comprises removal of a portion of the stomach, the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), pancreas, a portion of the main bile duct, lymph nodes, and gallbladder. It is important to be evaluated at a hospital with lots of experience performing pancreatic cancer surgery because the operation is a big one, and evidence shows that experienced surgeons better select people who can get through the surgery safely and also better judge who will most likely benefit from the operation. In experienced hands, the mortality from the surgery itself is less than 4%.''After the Whipple surgery, patients typically spend about one week in the hospital recovering from the operation. Complications from the surgery can include blood loss (''anemia''), leakage from the reconnected intestines or ducts, or slow return of bowel function. Recovery to presurgical health often can take several months.''After patients recover from a Whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer, treatment to reduce the risk of the cancer returning is a standard recommendation. This treatment, referred to as ""adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy),"" has proven to lower the risk of recurrent cancer. Typically, physicians recommend six months of ''adjuvant chemotherapy'', sometimes with ''radiation'' incorporated into the treatment plan.''Some patients with pancreatic cancer experience blockage of bile and/or pancreas ducts and thus may need a surgeon to place a ''stent'' to allow drainage through the stent.''Unfortunately, only about 20 people out of 100 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are found to have a tumor that is amenable to surgical resection or is borderline resectable. The rest have pancreatic tumors that are too locally advanced to completely remove or have metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis. Even among patients whose cancers are amenable to surgery, statistical data suggest that only 20% live 5 years. Most pancreatic cancer patients do not qualify for a pancreas transplant because of their advanced disease; most pancreas transplants are done in patients with ''diabetes'' that results from the removal of the endocrine portion of the pancreas and not for pancreatic cancer. Consequently, remission rates are fair to poor.'  "
What is the treatment for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer?,"'If a pancreatic cancer is found when it has grown into important local structures but not yet spread to distant sites, this is described as locally advanced, unresectable (inoperable) pancreatic cancer (stage III). The standard of care in the United States for the treatment of locally advanced cancer is a combination of low-dose chemotherapy given simultaneously with radiation treatments to the pancreas and surrounding tissues. Radiation treatments are designed to lower the risk of local growth of the cancer, thereby minimizing the symptoms that local progression causes (back or belly pain, nausea, loss of appetite, intestinal blockage, jaundice). Radiation treatments are typically given Monday through Friday for about five weeks. Chemotherapy given concurrently (at the same time; FOLFOX combination therapy) may improve the effectiveness of the radiation and may lower the risk for cancer spread outside the area where the radiation is delivered. When the radiation is completed and the patient has recovered, more chemotherapy often is recommended. Recently, newer forms of radiation delivery (proton therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, gamma knife radiation, Nanoknife, CyberKnife radiation) have been utilized in locally advanced pancreatic cancer with varying degrees of success, but these treatments can be more toxic and are, for now, largely experimental; individuals should discuss with their doctors what treatment(s) are best for their condition.' "
What are treatment options for metastatic pancreatic cancer?,"'Once a pancreatic cancer has spread beyond the vicinity of the pancreas and involves other organs, it has become a problem through the system. As a result, a systemic treatment is most appropriate and chemotherapy (for example, nab-paclitaxel [Abraxane] in combination with gemcitabine [''Gemzar'']) is recommended. Chemotherapy travels through the bloodstream and goes anywhere the blood flows and, as such, treats most of the body. It can attack a cancer that has spread through the body wherever it is found. In metastatic pancreatic cancer, chemotherapy is recommended for individuals healthy enough to receive it. It has been proven to both extend the lives of patients with pancreatic cancer and to improve their quality of life. These benefits are documented, but unfortunately the overall benefit from chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer treatment is modest and chemotherapy prolongs life for the average patient by only a few months. Chemotherapy options for patients with pancreatic cancer vary from treatment with a single chemotherapy agent like ''Tarceva'' or Onivyde to treatment with as many as two or three chemotherapy agents or immunotherapy agents given together (for example, ''capecitabine'' plus ruxolitinib). The aggressiveness of the treatment is determined by the cancer doctor (medical oncologist) and by the overall health and strength of the individual patient.' "
What are the side effects of pancreatic cancer treatment?,"'Side effects of treatment for pancreatic cancer vary depending on the type of treatment. For example, radiation treatment (which is a local treatment) side effects tend to accumulate throughout the course of radiation therapy and include ''fatigue'', nausea, and diarrhea. Chemotherapy side effects depend on the type of chemotherapy given (less aggressive chemotherapy treatments typically cause fewer side effects whereas more aggressive combination regimens are more toxic) and can include ''fatigue'', loss of appetite, change in taste, ''hair loss'' (although not usually), and lowering of the immune system with risk for infections (immunosuppression). While these lists of side effects may seem worrisome, radiation doctors (radiation oncologists) and medical oncologists have much better supportive medications than they did in years past to control any nausea, pain, diarrhea, or immunosuppression related to treatment. The risks associated with pancreatic cancer treatment must be weighed against the inevitable and devastating risks associated with uncontrolled pancreatic cancer and, if the treatments control progression of the cancer, most patients feel better on treatment than they otherwise would.' "
What is the survival rate with pancreatic cancer?,"'Pancreatic cancer is a difficult disease. Even for surgically resectable (and therefore potentially curable) pancreatic tumors, the risk of cancer recurrence and subsequent death remains high. Consequently, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer usually ranges from fair to poor. Only about 20% of patients undergoing a Whipple procedure for potentially curable pancreatic cancer live five years, with the rest surviving on average less than two years. For patients with incurable (locally advanced unresectable or metastatic) pancreatic cancer, survival is even shorter; typically, it is measured in months. With metastatic disease (stage IV), the average survival is just over six months. The American Cancer Society statistics suggest that for all stages of pancreatic cancer combined, the one-year survival rate is 20% and the mortality rate is 80%, while the five-year survival rate is 6% with a mortality rate of 94%. These rates are mainly based on patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2004 and are representative of those patients according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). These data-based survival rates are what are available currently, but they are only estimates and are not predictive about what may happen to each individual. Currently, the ACS advises patients to discuss their individual situation and prognosis with their treatment team of physicians. Doctors around the world continue to study pancreatic cancer and strive to improve treatments, but progress has been difficult to achieve.'  "
What research is being done on pancreatic cancer?,"'Doctors and researchers all over the world are hard at work developing better treatments for pancreatic cancer. Cooperative cancer research led by centers of excellence in this country and many others continue daily to test new surgical techniques, radiation strategies, chemotherapy agents, and alternative therapies in an effort to improve care. Given the slow progress experienced over the last quarter century, many doctors feel that every eligible patient with pancreatic cancer should be offered enrollment in a research trial. New cytotoxic combinations of drugs are being tried in clinical trials. For example, Folfirinox, a new combination regimen consisting of four different chemicals has shown increased survival times for patients in clinical trials. In addition, patients who received one of two ''vaccines'', GVAX and CRS-207, showed about a doubling of survival time compared to patients that did not receive the ''vaccine''; this vaccine protocol is still undergoing clinical trials. For a complete list of clinical trials in pancreatic cancer treatment, please check online at ''http://www.cancer.gov''.' "
Is complimentary or alternative medicine effective in pancreatic cancer treatment?,"'Complimentary or alternative medicine is of unclear benefit in pancreatic cancer treatment. No specific complimentary or alternative therapy has been proven beneficial, but many adjunctive treatments have been tried. Compounds such as curcumin, the principle ingredient in turmeric, have shown efficacy in nonhuman research and are being tested in clinical trials in pancreatic cancer. Given the modest benefit derived from chemotherapy and radiation in this disease, alternative approaches in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in conjunction with (rather than instead of) standard treatment is warranted.' "
Is it possible to prevent pancreatic cancer?,"'At this time, there is no known surveillance strategy to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer for the general population. With only 48,900 new diagnoses a year, screening blood tests or X-rays have never been proven to be cost effective or beneficial. Additionally, doctors do not routinely screen individuals with family members diagnosed with pancreatic cancer aside from the rare instance where a known genetic risk factor is present. Some researchers suggest ''vitamin D'' blood levels above 40 ng/ml may reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.' "
Where can people get support when coping with pancreatic cancer?,"'There are many fine organizations helping to provide support for individuals and families battling pancreatic cancer. Many hospitals provide support networks utilizing the expertise of trained social workers with experience in caring for people with cancer. Additionally, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PANCAN) and the American Cancer Society both provide information and support for people living with pancreatic cancer. Visit their web sites at ''http://www.pancan.org'' and ''http://www.cancer.org''. ''Diet'' recommendations can be found at ''ACS Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention''.' "
Where can people find additional information about pancreatic cancer?,"'Again, both PANCAN and the American Cancer Society are excellent resources for additional information regarding pancreatic cancer. The American Society of Clinical ''Oncology'' web site (''http://www.cancer.net'') also boasts a wealth of information for patients, family members, and professionals interesting in learning more about this disease. November is Pancreatic Awareness Month with the goal to make pancreas care an everyday event (http://daysofyear.com/pancreatic-cancer-awareness-month/).' "
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
What are pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)?,"'Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas. The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.''There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:''Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not ''cancer'') or ''malignant'' (''cancer''). When pancreatic NETs are ''malignant'', they are called pancreatic endocrine ''cancer'' or islet cell ''carcinoma''.''Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.''Pancreatic NETs may or may not cause signs or symptoms.''Pancreatic NETs may be functional or nonfunctional:''Most pancreatic NETs are functional tumors.'  Endocrine pancreas cells make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs). Exocrine pancreas cells make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells. Functional tumors make extra amounts of hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon, that cause signs and symptoms. Nonfunctional tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones. Signs and symptoms are caused by the tumor as it spreads and grows. Most nonfunctional tumors are malignant (cancer)."
What are the different types of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs. Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs include the following:''These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.' Gastrinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an acid that helps digest food. Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by gastrinomas. When increased stomach acid, stomach ulcers, and diarrhea are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer). Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer). Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the liver to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas. Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer). Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include:VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin. VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome. Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin."
What are risk factors for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"""Having certain syndromes can increase the risk of pancreatic NETs. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.""'Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is a risk factor for pancreatic NETs.' "
What are signs and symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'Different types of pancreatic NETs have different signs and symptoms. Signs or symptoms can be caused by the growth of the tumor and/or by hormones the tumor makes or by other conditions. Some tumors may not cause signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.''A non-functional pancreatic NET may grow for a long time without causing signs or symptoms. It may grow large or spread to other parts of the body before it causes signs or symptoms, such as:''The signs and symptoms of a functional pancreatic NET depend on the type of hormone being made.''Too much gastrin may cause:''Too much insulin may cause:''Too much glucagon may cause:''Too much vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may cause:''Too much somatostatin may cause:'  Diarrhea. Indigestion. A lump in the abdomen. Pain in the abdomen or back. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Stomach ulcers that keep coming back. Pain in the abdomen, which may spread to the back. The pain may come and go and it may go away after taking an antacid. The flow of stomach contents back into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). Diarrhea. Low blood sugar. This can cause blurred vision, headache, and feeling lightheaded, tired, weak, shaky, nervous, irritable, sweaty, confused, or hungry. Fast heartbeat. Skin rash on the face, stomach, or legs. High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent urination, dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak. Blood clots. Blood clots in the lung can cause shortness of breath, cough, or pain in the chest. Blood clots in the arm or leg can cause pain, swelling, warmth, or redness of the arm or leg. Diarrhea. Weight loss for no known reason. Sore tongue or sores at the corners of the mouth. Very large amounts of watery diarrhea. Dehydration. This can cause feeling thirsty, making less urine, dry skin and mouth, headaches, dizziness, or feeling tired. Low potassium level in the blood. This can cause muscle weakness, aching, or cramps, numbness and tingling, frequent urination, fast heartbeat, and feeling confused or thirsty. Cramps or pain in the abdomen. Weight loss for no known reason. High blood sugar. This can cause headaches, frequent urination, dry skin and mouth, or feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, or weak. Diarrhea. Steatorrhea (very foul-smelling stool that floats). Gallstones. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Weight loss for no known reason."
What tests do doctors use to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'Lab tests and imaging tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose pancreatic NETs. The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as glucose (sugar), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Chromogranin A test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of chromogranin A in the blood. A higher than normal amount of chromogranin A and normal amounts of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon can be a sign of a non-functional pancreatic NET. Abdominal CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A catheter (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts. A dye is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken. If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. Tissue samples may also be taken and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Angiogram: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood. A contrast dye is injected into the blood vessel. As the contrast dye moves through the blood vessel, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages. Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Intraoperative ultrasound: A procedure that uses high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) to create images of internal organs or tissues during surgery. A transducer placed directly on the organ or tissue is used to make the sound waves, which create echoes. The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called sonograms. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic NETs. Cells may be removed using a fine or wide needle inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or ultrasound. Tissue may also be removed during a laparoscopy (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen). Bone scan: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in bones where cancer cells have spread and is detected by a scanner."
What tests assess the specific type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor?,"'Other kinds of lab tests are used to check for the specific type of pancreatic NETs. The following tests and procedures may be used:' Fasting serum gastrin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of gastrin in the blood. This test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. Conditions other than gastrinoma can cause an increase in the amount of gastrin in the blood. Basal acid output test: A test to measure the amount of acid made by the stomach. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. A tube is inserted through the nose or throat, into the stomach. The stomach contents are removed and four samples of gastric acid are removed through the tube. These samples are used to find out the amount of gastric acid made during the test and the pH level of the gastric secretions. Secretin stimulation test: If the basal acid output test result is not normal, a secretin stimulation test may be done. The tube is moved into the small intestine and samples are taken from the small intestine after a drug called secretin is injected. Secretin causes the small intestine to make acid. When there is a gastrinoma, the secretin causes an increase in how much gastric acid is made and the level of gastrin in the blood. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body. This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS. Fasting serum glucose and insulin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of glucose (sugar) and insulin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 24 hours. Fasting serum glucagon test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of glucagon in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours. VIPomaSerum VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of VIP.Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. In VIPoma, there is a lower than normal amount of potassium.Stool analysis: A stool sample is checked for a higher than normal sodium (salt) and potassium levels. Serum VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of VIP. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. In VIPoma, there is a lower than normal amount of potassium. Stool analysis: A stool sample is checked for a higher than normal sodium (salt) and potassium levels. SomatostatinomaFasting serum somatostatin test: A test in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of somatostatin in the blood. The test is done after the patient has had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours.Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy: A type of radionuclide scan that may be used to find small pancreatic NETs. A small amount of radioactive octreotide (a hormone that attaches to tumors) is injected into a vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive octreotide attaches to the tumor and a special camera that detects radioactivity is used to show where the tumors are in the body.

This procedure is also called octreotide scan and SRS."
What factors affect the treatment options and prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,'Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Pancreatic NETs can often be cured. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:'  The type of cancer cell. Where the tumor is found in the pancreas. Whether the tumor has spread to more than one place in the pancreas or to other parts of the body. Whether the patient has MEN1 syndrome. The patient's age and general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
How do doctors determine the staging of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor?,"'The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread. The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are also used to find out whether the cancer has spread. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.''Although there is a standard staging system for pancreatic NETs, it is not used to plan treatment. Treatment of pancreatic NETs is based on the following:' Whether the cancer is found in one place in the pancreas. Whether the cancer is found in several places in the pancreas. Whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas or to other parts of the body such as the liver, lung, peritoneum, or bone."
How does cancer spread in the body?,"'There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
What is metastasis?,"'Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the ''primary tumor''. For example, if a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually neuroendocrine tumor cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
What are recurrent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,'Recurrent pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are tumors that have recurred (come back) after being treated. The tumors may come back in the pancreas or in other parts of the body.' 
What are the treatment options for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs. Different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When ''clinical trials'' show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Six types of standard treatment are used:''An operation may be done to remove the tumor. One of the following types of surgery may be used:''Chemotherapy'' is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When ''chemotherapy'' is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the ''drugs'' enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.''Hormone therapy'' is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or ''radiation therapy'' is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.''Hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver). This is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.''Chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and ''cuts'' off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.''The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic NETs.''Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:' Enucleation: Surgery to remove the tumor only. This may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas. Pancreatoduodenectomy: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. The organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient's condition. This is also called the Whipple procedure. Distal pancreatectomy: Surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas. The spleen may also be removed. Total gastrectomy: Surgery to remove the whole stomach. Parietal cell vagotomy: Surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid. Liver resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the liver. Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia. Cryosurgical ablation: A procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells. This is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide. The instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin. This procedure is also called cryoablation. Stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as:Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole.Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole. Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine. Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Diarrhea may be treated with:Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride.Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride. Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide. Low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level. High blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection."
Are there clinical trials for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors?,"'New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the ''NCI website''.''Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "

What should I know about pancreatitis?,"'What is the medical definition of pancreatitis?''How do I know if I have pancreatitis?''How to test for pancreatitis''How to treat pancreatitis''What are the complications of pancreatitis?''What is the pancreatitis prognosis?' Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Of the many causes of pancreatitis, the most common are alcohol consumption and gallstones. About 210,000 cases of acute pancreatitis occur in the U.S. every year. Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain that may radiate to the back Pain that worsens after eating Chills and fever Tenderness of the abdomen to touch Lethargy and weakness Diagnosis of pancreatitis is generally with blood and imaging tests. Most cases of acute pancreatitis require hospitalization; however, treatment of chronic pancreatitis may be managed in an outpatient setting. Diabetes Pancreatic cancer Malnutrition Infection Pseudocyst formation Pancreatitis can range from a mild, self-limited disease to a condition with life-threatening complications."
What is pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas.''Pancreatitis is categorized as being either acute or chronic.''Pancreatitis is a condition that may be mild and self-limiting, though it can also lead to severe complications that can be life-threatening. The acute form of pancreatitis, in its most severe form, can have deleterious effects on many other body organs, including the ''lungs'' and kidneys.' The pancreas is an abdominal gland situated behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. The main function of the pancreas is to secrete hormones and enzymes that help with digestion and regulate blood sugar (glucose) metabolism. The digestive enzymes are released via the pancreatic duct into the small intestine where they are activated to help break down fats and proteins. The digestive hormones (insulin and glucagon) produced by the pancreas are released into the blood stream where they help regulate blood sugar levels. Acute pancreatitis generally develops suddenly, and it is usually a short-term (a few days to weeks) illness that typically resolves with appropriate medical management. Chronic pancreatitis, which typically develops after multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis, is a long-term condition that can last for months or even several years."
What are the signs and symptoms of pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis causes upper ''abdominal pain'' which can range from mild to severe.''The ''pain'' may come on suddenly or it may develop gradually. Often, the pain will start or worsen after eating, which can also occur with gallbladder or ulcer pain. ''Abdominal pain'' tends to be the hallmark of acute pancreatitis. People with acute pancreatitis usually feel very ill.''Acute pancreatitis signs and symptoms may include:''In chronic pancreatitis, abdominal pain also can be present, but it is often not as severe, and some people may not have any pain at all.''Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms may include:'   Abdominal pain that may radiate to the back Nausea and vomiting Worsening pain after eating Tenderness to touch of the abdomen Fever and chills Weakness and lethargy Abdominal pain Unintentional weight loss Foul smelling, oily stool"
10 Causes of pancreatitis?,"'Normally, digestive enzymes released by the pancreas are not activated to break down fats and proteins until they reach the small intestine. However, when these digestive enzymes are activated while still in the pancreas, inflammation and local damage to the pancreas occurs leading to pancreatitis.''The causes of pancreatitis include:''Alcohol consumption and ''gallstones'' account for over 80% of all cases of pancreatitis in the US.'   Alcohol consumption Gallstones High triglyceride levels Abdominal injury or surgery Certain medications Exposure to certain chemicals Smoking Family history of pancreatitis Cystic fibrosis Pancreatic cancer"
How is pancreatitis diagnosed?,"'There are a number of tests that alone, or in combination, will help establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis.''Amylase and/or lipase levels are typically elevated in cases of acute pancreatitis. These blood tests may not be elevated in cases of chronic pancreatitis. These are usually the first tests performed to establish the diagnosis of pancreatitis, as these results are generally readily and quickly available. Other blood tests may be ordered, for example:''A CT (computed tomography) scan of the abdomen may be ordered to visualize the pancreas and to evaluate the extent of inflammation, as well as any of the potential complications that can arise from pancreatitis, such as bleeding or pseudocyst (a collection of fluid) formation. The ''CT scan'' may also detect gallstones (a major cause of pancreatitis) and other abnormalities of the biliary system.''Ultrasound'' imaging can be used to look for gallstones and abnormalities of the biliary system. Because ultrasound imaging does not emit ''radiation'', this modality is frequently the initial imaging test obtained in cases of pancreatitis.''Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis and the severity of illness, additional testing may be ordered.' Liver and kidney function tests Tests for infection Tests for anemia"
What is the treatment for pancreatitis?,"'In most cases of acute pancreatitis, admission to the hospital is needed, whereas some cases of chronic pancreatitis can be managed in an outpatient setting.''Depending on the underlying cause of pancreatitis, management may vary to address the specific cause. In general, however, the following treatment regimen will always be initiated for the treatment of pancreatitis.''First-line treatment will involve:''If pancreatitis is due to an obstructing gallstone, surgical intervention may be required to remove the gallstone and/or remove the gallbladder. Intervention may also be required to treat a pseudocyst or to remove part of the affected pancreas.''If alcohol consumption is the cause of pancreatitis, abstinence from alcohol and an alcohol rehabilitation program will be recommended.''If a medication or chemical exposure is found to be the cause of pancreatitis, then removal of the medication or offending exposure is recommended.''If high ''triglycerides'"" are the cause of pancreatitis, then your health-care professional may prescribe medication to decrease the patient's ""'triglyceride levels''.'   Fasting to help the pancreas to rest and recover. IV fluids to prevent dehydration while fasting Pancreatitis can be very painful, thus intravenous pain medication is often necessary."
Medications for pancreatitis,"'In general, the above treatment regimen is the mainstay of pancreatitis management.''Pain medication and medication to control nausea may also be prescribed.''In cases of chronic pancreatitis, your health-care professional also may prescribe pancreatic enzyme ''supplements'' in order to help the body digest certain nutrients.' "
Is there a diet for pancreatitis?,"'For people with pancreatitis, low-fat meals that are high in nutrients is the recommended ''diet''. Adequate fluid intake is also recommended to prevent ''dehydration''.' "
What are some of the complications of pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis can be a life-threatening illness with severe complications. Complications may include:' Diabetes: Damage to the pancreas can lead to diabetes due to the disruption in the secretion of insulin. Pseudocyst formation: During acute pancreatitis, fluid and debris can collect in and around the pancreas. If rupture of this fluid-containing sac occurs, severe pain, infection and internal bleeding can result. Malnutrition: Damage to the pancreas can lead to a decrease or absence of digestive enzymes produced, which can affect the absorption of various nutrients. This may lead to malnutrition and unintentional weight loss. Pancreatic cancer: Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. Infection: Individuals with pancreatitis are at risk for the development of infection, which can lead to multi-organ failure, sepsis and ultimately death."
Can pancreatitis be prevented?," Certain lifestyle changes can decrease the chances of someone getting pancreatitis, such as alcohol and smoking cessation. Consuming a low-fat diet and maintaining a healthy weight can decrease the risk of developing gallstones, a leading cause of pancreatitis."
What is the prognosis for pancreatitis?,"""The prognosis for pancreatitis depends on many different factors, such as the underlying condition causing pancreatitis, the severity of the pancreatitis, and the patient's age and underlying medical problems. Patients with pancreatitis can experience everything from a brief self-limited illness with a full recovery to severe course of illness that can lead to life-threatening complications and death. If an individual has repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, they may develop chronic pancreatitis, a lifelong condition that can lead to a decreased quality of life."" "
What is pancreatitis?,"'Pancreatitis is when the pancreas develops swelling due to the destruction of the pancreatic tissue.\xa0''Pancreatitis'' is a condition in which the pancreas develops swelling due to the destruction of the pancreatic tissue by its own enzymes. ''Digestive enzymes'' travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through the pancreatic duct. Usually, they are not activated until they reach the small intestine, but if the pancreatic duct is blocked, the enzymes become trapped and get accumulated in the pancreas. Eventually, these enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas and begin irritating the tissue of the pancreas, causing inflammation, bleeding, and damage to the pancreas.\xa0There are two types of pancreatitis that are as follows:' Acute pancreatitis: It is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas that results in extreme abdominal pain, and it usually reduces on its own within one week.  Chronic pancreatitis: It is a long-term condition that impairs the functioning of the pancreas. It affects the body’s ability to digest food and other functions."
What are the common symptoms of pancreatitis?,'The most common symptom of pancreatitis is severe upper ''stomach pain'' that may radiate to the back or chest and may feel worse after eating or drinking ''alcohol''.''Typical signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:''Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include:' Pain in the stomach (belly) Nausea Vomiting Fever Dehydration Rapid heartbeat Abdominal tenderness Skin discoloration around the navel (belly button) Unintentional weight loss Bloating Diarrhea Jaundice Decreased ability to produce insulin Indigestion Oily or smelly stools Fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity Dropping blood pressure Hypoxia and lung failure (breathing problems) Kidney failure

What are the common tests to diagnose pancreatitis?,"'Common tests to diagnose pancreatitis include:' Various blood tests: Blood tests may be ordered by the doctor to know the levels of digestive enzymes in the blood such as amylase and lipase. The doctor may also check for blood sugar levels, triglycerides, lipids, and fats in the blood. Blood tests also help in identifying signs of an infection or inflammation of the bile ducts, pancreas, gallbladder, or liver and pancreatic cancer. Stool tests: Stool samples may determine fat malabsorption. Imaging tests: Ultrasound; computed tomography (CT) scans of the pancreas, gallbladder, and bile ducts; and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) create pictures of the organs and soft tissues to determine abnormalities in the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound: The doctor may insert a thin, flexible tube down the throat, through your stomach, and into your small intestine. The doctor then turns on an ultrasound attachment to create pictures of your pancreas and bile ducts.  Pancreatic function test (PFT): The doctor may use this test to measure how the pancreas responds to secretin, a hormone produced by the small intestine. "

Facts you should know about pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS)," PANDAS is an acronym for ""pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections."" It is a fairly recently described disorder (1990s). An autoimmune response to a streptococcal infection is the leading theory as to the cause of PANDAS. It is diagnosed if there is a history of abrupt development of a number of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with a group A streptococcal (the type of bacteria causing strep throat) infection. Medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for PANDAS."
What is PANDAS?,"'PANDAS is an acronym that refers to ""pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with ''streptococcal infections''."" It is diagnosed clinically after a patient develops a number of behavioral and physical symptoms following a streptococcal infection (for example, ''strep throat'', ''sinusitis'', ''cellulitis'', or ''scarlet fever'').' "
Is PANDAS common?,"'PANDAS is a rare condition. It is believed that approximately one in 200 children are affected, according to PANDAS Network, a research nonprofit for the disease. Doctors may sometimes miss PANDAS diagnoses, however, due to some of the common symptoms associated with the disease. In fact, there are some researchers who recommend categorizing PANDAS as a subset of other disorders, which includes similar neuropsychiatric symptoms called CANS (childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms) or PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome).' "
What is the history of PANDAS?,"'PANDAS was described in the late 1990s after investigators identified a subgroup of children who developed a sudden onset of ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') symptoms, vocal and motor tics, and other behavioral changes. They identified that there was a common association in these children, and that was identified as a recent or active infection with a beta-hemolytic ''Streptococcus'', the bacteria that causes ''strep throat''. Researchers also identified a number of other infectious agents, known to cause significant auto-inflammatory reactions associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including ''influenza'', ''varicella'', and even ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' (''Lyme disease''), but the diagnosis of PANDAS is limited to ''streptococcal infections''.' "
What causes PANDAS?," Consensus opinion is that PANDAS is in part caused by an autoimmune response to a strep infection. Streptococcus is known to be associated with a number of immune-related disorders, includingrheumatic fever,scarlet fever, andacute glomerulonephritis (a kidney disorder). rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and acute glomerulonephritis (a kidney disorder). The strep molecules are known to hide from the host immune system by mimicking host cells. Ultimately, the immune system recognizes the foreign cells, and the antibodies produced attack the bacterium, and unfortunately, some of the host's own cells are attacked as well due to cross-reactivity. In some situations, these antibodies attack brain cells, causingOCD,tics, andthe other symptoms frequently observed in PANDAS patients. OCD, tics, and the other symptoms frequently observed in PANDAS patients."
What are risk factors for PANDAS?,"'Multiple risk factors may play a role in the development of PANDAS, including recurrent group A streptococcal infections, family history of ''rheumatic fever'"", and the mother's history of having an autoimmune disease. PANDAS is also more common in boys and prepubertal children."" "
What are symptoms and signs of PANDAS?,"'PANDAS symptoms are similar to those of''Other symptoms include''Symptoms tend to appear suddenly, and the recovery period is variable. Often the symptoms may worsen during streptococcal infections and improve in between.'   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and motor or verbal tics. separation anxiety (the child has difficulty separating from the parent), mood changes, changes in handwriting, bedwetting or change in urinary frequency, and sleep disturbances."
What type of doctors treat PANDAS?, Most children will first be seen by their pediatrician when symptoms develop. Further management requires referral to a psychiatrist or other mental-health professional who can prescribe medication and provide cognitive behavioral therapy. Other physicians that may aid in the management of PANDAS include a pediatric neurologist or behavioral developmental specialist.
How do health care professionals diagnose PANDAS?,"'PANDAS is diagnosed clinically. That means that it depends more on history and physical examination rather than other specific studies. The following summarizes the five criteria used to diagnose PANDAS:''As mentioned above, there are five criteria used to diagnose the disorder and must include the sudden onset of OCD, tics, ''ADHD'', or a rapid worsening of existing symptoms. To make the diagnosis, one also needs evidence of a recent or active ''strep'' infection either by throat culture or by antibody testing for ''Streptococcus'' (for example, antistreptolysin O or antideoxyribonuclease B antibodies). A onetime measurement of antibodies is not sufficient for the diagnosis; these antibodies should be measured at two different times (four to six weeks apart) to detect a rise in levels. Along with the clinical diagnosis, it is important to be sure that there is not some other reason for the symptoms, and additional testing might be performed for that reason. In fact, distinguishing PANDAS from '""Tourette's""' syndrome (a common tic disorder), OCD, or Sydenham chorea (a movement disorder associated with rheumatic ''fever'' also caused by ''Streptococcus'') is not always a simple task.' Presence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or a tic disorder, ADHD symptoms, or oppositional behaviors Abrupt onset and/or symptoms vary in intensity Association with neurological abnormalities, including motor hyperactivity, or abnormal movements, such as choreiform movements (involuntary jerky movements), other combinations of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, emotional lability, bedwetting, or other regressive behaviors (temper tantrums), personality changes and deterioration in math skills and handwriting Onset of symptoms from age 3 years to puberty Association with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection (the bacteria that causes strep throat) either by culture or other evidence of infection, such as scarlet fever or by laboratory test evidence"
What is the treatment for PANDAS?,"'First-line treatments for PANDAS include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication, depending on the breadth and severity of symptoms.''For severe and refractory symptoms, the use of other treatments aimed at controlling the immune response have been studied and found to be effective. These include the use of''For both treatments, the ""offending"" antibodies are removed. Steroids are less effective, because, although symptoms decrease during the treatment, they return soon after stopping the drug. More studies are needed to be able to recommend immune-modulating therapies without hesitation.'   Currently, the primary medical therapy is focused on controlling the OCD symptoms, and therefore selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are frequently used (fluoxetine [Prozac] and others). The other more acute measure in treating PANDAS is treating the strep infection associated with the symptoms. Antibiotics are the treatment of choice to eradicate an active strep throat infection. Your doctor may prescribe penicillin, amoxicillin (Amoxil), azithromycin (Zithromax), or another antibiotic. intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange therapy, in which blood is withdrawn from an individual and the liquid portion is removed and replaced and the blood is transfused back into the individual)."
What are complications of PANDAS?,'PANDAS has not been associated with the development of ''heart'' issues as seen in children with rheumatic ''fever''. Untreated or unrecognized PANDAS may increase the risk of having OCD and tic disorder into adulthood.' 
What is the prognosis of PANDAS?,"'Though some children completely recover from PANDAS, there are some who develop persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms or develop worsening symptoms after each ''strep'' infection. It is not currently possible to predict which children will be affected or how severely. The mainstay of therapy is to decrease the OCD, tics, or other behaviors that might interfere with daily life and school.' "
Is it possible to prevent PANDAS?,"'For those children diagnosed with PANDAS, there is some evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may play a role in preventing the development of ''strep infections'' and therefore the worsening of symptoms. However, there are side effects associated with daily antibiotic treatment, including ''diarrhea'' and the development of ''antibiotic resistance''. More studies need to be performed to be sure that the preventive treatment is truly effective.''Surgical removal of the ''tonsils'' and ''adenoids'' has not shown to be effective in preventing PANDAS and is thus not recommended.'

It is diagnosed if there is a history of abrupt development of a number of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with a group A streptococcal (the type of bacteria causing strep throat) infection. Medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the primary treatments for PANDAS."
What is PANDAS?,"'PANDAS is an acronym that refers to ""pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with ''streptococcal infections''."" It is diagnosed clinically after a patient develops a number of behavioral and physical symptoms following a streptococcal infection (for example, ''strep throat'', ''sinusitis'', ''cellulitis'', or ''scarlet fever'').' "
Is PANDAS common?,"'PANDAS is a rare condition. It is believed that approximately one in 200 children are affected, according to PANDAS Network, a research nonprofit for the disease. Doctors may sometimes miss PANDAS diagnoses, however, due to some of the common symptoms associated with the disease. In fact, there are some researchers who recommend categorizing PANDAS as a subset of other disorders, which includes similar neuropsychiatric symptoms called CANS (childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms) or PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome).' "
What is the history of PANDAS?,"'PANDAS was described in the late 1990s after investigators identified a subgroup of children who developed a sudden onset of ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') symptoms, vocal and motor tics, and other behavioral changes. They identified that there was a common association in these children, and that was identified as a recent or active infection with a beta-hemolytic ''Streptococcus'', the bacteria that causes ''strep throat''. Researchers also identified a number of other infectious agents, known to cause significant auto-inflammatory reactions associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including ''influenza'', ''varicella'', and even ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' (''Lyme disease''), but the diagnosis of PANDAS is limited to ''streptococcal infections''.' "
What causes PANDAS?," Consensus opinion is that PANDAS is in part caused by an autoimmune response to a strep infection. Streptococcus is known to be associated with a number of immune-related disorders, includingrheumatic fever,scarlet fever, andacute glomerulonephritis (a kidney disorder). rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and acute glomerulonephritis (a kidney disorder). The strep molecules are known to hide from the host immune system by mimicking host cells. Ultimately, the immune system recognizes the foreign cells, and the antibodies produced attack the bacterium, and unfortunately, some of the host's own cells are attacked as well due to cross-reactivity. In some situations, these antibodies attack brain cells, causingOCD,tics, andthe other symptoms frequently observed in PANDAS patients. OCD, tics, and the other symptoms frequently observed in PANDAS patients."
What are risk factors for PANDAS?,"'Multiple risk factors may play a role in the development of PANDAS, including recurrent group A streptococcal infections, family history of ''rheumatic fever'"", and the mother's history of having an autoimmune disease. PANDAS is also more common in boys and prepubertal children."" "
What are symptoms and signs of PANDAS?,"'PANDAS symptoms are similar to those of''Other symptoms include''Symptoms tend to appear suddenly, and the recovery period is variable. Often the symptoms may worsen during streptococcal infections and improve in between.'   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and motor or verbal tics. separation anxiety (the child has difficulty separating from the parent), mood changes, changes in handwriting, bedwetting or change in urinary frequency, and sleep disturbances."
What type of doctors treat PANDAS?, Most children will first be seen by their pediatrician when symptoms develop. Further management requires referral to a psychiatrist or other mental-health professional who can prescribe medication and provide cognitive behavioral therapy. Other physicians that may aid in the management of PANDAS include a pediatric neurologist or behavioral developmental specialist.
How do health care professionals diagnose PANDAS?,"'PANDAS is diagnosed clinically. That means that it depends more on history and physical examination rather than other specific studies. The following summarizes the five criteria used to diagnose PANDAS:''As mentioned above, there are five criteria used to diagnose the disorder and must include the sudden onset of OCD, tics, ''ADHD'', or a rapid worsening of existing symptoms. To make the diagnosis, one also needs evidence of a recent or active ''strep'' infection either by throat culture or by antibody testing for ''Streptococcus'' (for example, antistreptolysin O or antideoxyribonuclease B antibodies). A onetime measurement of antibodies is not sufficient for the diagnosis; these antibodies should be measured at two different times (four to six weeks apart) to detect a rise in levels. Along with the clinical diagnosis, it is important to be sure that there is not some other reason for the symptoms, and additional testing might be performed for that reason. In fact, distinguishing PANDAS from '""Tourette's""' syndrome (a common tic disorder), OCD, or Sydenham chorea (a movement disorder associated with rheumatic ''fever'' also caused by ''Streptococcus'') is not always a simple task.' Presence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or a tic disorder, ADHD symptoms, or oppositional behaviors Abrupt onset and/or symptoms vary in intensity Association with neurological abnormalities, including motor hyperactivity, or abnormal movements, such as choreiform movements (involuntary jerky movements), other combinations of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, emotional lability, bedwetting, or other regressive behaviors (temper tantrums), personality changes and deterioration in math skills and handwriting Onset of symptoms from age 3 years to puberty Association with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection (the bacteria that causes strep throat) either by culture or other evidence of infection, such as scarlet fever or by laboratory test evidence"
What is the treatment for PANDAS?,"'First-line treatments for PANDAS include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication, depending on the breadth and severity of symptoms.''For severe and refractory symptoms, the use of other treatments aimed at controlling the immune response have been studied and found to be effective. These include the use of''For both treatments, the ""offending"" antibodies are removed. Steroids are less effective, because, although symptoms decrease during the treatment, they return soon after stopping the drug. More studies are needed to be able to recommend immune-modulating therapies without hesitation.'   Currently, the primary medical therapy is focused on controlling the OCD symptoms, and therefore selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are frequently used (fluoxetine [Prozac] and others). The other more acute measure in treating PANDAS is treating the strep infection associated with the symptoms. Antibiotics are the treatment of choice to eradicate an active strep throat infection. Your doctor may prescribe penicillin, amoxicillin (Amoxil), azithromycin (Zithromax), or another antibiotic. intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange therapy, in which blood is withdrawn from an individual and the liquid portion is removed and replaced and the blood is transfused back into the individual)."
What are complications of PANDAS?,'PANDAS has not been associated with the development of ''heart'' issues as seen in children with rheumatic ''fever''. Untreated or unrecognized PANDAS may increase the risk of having OCD and tic disorder into adulthood.' 
What is the prognosis of PANDAS?,"'Though some children completely recover from PANDAS, there are some who develop persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms or develop worsening symptoms after each ''strep'' infection. It is not currently possible to predict which children will be affected or how severely. The mainstay of therapy is to decrease the OCD, tics, or other behaviors that might interfere with daily life and school.' "
Is it possible to prevent PANDAS?,"'For those children diagnosed with PANDAS, there is some evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may play a role in preventing the development of ''strep infections'' and therefore the worsening of symptoms. However, there are side effects associated with daily antibiotic treatment, including ''diarrhea'' and the development of ''antibiotic resistance''. More studies need to be performed to be sure that the preventive treatment is truly effective.''Surgical removal of the ''tonsils'' and ''adenoids'' has not shown to be effective in preventing PANDAS and is thus not recommended.' "
What is a panic attack?,"'The above statements are two examples of what a panic attack might feel like. Panic attacks may be symptoms of an ''anxiety disorder''. Historically, panic has been described in ancient civilizations, as with the reaction of the subjects of Ramses II to his death in 1213 BC in Egypt, and in Greek mythology as the reaction that people had to seeing Pan, the half man, half goat god of flocks and shepherds. In medieval then Renaissance Europe, severe ''anxiety'' was grouped with ''depression'' in descriptions of what was then called melancholia. During the 19th century, panic symptoms began to be described as neurosis, and eventually the word panic began being used in psychiatry.''These episodes are a serious health problem in the U.S. At least 20% of adult Americans, or about 60 million people, will suffer from panic at some point in their lives. About 1.7% of adult Americans, or about 3 million people, will have full-blown panic disorder at some time in their lives, women twice as often as men. The most common age at which people have their first panic attack (onset) is between 15 and 19 years of age. Panic attacks are significantly different from other types of ''anxiety'', in that panic attacks are very sudden and often unexpected, appear to be unprovoked, and are often disabling.''Childhood panic disorder facts include that about 0.7% of children suffer from panic disorder or ''generalized anxiety disorder'', half as often as occurs in adolescents. While panic is found to occur twice as often in women compared to men, boys and girls tend to develop this condition at equal frequency.''Once an individual has had a panic attack, for example, while driving, shopping in a crowded store, or riding in an elevator, he or she may develop irrational fears, called ''phobias'', about these situations and begin to avoid them. Eventually, the avoidance and level of nervousness about the possibility of having another attack may reach the point at which the mere idea of engaging in the activities that preceded the first panic attack triggers future panic attacks, resulting in the person with panic disorder potentially being unable to drive or even step out of the house (''agoraphobia''). Thus, there are two types of panic disorder, panic disorder with or without ''agoraphobia''. Like other ''mental health'"" conditions, panic disorder can have a serious impact on a person's daily life unless the individual receives effective treatment.""""Panic attacks in children may cause the child's grades to decline, their avoiding school and other separations from parents, as well as possibly experiencing ""'substance abuse'', ''depression'', or ''suicidal thoughts'', plans, and/or actions.' "
Are panic attacks serious?,"'Yes, panic attacks are real and potentially quite emotionally disabling. Fortunately, they can be controlled with specific treatments. Because of the disturbing physical signs and symptoms that accompany panic attacks, they may be mistaken for ''heart attacks'' or some other life-threatening medical problem.''In fact, up to 25% of people who visit emergency rooms because of ''chest pain'' are actually experiencing panic. This can lead to people with this symptom often undergoing extensive medical testing to rule out physical conditions. Sadly, sometimes more than 90% of these individuals are not appropriately diagnosed as suffering from panic.''Loved ones, as well as medical personnel, generally attempt to reassure the panic attack sufferer that he or she is not in great danger. However, these efforts at reassurance can sometimes add to the patient\'s struggles. If the doctors say things like, ""it\'s nothing serious,"" ""it\'s all in your head,"" or ""nothing to worry about,"" this may give the false impression that there is no real problem, they should be able to overcome their symptoms without help, and that treatment is not possible or necessary.''More accurately, while panic attacks can undoubtedly be serious, they are not organ-threatening. Therefore, for people who might wonder what to do to help the panic sufferer at the time of an ''anxiety'' attack, a more effective approach tends to acknowledge their fear and the intensity of their symptoms while reassuring the person having the panic attack that what is occurring is not life-threatening and can be treated.' "
What causes panic attacks?,"'Although there are not specific causes for panic attacks in adults, ''teens'', or children, like most other emotional symptoms, panic is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and environmental factors like social stressors. According to one theory of panic disorder, the body\'s normal ""alarm system,"" also described as the body\'s fight or flight system, the set of mental and physical mechanisms that allows a person to respond to a threat, tends to be triggered when there is no danger.'""Scientists don't know specifically why this happens or why some people are more susceptible to the problem than others. Panic disorder has been found to run in families, and this may mean that inheritance (genetics) plays a role in determining who will develop the condition. However, many people who have no family history of the disorder develop it. Studies differ as to whether drugs like ""'marijuana'' or nutritional deficiencies like zinc or magnesium deficiencies may also be risk factors for developing panic disorder.''Poverty and low education level tend to be associated with anxiety, but it is unclear if those factors cause or are caused by anxiety. While some statistics suggest that disadvantaged ethnic minorities tend to suffer from internalizing disorders like panic disorder less often than the majority population in the United States, other research shows that may be the result of differences in how ethnic groups interpret and discuss signs and symptoms of intense fright, like panic attacks. Also, panic and other anxiety disorders are thought to persist more for some ethnic minorities in the United States. Difficulties the examiner may have in appropriately recognizing and understanding ethnic differences in symptom expression is also thought to play a role in ethnic differences in the reported frequency of panic and other internalizing disorders.''Psychologically, people who develop panic attacks or another anxiety disorder are more likely to have a history of what is called anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity is the tendency for a person to fear that anxiety-related bodily sensations (like brief ''chest pain'' or stomach upset) have dire personal consequences (for example, believing that it automatically means their heart will stop or they will throw up, respectively).''From a social standpoint, a risk factor for developing panic disorder as an adolescent or adult is a history of being physically or sexually abused as a child. This is even more the case for panic disorder when compared to other anxiety disorders. Often, the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, another major life ''stress'', or perhaps medications that increase activity in the part of the brain involved in fear reactions.' "
What are the signs of a panic attack?,"'As described in the first example above, the symptoms of a panic attack develop suddenly, without any apparent cause. They may include physical and emotional symptoms like''Although how long a panic attack lasts can vary greatly, its duration is typically more than 10 minutes. A panic is one of the most distressing conditions that a person can endure, and its symptoms can closely mimic those of a ''heart attack''. Typically, most people who have one panic attack will have others, and when someone has repeated attacks with no other apparent physical or emotional cause and it negatively changes their behavior due to the attacks or feels severe anxiety about having another attack, he or she is said to have panic disorder. A number of other emotional problems can have panic attacks as a symptom. Some of these illnesses include ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', ''schizophrenia'', and intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol and certain other drugs of abuse.''Some medical conditions, like thyroid abnormalities and ''anemia'', as well as certain medications, can produce severe anxiety. Examples of such medications include ''stimulants'' like ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') or amphetamine salts (''Adderall''), ''diabetes medications'' like ''metformin'' (''Glucophage'') and ''insulin'', antimalarial medications like quinine, as well as ''corticosteroid'' withdrawal, such as withdrawal from ''dexamethasone'' (Decadron).''As individuals with panic disorder seem to be at higher risk of having a heart valve abnormality called ''mitral valve prolapse'' (''MVP''), this possibility should be investigated by a doctor since MVP may dictate the need for special precautions when the individual is being treated for any dental problem. While the development of panic attacks has been attributed to the use of food additives like ''aspartame'', alone or in combination with food dyes, more research is needed to better understand the role such substances may have on this disorder.''Anxiety attacks that occur while sleeping, also called ''nocturnal'' panic attacks, occur less often than panic attacks during the daytime but affect about 40%-70% of those who suffer from daytime panic attacks. This symptom is also important because people who suffer from panic symptoms during ''sleep'' tend to have more respiratory distress associated with their panic. They also tend to experience more symptoms of ''depression'' and other psychiatric disorders compared to people who do not have panic attacks at night.''Nocturnal panic attacks tend to cause sufferers to wake suddenly from ''sleep'' in a state of sudden fear or dread for no apparent reason. In contrast to people with ''sleep apnea'' and other ''sleep disorders'', sufferers of nocturnal panic can have all the other symptoms of a panic attack. The duration of nocturnal panic attacks tends to be less than 10 minutes, but it can take much longer to fully calm down for those who experience them.''While panic disorder in adolescents tends to have similar symptoms as in adults, symptoms of this condition in younger children are less likely to include the thought-based or so-called cognitive aspects. Specifically, teenagers are more likely to feel unreal or as if they are functioning in a dream-like state (derealization) or be frightened of going crazy or of dying.''Symptoms of panic attacks in women tend to include more avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, more frequent recurrence, and more often result in the use of medical care compared to ''panic attack symptoms'' in men. The frequency of panic attacks may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged during ''pregnancy''.'   racing or pounding heartbeat (palpitations); chest pains; stomach upset; dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea; hyperventilation; difficulty breathing, a sense of feeling smothered; a choking sensation; hand tingling or numbness; hot flashes/sweating or cold flashes/chills; trembling and shaking; dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions like a feeling of detachment; intense fear of terror, a sense that something unimaginably terrible is about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it; a need to escape; worrying about not knowing how to control their symptoms, leading to them doing something embarrassing; fear of dying."
How is a panic disorder diagnosed?,"'A variety of medical and mental health professionals are qualified to assess and treat ''panic disorders''. From purely medical professionals like primary care doctors, emergency room physicians to practitioners with mental health training like psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, a variety of health care providers may be involved in the care of panic disorder sufferers.''Some practitioners will administer a self-test of screening questions to people whom they suspect may be suffering from panic disorder. In addition to looking for symptoms of repeated panic attacks using what is described in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'""), asking detailed questions about the sufferer's history and conducting a mental-status examination, mental health professionals will explore the possibility that the individual's symptoms are caused by another emotional illness instead of or in addition to the diagnosis of panic disorder.""'For example, people with an ''addiction'' often experience panic attacks, but those symptom characteristics generally only occur when the person is either intoxicated or withdrawing from the substance. Someone who has ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'') may have panic attacks when reminded of ''trauma'' they experienced and in a person with ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', panic attacks may be triggered by their being unable to perform a compulsive behavior.''The practitioner will also likely ensure that a physical examination and any other appropriate medical tests have been done recently to explore whether there is any medical problem that could be contributing to the occurrence of panic attacks. That is particularly important since many medical conditions may have panic attacks as a symptom and therefore require that the underlying medical condition be treated in order to alleviate the associated anxiety. Examples of that include the need for treatment with antibiotics for infections like ''Lyme disease'' or vitamin ''supplements'' to address certain forms of ''anemia''.' "
What is the best treatment for panic attacks? Are there medications for panic attacks?,"'As the result of years of research, there are a variety of treatments available to help people who suffer from panic attacks learn how to control the symptoms. This includes several effective medical treatments, and specific forms of psychotherapy.''In terms of medications, specific members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI), and the ''benzodiazepine'' families of medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effective treatment of panic disorder.''Examples of anti-anxiety medications include''SSRIs''SSNRIs''Benzodiazepines''Although ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax'') is often used to treat panic attacks, its short duration of action can sometimes result in having to take it several times per day. Medications from the ''beta-blocker'' family (for example, ''propranolol'' [''Inderal'']) are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms, like racing heart rate associated with a panic attack.''Some individuals who suffer from severe panic attacks may benefit from treatment with ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), which was initially found to treat ''seizures'', or benefit from a neuroleptic medication like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), or lurasidone (''Latuda'').''Before SSRIs and SSNRIs became available, medications from the group known as the ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs) were often used to address panic disorder. Although TCAs have been found to be equally effective in treating panic attacks, SSRIs and SSNRIs have been proven to be safer and better tolerated. Therefore TCAs are used much less often than they were previously.''When used in the appropriate person with close monitoring, medications can be quite effective as part of treatment for panic disorder. However, as anything that is ingested carries a risk of side effects, it is important for the individual who has panic attacks to work closely with the prescribing health care professional to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention and, if so, which medication should be administered. The person being treated should be closely monitored for the possibility of side effects that can vary from minor to severe, and in some cases, even be life-threatening.''Due to the possible risks to the fetus of a mother being treated for panic attacks with medication, psychotherapy should be the first treatment tried when possible during pregnancy and the risk of medication treatment should be weighed against the risk of continued panic attacks in regard to the impact of a developing fetus.''For people who may be wondering how to avoid panic attacks using treatment without prescribed medication, natural remedies may be an option. While herbal ''supplements'' that contain ''kava'' have been found to be helpful for some people with mild to moderate panic disorder, the research data is still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend treatment with other natural remedies like ''valerian'' or passionflower. Also, care should be taken when taking any ''dietary supplements'', since supplements are not regulated in terms of quality, content, or effectiveness.''The psychotherapy component of treatment for panic disorder is at least as important as medication. In fact, research shows that psychotherapy alone or the combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment are more effective than medication alone in the long-term management of panic attacks. In overcoming anxiety, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' is widely accepted as an effective form of psychotherapy treatment, for both adults and children.''This form of psychotherapy seeks to help those with panic disorder identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce panic symptoms and can be done either individually, in group therapy, in partner-assisted therapy, and even over the Internet. Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease anxiety include relaxation techniques (like breathing techniques or guided imagery) and gradually increasing exposure to situations that may have previously triggered anxiety in the panic disorder sufferer.''Helping the person with anxiety understand how to handle the emotional forces that may have contributed to developing symptoms (panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy) has also been found to be effective in teaching an individual with panic disorder how to prevent an anxiety attack or how to calm down in order to decrease or stop a panic attack once it starts.''There are also things that people with panic disorder can do to learn how to handle it and to make treatment more effective. Since substances like drinking alcohol or ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'', or using illicit drugs can worsen panic attacks, those things should be avoided. Other tips to prevent or manage panic attacks include engaging in aerobic ''exercise'' and stress-management techniques like deep breathing, ''massage'' therapy, and ''yoga'', since these self-help activities have also been found to help decrease the frequency and severity of panic attacks.''Although many people use home remedies like breathing into a paper bag when afflicted by the hyperventilation that can be associated with panic, the benefit received may be the result of the individual believing it will remedy the symptoms (placebo effect). Also, breathing into a paper bag when one is already having trouble breathing can make matters worse when the hyperventilation is the result of conditions of oxygen deprivation, like an ''asthma attack'' or a heart attack.''People with panic disorder may also need treatment for other emotional problems. ''Depression'' has often been associated with panic disorder, as have alcohol and ''drug abuse''. Fortunately, with proper treatment, these problems associated with panic disorder can be overcome effectively, just like panic disorder itself.''Sadly, many people with panic attacks do not seek or receive appropriate treatment.'   fluoxetine (Prozac) sertraline (Zoloft) paroxetine (Paxil) escitalopram (Lexapro) citalopram (Celexa) vortioxetine (Brintellix) vilazodone (Viibryd) duloxetine (Cymbalta)  venlafaxine (Effexor)  desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)  levomilnacipran (Fetzima)  clonazepam (Klonopin)   lorazepam (Ativan) "
What are complications of untreated panic attacks?,"'Without treatment, panic attacks tend to occur repeatedly for months or years. While they typically begin in young adulthood, the symptoms may arise earlier or later in life in some people.''Complications, which are symptoms that can develop as a result of continued panic attacks and develop into other mental illnesses, may include specific irrational fears (''phobias''), especially of leaving home (agoraphobia) and avoidance of social situations. Other possible complications can include depression, work or school problems, ''suicidal'' thoughts or actions, financial problems, and alcohol or other substance abuse.''For children and adolescents, panic disorder can even interfere with normal development. Panic disorder and other anxiety disorders also predispose sufferers to developing heart or gastrointestinal diseases, ''high blood pressure'' or ''diabetes'', having more severe symptoms if they have a respiratory disease, and of dying prematurely.'""If left untreated, anxiety may worsen to the point at which the person's life is seriously affected by panic attacks and by attempts to avoid or conceal them. In fact, many people have had problems with friends and family, failed in school, and/or lost jobs while struggling to cope with this condition. There may be periods of spontaneous improvement in the episodes, but panic attacks do not usually go away unless the person receives treatments designed specifically to help people with these symptoms."" "
What is the prognosis for panic disorder?,"'Often, a combination of psychotherapy and medications produces good results in the treatment of panic disorder. Improvement is usually noticed in about two to three months. Thus, appropriate treatment for panic disorder can prevent panic attacks or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency, bringing significant relief to 70%-90% of people with the illness. More than 18% of people who are assessed but not treated for this condition tend to relapse in less than two years.''As these statistics indicate, access to appropriate mental health care is key to a positive prognosis for people who suffer from panic attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to alleviate the well documented economic and racial disparities that exist in having and using access to care. Combating other social disparities, like educational, employment, housing, and criminal justice, is also seen as being important to improving the prognosis for recovering from panic attacks and other health problems.' "
How can I prevent or stop a panic attack?,"'Effective means of panic attack ''prevention'' for people who have had them include avoiding triggers for panic, including''Getting adequate sleep and engaging in stress-reducing activities like yoga or other ''exercise'' can also help avoid the occurrence of panic attacks.' alcohol or stimulants likecaffeine,diet pills, orcocaine. caffeine, diet pills, or cocaine."

According to one theory of panic disorder, the body\'s normal ""alarm system,"" also described as the body\'s fight or flight system, the set of mental and physical mechanisms that allows a person to respond to a threat, tends to be triggered when there is no danger.'""Scientists don't know specifically why this happens or why some people are more susceptible to the problem than others. Panic disorder has been found to run in families, and this may mean that inheritance (genetics) plays a role in determining who will develop the condition. However, many people who have no family history of the disorder develop it. Studies differ as to whether drugs like ""'marijuana'' or nutritional deficiencies like zinc or magnesium deficiencies may also be risk factors for developing panic disorder.''Poverty and low education level tend to be associated with anxiety, but it is unclear if those factors cause or are caused by anxiety. While some statistics suggest that disadvantaged ethnic minorities tend to suffer from internalizing disorders like panic disorder less often than the majority population in the United States, other research shows that may be the result of differences in how ethnic groups interpret and discuss signs and symptoms of intense fright, like panic attacks. Also, panic and other anxiety disorders are thought to persist more for some ethnic minorities in the United States. Difficulties the examiner may have in appropriately recognizing and understanding ethnic differences in symptom expression is also thought to play a role in ethnic differences in the reported frequency of panic and other internalizing disorders.''Psychologically, people who develop panic attacks or another anxiety disorder are more likely to have a history of what is called anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity is the tendency for a person to fear that anxiety-related bodily sensations (like brief ''chest pain'' or stomach upset) have dire personal consequences (for example, believing that it automatically means their heart will stop or they will throw up, respectively).''From a social standpoint, a risk factor for developing panic disorder as an adolescent or adult is a history of being physically or sexually abused as a child. This is even more the case for panic disorder when compared to other anxiety disorders. Often, the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, another major life ''stress'', or perhaps medications that increase activity in the part of the brain involved in fear reactions.' "
What are the signs of a panic attack?,"'As described in the first example above, the symptoms of a panic attack develop suddenly, without any apparent cause. They may include physical and emotional symptoms like''Although how long a panic attack lasts can vary greatly, its duration is typically more than 10 minutes. A panic is one of the most distressing conditions that a person can endure, and its symptoms can closely mimic those of a ''heart attack''. Typically, most people who have one panic attack will have others, and when someone has repeated attacks with no other apparent physical or emotional cause and it negatively changes their behavior due to the attacks or feels severe anxiety about having another attack, he or she is said to have panic disorder. A number of other emotional problems can have panic attacks as a symptom. Some of these illnesses include ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', ''schizophrenia'', and intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol and certain other drugs of abuse.''Some medical conditions, like thyroid abnormalities and ''anemia'', as well as certain medications, can produce severe anxiety. Examples of such medications include ''stimulants'' like ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') or amphetamine salts (''Adderall''), ''diabetes medications'' like ''metformin'' (''Glucophage'') and ''insulin'', antimalarial medications like quinine, as well as ''corticosteroid'' withdrawal, such as withdrawal from ''dexamethasone'' (Decadron).''As individuals with panic disorder seem to be at higher risk of having a heart valve abnormality called ''mitral valve prolapse'' (''MVP''), this possibility should be investigated by a doctor since MVP may dictate the need for special precautions when the individual is being treated for any dental problem. While the development of panic attacks has been attributed to the use of food additives like ''aspartame'', alone or in combination with food dyes, more research is needed to better understand the role such substances may have on this disorder.''Anxiety attacks that occur while sleeping, also called ''nocturnal'' panic attacks, occur less often than panic attacks during the daytime but affect about 40%-70% of those who suffer from daytime panic attacks. This symptom is also important because people who suffer from panic symptoms during ''sleep'' tend to have more respiratory distress associated with their panic. They also tend to experience more symptoms of ''depression'' and other psychiatric disorders compared to people who do not have panic attacks at night.''Nocturnal panic attacks tend to cause sufferers to wake suddenly from ''sleep'' in a state of sudden fear or dread for no apparent reason. In contrast to people with ''sleep apnea'' and other ''sleep disorders'', sufferers of nocturnal panic can have all the other symptoms of a panic attack. The duration of nocturnal panic attacks tends to be less than 10 minutes, but it can take much longer to fully calm down for those who experience them.''While panic disorder in adolescents tends to have similar symptoms as in adults, symptoms of this condition in younger children are less likely to include the thought-based or so-called cognitive aspects. Specifically, teenagers are more likely to feel unreal or as if they are functioning in a dream-like state (derealization) or be frightened of going crazy or of dying.''Symptoms of panic attacks in women tend to include more avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, more frequent recurrence, and more often result in the use of medical care compared to ''panic attack symptoms'' in men. The frequency of panic attacks may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged during ''pregnancy''.'   racing or pounding heartbeat (palpitations); chest pains; stomach upset; dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea; hyperventilation; difficulty breathing, a sense of feeling smothered; a choking sensation; hand tingling or numbness; hot flashes/sweating or cold flashes/chills; trembling and shaking; dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions like a feeling of detachment; intense fear of terror, a sense that something unimaginably terrible is about to occur and one is powerless to prevent it; a need to escape; worrying about not knowing how to control their symptoms, leading to them doing something embarrassing; fear of dying."
How is a panic disorder diagnosed?,"'A variety of medical and mental health professionals are qualified to assess and treat ''panic disorders''. From purely medical professionals like primary care doctors, emergency room physicians to practitioners with mental health training like psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, a variety of health care providers may be involved in the care of panic disorder sufferers.''Some practitioners will administer a self-test of screening questions to people whom they suspect may be suffering from panic disorder. In addition to looking for symptoms of repeated panic attacks using what is described in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'""), asking detailed questions about the sufferer's history and conducting a mental-status examination, mental health professionals will explore the possibility that the individual's symptoms are caused by another emotional illness instead of or in addition to the diagnosis of panic disorder.""'For example, people with an ''addiction'' often experience panic attacks, but those symptom characteristics generally only occur when the person is either intoxicated or withdrawing from the substance. Someone who has ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'') may have panic attacks when reminded of ''trauma'' they experienced and in a person with ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', panic attacks may be triggered by their being unable to perform a compulsive behavior.''The practitioner will also likely ensure that a physical examination and any other appropriate medical tests have been done recently to explore whether there is any medical problem that could be contributing to the occurrence of panic attacks. That is particularly important since many medical conditions may have panic attacks as a symptom and therefore require that the underlying medical condition be treated in order to alleviate the associated anxiety. Examples of that include the need for treatment with antibiotics for infections like ''Lyme disease'' or vitamin ''supplements'' to address certain forms of ''anemia''.' "
What is the best treatment for panic attacks? Are there medications for panic attacks?,"'As the result of years of research, there are a variety of treatments available to help people who suffer from panic attacks learn how to control the symptoms. This includes several effective medical treatments, and specific forms of psychotherapy.''In terms of medications, specific members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI), and the ''benzodiazepine'' families of medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effective treatment of panic disorder.''Examples of anti-anxiety medications include''SSRIs''SSNRIs''Benzodiazepines''Although ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax'') is often used to treat panic attacks, its short duration of action can sometimes result in having to take it several times per day. Medications from the ''beta-blocker'' family (for example, ''propranolol'' [''Inderal'']) are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms, like racing heart rate associated with a panic attack.''Some individuals who suffer from severe panic attacks may benefit from treatment with ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), which was initially found to treat ''seizures'', or benefit from a neuroleptic medication like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), or lurasidone (''Latuda'').''Before SSRIs and SSNRIs became available, medications from the group known as the ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs) were often used to address panic disorder. Although TCAs have been found to be equally effective in treating panic attacks, SSRIs and SSNRIs have been proven to be safer and better tolerated. Therefore TCAs are used much less often than they were previously.''When used in the appropriate person with close monitoring, medications can be quite effective as part of treatment for panic disorder. However, as anything that is ingested carries a risk of side effects, it is important for the individual who has panic attacks to work closely with the prescribing health care professional to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention and, if so, which medication should be administered. The person being treated should be closely monitored for the possibility of side effects that can vary from minor to severe, and in some cases, even be life-threatening.''Due to the possible risks to the fetus of a mother being treated for panic attacks with medication, psychotherapy should be the first treatment tried when possible during pregnancy and the risk of medication treatment should be weighed against the risk of continued panic attacks in regard to the impact of a developing fetus.''For people who may be wondering how to avoid panic attacks using treatment without prescribed medication, natural remedies may be an option. While herbal ''supplements'' that contain ''kava'' have been found to be helpful for some people with mild to moderate panic disorder, the research data is still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend treatment with other natural remedies like ''valerian'' or passionflower. Also, care should be taken when taking any ''dietary supplements'', since supplements are not regulated in terms of quality, content, or effectiveness.''The psychotherapy component of treatment for panic disorder is at least as important as medication. In fact, research shows that psychotherapy alone or the combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment are more effective than medication alone in the long-term management of panic attacks. In overcoming anxiety, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' is widely accepted as an effective form of psychotherapy treatment, for both adults and children.''This form of psychotherapy seeks to help those with panic disorder identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce panic symptoms and can be done either individually, in group therapy, in partner-assisted therapy, and even over the Internet. Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease anxiety include relaxation techniques (like breathing techniques or guided imagery) and gradually increasing exposure to situations that may have previously triggered anxiety in the panic disorder sufferer.''Helping the person with anxiety understand how to handle the emotional forces that may have contributed to developing symptoms (panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy) has also been found to be effective in teaching an individual with panic disorder how to prevent an anxiety attack or how to calm down in order to decrease or stop a panic attack once it starts.''There are also things that people with panic disorder can do to learn how to handle it and to make treatment more effective. Since substances like drinking alcohol or ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'', or using illicit drugs can worsen panic attacks, those things should be avoided. Other tips to prevent or manage panic attacks include engaging in aerobic ''exercise'' and stress-management techniques like deep breathing, ''massage'' therapy, and ''yoga'', since these self-help activities have also been found to help decrease the frequency and severity of panic attacks.''Although many people use home remedies like breathing into a paper bag when afflicted by the hyperventilation that can be associated with panic, the benefit received may be the result of the individual believing it will remedy the symptoms (placebo effect). Also, breathing into a paper bag when one is already having trouble breathing can make matters worse when the hyperventilation is the result of conditions of oxygen deprivation, like an ''asthma attack'' or a heart attack.''People with panic disorder may also need treatment for other emotional problems. ''Depression'' has often been associated with panic disorder, as have alcohol and ''drug abuse''. Fortunately, with proper treatment, these problems associated with panic disorder can be overcome effectively, just like panic disorder itself.''Sadly, many people with panic attacks do not seek or receive appropriate treatment.'   fluoxetine (Prozac) sertraline (Zoloft) paroxetine (Paxil) escitalopram (Lexapro) citalopram (Celexa) vortioxetine (Brintellix) vilazodone (Viibryd) duloxetine (Cymbalta)  venlafaxine (Effexor)  desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)  levomilnacipran (Fetzima)  clonazepam (Klonopin)   lorazepam (Ativan) "
What are complications of untreated panic attacks?,"'Without treatment, panic attacks tend to occur repeatedly for months or years. While they typically begin in young adulthood, the symptoms may arise earlier or later in life in some people.''Complications, which are symptoms that can develop as a result of continued panic attacks and develop into other mental illnesses, may include specific irrational fears (''phobias''), especially of leaving home (agoraphobia) and avoidance of social situations. Other possible complications can include depression, work or school problems, ''suicidal'' thoughts or actions, financial problems, and alcohol or other substance abuse.''For children and adolescents, panic disorder can even interfere with normal development. Panic disorder and other anxiety disorders also predispose sufferers to developing heart or gastrointestinal diseases, ''high blood pressure'' or ''diabetes'', having more severe symptoms if they have a respiratory disease, and of dying prematurely.'""If left untreated, anxiety may worsen to the point at which the person's life is seriously affected by panic attacks and by attempts to avoid or conceal them. In fact, many people have had problems with friends and family, failed in school, and/or lost jobs while struggling to cope with this condition. There may be periods of spontaneous improvement in the episodes, but panic attacks do not usually go away unless the person receives treatments designed specifically to help people with these symptoms."" "
What is the prognosis for panic disorder?,"'Often, a combination of psychotherapy and medications produces good results in the treatment of panic disorder. Improvement is usually noticed in about two to three months. Thus, appropriate treatment for panic disorder can prevent panic attacks or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency, bringing significant relief to 70%-90% of people with the illness. More than 18% of people who are assessed but not treated for this condition tend to relapse in less than two years.''As these statistics indicate, access to appropriate mental health care is key to a positive prognosis for people who suffer from panic attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to alleviate the well documented economic and racial disparities that exist in having and using access to care. Combating other social disparities, like educational, employment, housing, and criminal justice, is also seen as being important to improving the prognosis for recovering from panic attacks and other health problems.' "
How can I prevent or stop a panic attack?,"'Effective means of panic attack ''prevention'' for people who have had them include avoiding triggers for panic, including''Getting adequate sleep and engaging in stress-reducing activities like yoga or other ''exercise'' can also help avoid the occurrence of panic attacks.' alcohol or stimulants likecaffeine,diet pills, orcocaine. caffeine, diet pills, or cocaine."

What is Weber-Christian disease? What are the risk factors for this disease?,"'Weber-Christian disease is an uncommon inflammatory disease of the fatty tissues of the body. Weber-Christian disease is also referred to as idiopathic lobular ''panniculitis'' (ILP) and relapsing febrile nodular panniculitis syndrome.''The term Weber-Christian often refers to a group of diseases that involve the deep fat. These disorders first appear on the skin as reddish, tender nodules. Mostly, Weber-Christian describes cases of recurring inflammation of special sections of fat called lobules. The exact cause of Weber-Christian panniculitis is unknown. The disorder is frequently associated with systemic symptoms such as ''fever'' and body aches.''Weber-Christian disease is most commonly seen in females 30-60 years of age. It can occur in both sexes, in all ages, and rarely in infants. There are no other known risk factors.''Usually, both sides of the body are affected, and the thighs and lower legs are the most frequent areas. The inflamed areas can lose their blood supply, the skin can actually die in the area, ooze yellowish drainage, and become infected. Scarring is common.''The appearance of the skin symptoms are usually accompanied by ''fever'' and malaise (feeling poorly). The skin lumps may vary in size but are usually small, the size of two to three fingertips or about 1-2 cm in size. The skin lumps may gradually flatten, soften, and start to decrease over several weeks. Frequently, the areas heal with a brownish or tan discoloration and leave a sunken ''scar'' from the underlying fat necrosis. Less commonly, the skin discoloration may take weeks to months to fade away completely and leave no scar.' "
What is panniculitis?,"'The tissue layer under the skin (''epidermis'' and dermis) is called the subcutaneous fat or panniculus.  This subcutaneous tissue is very important in temperature regulation and protective insulation of the body. Inflammation of this essential layer of fatty tissue is called panniculitis. In panniculitis, the overlying skin typically appears as red or purplish lumps.' "
What are other symptoms of Weber-Christian disease?,"'Weber-Christian disease can also cause symptoms other than in the skin,such as fever, ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''weight loss'', and ''joint pain''.Occasionally, inflammation occurs in other organs of the body to cause''heart'', lung, kidney, ''liver'', and/or spleen problems. Liver involvement may first cause ''abdominal pain''. The skin symptoms provide perhaps the most important clue to the diagnosis of Weber-Christian syndrome. Overall, symptoms with this syndrome may come and go, and relapses are common.'  "
What causes Weber-Christian disease?,'The cause of Weber-Christian disease or idiopathic lobular panniculitis is not known. ''Idiopathic'' means unknown cause. A misdirected immune reaction may play a role. The cause may be related to an abnormal bodily response to the normal inflammation.' 
How is Weber-Christian disease diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis is made usually by taking a piece of tissue (biopsy) and examining it under a microscope. There is inflammation of the affected fatty lobules (central part of the fat) with increased numbers of white blood cells around the fat and sometimes degeneration or death of fat cells called necrosis.''Laboratory tests using a simple blood draw may be helpful as extra information to suggest inflammation when Weber-Christian disease is suspected. There is no single lab test that completely defines this disease. Abnormal tests such as a highly elevated erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', also called ""sed rate"" or ESR, may be useful. Additionally, mildly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) on a complete blood cell count (''CBC'') may be found.''Normal lab tests, including serum and urine amylase and lipase, help to distinguish Weber-Christian from other diseases of the fat caused by ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). A normal alpha-1 ''antitrypsin'' level helps to differentiate Weber-Christian disease from a separate fatty inflammatory disease (panniculitis) caused by ''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency''.'  "
What is the prognosis of Weber-Christian disease?,"'The prognosis or long-term outlook is very different for each patient with Weber-Christian disease and depends on the severity of organ involvement. Some patients have mild, intermittent, annoying symptoms, while in others Weber-Christian disease can be fatal. After several years of symptoms, Weber-Christian disease may go away permanently (remission).' "
What is the treatment for Weber-Christian disease?,"'There is no cure or uniformly effective treatment that works for everyone with Weber-Christian  disease. Possible treatments include oral medications that alter the immune-system reaction and decrease overall inflammation. Some patients have had improvement with medications including ''chloroquine'', ''thalidomide'', ''cyclophosphamide'', ''tetracycline'', ''cyclosporine'', ''azathioprine'', ''prednisone'', and a host of nonsteroidal medications like ''ibuprofen'' and ''indomethacin''.''Accompanying treatments for the symptoms may include additional oral ''pain'' medications as well as topical salves to treat and prevent local skin infections.'' Overall, when internal organs are inflamed, medicines directed toward the underlying inflammation are considered. In summary, treatment for Weber-Christian disease is nonspecific, and antiinflammatory therapy may not be fully effective for everyone with the disease.'  "
Facts you should know about Pap smears,"  A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and essentially painless screening test (procedure) for cancer or precancer of the uterine cervix. Cells collected from a woman's cervix during a pelvic exam are spread on a microscope slide for examination. The cells are evaluated for abnormalities, specifically for pre- cancerous and cancerous changes. A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light vaginal bleeding) immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal. Cervical cancer screening is recommended every 3 years for women aged 21-65. The Pap smear is analyzed according to a uniform standardized system known as the Bethesda System. An abnormal Pap smear may show precancerous changes that can be treated at an early stage, before cancer develops. A recording of the woman's menstruation status and whether and when she had abnormal Pap smears previously is essential to the reader of the current Pap smear. Up to 80% of women diagnosed with invasive cancer of the cervix have not had a Pap smear in the past 5 years. Cancer of the cervix is largely a preventable disease."
What is a Pap smear procedure?,"'A Pap smear (Papanicolau smear; also known as the Pap test) is a screening test for ''cervical cancer'"". The test itself involves collection of a sample of cells from a woman's cervix (the end of the uterus that extends into the vagina) during a routine pelvic exam. The cells are placed on a glass slide and stained with a substance known as Papanicolau stain. The stained cells are then examined under a microscope to look for pre-""'malignant'' (before-cancer) or malignant (cancer) changes.''A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and relatively painless screening test. Its ''specificity'','' ''which means its ability to avoid classifying a normal smear as abnormal (a ""false positive"" result), while very good, is not perfect. The ''sensitivity'' of a Pap smear, which means its ability to detect every single abnormality, while good, also is not perfect, and some ""false negative"" results (in which abnormalities are present but not detected by the test) will occur. Thus, a few women develop ''cervical cancer'' despite having regular Pap screening.''In the vast majority of cases, a Pap test does identify minor cellular abnormalities before they have had a chance to become malignant, and at a point when the condition is most easily treatable. The Pap smear is not intended to detect other forms of cancer such as those of the ovary, vagina, or uterus. Cancer of these organs may be discovered during the course of the gynecologic (pelvic) exam, which usually is done at the same time as the Pap smear.' "
Who should have a Pap smear?,"'Guidelines have been developed for cervical cancer screening that address the frequency with which women should have Pap smears. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) both recommend that all women receive cervical cancer screening every 3 years between the ages of 21 and 65. A Pap smear is the typical screening procedure, but when a Pap smear is combined with a test for ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'', the known cause of cervical ''cancers''), screening every 5 years is acceptable for women aged 30 and above.''Pregnancy'' does not prevent a woman from having a Pap smear, therefore, Pap smears can be safely done during pregnancy.''Pap smear testing is not indicated for women who have had a ''hysterectomy'' (with removal of the cervix) for benign conditions. Women who have had a hysterectomy in which the cervix is not removed, called subtotal hysterectomy, should continue screening following the same guidelines as women who have not had a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the risks of having a Pap smear?,"'There are absolutely no known medical risks associated with Pap smear screening. (However, there are medical risks from not having a Pap smear.) A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light ''vaginal bleeding'') immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal.' "
What kind of doctor performs a Pap test?,"'Pap testing is performed by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) or by primary care physicians including family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, or pediatricians. Pap smears can also be performed by other specially trained health-care professionals including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives.' "
How do medical professionals perform a Pap smear?,"""With the woman positioned on her back, the health-care professional will often first examine the outside of the patient's genital and rectal areas, including the urethra (the opening where urine leaves the body), to assure that they look normal.""'A bimanual (both hands) pelvic exam usually follows the collection of the two samples for the Pap smear. The bimanual examination involves the physician or health-care professional inserting two fingers of one hand inside the vaginal canal while feeling the ovaries and uterus with the other hand on top of the abdomen (belly).' A speculum is then inserted into the vaginal area (the birth canal). (A speculum is an instrument that allows the vagina and the cervix to be viewed and examined.) A small brush or swab is inserted into the opening of the cervix and twirled around to collect a sample of cells. A second sample is also collected on the surface of the cervix as part of the Pap smear The samples are placed in a solution from which cells are isolated and used to produce slides for laboratory evaluation."
How will I find out the results of my Pap smear?,"""The results of the Pap smear are usually available within one to two weeks. At the end of Pap smear testing, each woman should ask how she should expect to be informed about the results of her Pap smear. If a woman has not learned of her results after a month, she should contact her health-care professional's office."" "
What is an abnormal Pap smear?,"'An abnormal Pap smear shows cancer or precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix. It is especially important to identify abnormal cells in the early stages, because treatment can be carried out to remove the abnormal cells. The section below entitled ""How is a Pap smear read and analyzed"" contains the specific terminology used in the report for an abnormal Pap smear. '  "
How do medical professionals analyze a Pap smear?,"'Pap smear analysis and reports are all based on a medical terminology system called The Bethesda System. The system was developed (at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland) to encourage all medical professionals analyzing Pap smears to use the same reporting system. Standardization reduces the possibility that different laboratories might report different results for the same smear.''The Bethesda System was the outcome of a National Cancer Institute workshop that was held in 1988 in an effort to standardize Pap smear reports. In 2001, the guidelines were revised and improved. Acceptance of the Bethesda reporting system in the United States is virtually universal.''The major categories for abnormal Pap smears reported in the Bethesda Systems are as follows (described in further detail in the ""What are the possible recommendations for follow-up after a Pap smear?"" section):''The word ""''squamous''"" describes the thin, flat cells that lie on the surface of the cervix. ""Intraepithelial"" indicates that the surface layer of cells is affected. A ""lesion"" means that abnormal tissue is present.''An abnormal or inadequate Pap smear report may contain the following diagnoses.''There is a particular area inside the opening of the cervix where the cells lining the vagina change to the cells that characterize the inside of the cervix (endocervical cells). This is called the ""transition zone"". The Pap smear sample from the cervical opening attempts to sample these cells. However, this area may be so far up inside the cervix that the Pap smear sampling instrument simply cannot reach that high. Sometimes, the transition zone may be less accessible to the Pap brush or the cervical opening cannot be seen well enough to obtain an adequate sample.'""If severe inflammation is present, its cause(s) are investigated. The physician's goals are to identify the cause of inflammation and to treat and resolve the condition, if possible. Untreated inflammation can have consequences for the woman as well as her sexual partner(s).""'The vaginal irritation may be caused by a lack of estrogen, such as occurs after ''menopause'' when the ovaries stop producing this hormone. This lack of estrogen tends to make the vaginal walls irritated and red. If a woman has this condition and it is related to an estrogen deficiency (called ""atrophic ''vaginitis''"" and usually described on the Pap smear report as ""atrophic changes""), her physician may recommend a trial of topical (locally- applied) vaginal estrogen (cream, vaginal estrogen tablets, vaginal estrogen ring) to heal the inflammation. The Pap smear is then repeated.''Sometimes, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (also called ""ASC-US""), is the Pap report. This is the mildest form of cellular abnormality on the spectrum of cells ranging from normal to cancerous. ASC-US means that the cells appear ''abnormal, but are not malignant''.''""Of undetermined significance"" means that the atypical-appearing cells may be the end result of a number of different types of injuries to the cervix. For example, the human papilloma virus (''HPV'') could be the cause of ASC-US. Most instances of ASC-US (80%-90%) resolve spontaneously (by themselves without specific medical intervention or treatment).''A reading of LSIL is a ''reason for immediate further investigation'' because it is more abnormal than ASC-US. Fifteen to 30% of women who have this abnormality on Pap testing will have a more serious abnormality on biopsy of the cervix. Thus, all women with LSIL are recommended to undergo ''colposcopy'' (an examination of the cervix using a special visualizing scope, often accompanied by a ''cervical biopsy'', see below). Even LSIL spontaneously returns to normal without therapy in many women within several months.''The most severe cellular abnormality that is ''not actually cancer'' is high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). A finding of HSIL unquestionably requires prompt evaluation and treatment.' ASC-US: This abbreviation stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. LSIL: This abbreviation stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade I. HSIL: This abbreviation stands for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade II, CIN grade III, or CIS. ASC-H: This means atypical cells are present and HSIL cannot be excluded."
What information is included on a Pap smear report?,"'The first items on a Pap smear report are for purposes of identification. The report is expected to have the name of the woman, the name of the pathologist and/or the cytotechnologist who read the smear, the source of the specimen (in this case, the cervix), and the date of the ''last menstrual period'' of the woman.''The Pap smear report should also include the following:' A description of the woman's menstrual status (for example, ""menopausal"" (no longer menstruating) or ""regular menstrual periods"") The woman's relevant medical history (example, ""history of genital warts"")  The number of slides (either one or two, depending on the health care 
professional's routine practice)  A description of the specimen adequacy (whether the sample is satisfactory for interpretation) The final diagnosis (for example, ""within normal limits"")  The recommendation for follow-up (for example, ""recommend routine follow-up"" or ""recommend repeat smear"")"
Why is a woman's menstrual status important for the Pap smear?,"""A woman who is menstruating sheds cells from the lining of her uterus called endometrial cells. If these cells are seen on the Pap smear of a menstruating woman, the report may note that these cells are present. This is normal if the Pap test was done around the time of the woman's ""'menstrual period''. The comment that these cells are ""cytologically benign"" means that they do not appear to be malignant (cancerous) cells.''However, if a woman is menopausal (no longer menstruating) she would not be expected to be shedding cells from the uterine lining. Therefore, endometrial cells on a Pap report might be indicative of an abnormal thickening of the ''endometrium'', the lining of the uterus. The Pap smear is not specifically designed to detect such an abnormality. Nonetheless, if these cells are noted in a non-menstruating woman, her doctor should attempt to determine the cause of the shedding of the endometrial cells.''Sometimes, the cause is endometrial hyperplasia, a precancerous condition of the uterine lining, which can be detected by a relatively simple office procedure called an ''endometrial biopsy''. Sometimes, menopausal ''hormone therapy'"" can cause shedding of endometrial cells that appear on a Pap smear. The pattern of bleeding, the exact type of hormone therapy, and the individual woman's health history are the three components that guide the physician to know whether and what type of further evaluation is necessary.""

What are risk factors for cervical cancer and precancer?,"'A number of risk factors have been identified for the development of cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix.' HPV: The principal risk factor is infection with the genital wart virus, also called the human papillomavirus (HPV), although most women with HPV infection do not get cervical cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are related to HPV infection. Some women are more likely to have abnormal Pap smears than other women. Smoking: One common risk factor for premalignant and malignant changes in the cervix is smoking. Although smoking is associated with many different cancers, many women do not realize that smoking is strongly linked to cervical cancer. Smoking increases the risk of cervical cancer about two to four fold. Weakened immune system: Women whose immune systems are weakened or have become weakened by medications (for example, those taken after an organ transplant) also have a higher risk of precancerous changes in the cervix. Medications: Women whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy also are at increased risk. Other risk factors: Other risk factors for precancerous changes in the 
	cervix, having an abnormal Pap test, having multiple sexual partners, and becoming sexually active at a young age."
Why is a woman's past Pap smear history pertinent?,"'If a woman has had a history of a cellular abnormality on a previous Pap smear, it is important for her to inform the health-care professional performing the current Pap smear. The woman should provide the details of any previous problems and treatments so that this information can be noted on the lab form. The past history of the woman helps the person who is reading (interpreting) the current Pap smear, because a particular abnormality on previous screening alerts the health-care professional to look more carefully for specific findings on the current Pap smear.' "
When might a Pap smear not be adequate for interpretation?,"'It is a requirement that the report comment on the adequacy of the smear sample for Pap analysis. If the sample is inadequate, the report details the reason. Examples of problems that might be listed under ""sample adequacy"" include ""drying artifact"" or ""excessive blood."" These comments refer to factors that the person analyzing the smear feels may have interfered with his or her ability to interpret the sample.''Sometimes, a Pap smear report will read ""unsatisfactory due to excessive inflammation."" Inflammation that is present in the woman\'s cervical area may make it difficult to interpret the Pap smear. Examples of causes of ''inflammation'' might include infections or irritation. Inflammation is a common finding on pap smears. If it is severe, your doctor may want to try to determine the cause of the inflammation. In many cases, a repeat pap smear is recommended to determine if the inflammation has resolved and to obtain a sample that is adequate for interpretation.' "
How do medical professionals make a final Pap smear diagnosis?,"'The final Pap smear diagnosis is based on three determining factors:''The final diagnosis is a short statement that summarizes what the reader has found.'  The patient's history: The reader (the person reading the smear) takes into account the woman's history as noted on the lab request by the clinician performing the smear. Sample adequacy: The reader then decides whether the sample was adequate for interpretation. The presence or absence of cellular abnormalities: The reader then notes whether cellular abnormalities were seen on the slides. If the appearance of the Pap smear does not seem to coincide with the woman's clinical history, a comment may also be made to that effect."
What are the possible recommendations for follow-up after a Pap smear?,"'Once the final diagnosis has been made, the follow-up recommendation informs you what the appropriate next step(s) might be. For example, if the final diagnosis states that the smear was ""within normal limits,"" the appropriate follow-up might be ""recommend routine follow-up.""''An abnormal Pap smear is one in which the laboratory interprets the cellular changes to be different from those normally seen on a healthy cervix. There are a number of possible follow-up scenarios for an abnormal Pap smear.' "
What treatments are available if a Pap smear is abnormal?,"'If a Pap smear is interpreted as abnormal, there are a number of different management and treatment options including colposcopy, conization, cryocauterization, laser therapy, and large-loop excision of the transformation zone.''All of these procedures have essentially the same overall cure rate of over 90%. However, the procedures do vary considerably in a number of other respects and so will be discussed separately.''Colposcopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to take a closer look at the cervix. The colposcope is essentially a magnifying glass for the cervix. For colposcopy to be adequate, the whole cervical lesion, as well as the whole transformation zone (the transition between the vagina-like lining and the uterus-like lining), must be seen.''During colposcopy, the cervix is cleaned and soaked with 3% acetic acid (vinegar). This mild acid not only cleans the surface of the cervix but it also allows cellular abnormalities to show up as white areas (called acetowhite epithelium or acetowhite lesions).''If suspicious areas of cervical tissue are seen during colposcopy, a biopsy (tissue sampling) is often done. The sample is sent to the laboratory for analysis by a pathologist, and the biopsy results determine the next step in the treatment.''The procedure is essentially painless and quite simple, usually taking only several minutes to perform. Generally, the woman is instructed not to have intercourse, ''douche'', or use tampons for about a week afterwards if a biopsy is done. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to colposcopy. Colposcopy can adequately evaluate 90% of women who have abnormal Pap smear results.''Conization allows the entire area of abnormal tissue to be removed and provides the maximum amount of cervical tissue for laboratory evaluation to rule out the presence of invasive cancer. After the cervical area is visualized, generally by colposcopy, a small cone-shaped specimen of tissue is taken from around the endocervical canal.''Conization is usually done on an out-patient basis under anesthesia in a hospital or surgical facility. For three weeks after the procedure, the woman needs to avoid ''douching'', and using tampons and refrain from sexual intercourse.''Cure rates close to 100% are achieved with conization as long as the cells along the margins of treatment are normal.''With conization, there are associated risks from anesthesia and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding-in about 10% of cases) as well as possible future adverse effects on ''fertility''. Conization is generally performed only on women who have had severe changes on biopsy, have ''adenocarcinoma'' in situ (a diagnosis of cancer in the inner portion of the cervix), or whose Pap smears suggest they may have some invasion of cancer into the nearby tissue.''Large-loop excision of the transformation zone (''LEEP'') removes the cervical transformation zone (the area where the vaginal-type lining changes to the uterine-type lining) using a thin-wire loop to administer electrocautery. It allows samples to be collected for additional tissue analysis and can be performed in the office under local anesthesia.''Specialized (more frequent) follow-up is necessary after LEEP. This follow-up includes Pap smears, colposcopy, and sometimes other techniques. This is now the most commonly used treatment for Pap smear abnormalities.''A hysterectomy for the treatment of abnormal Pap smears is appropriate only for those women who are finished with childbearing and have severe pre-cancerous abnormalities that have persisted despite other treatments.' "
What is the current status of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing?,"'HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that may be spread from one person to another even when the genital sores are not visible. Many sexually active people are carriers of HPV, very often without even knowing they are carriers. It is estimated that up to 60% of sexually active women harbor this virus on their cervix or in their vaginal area. It is not unusual for a woman to be unaware that she has HPV - only to find out that her Pap smear shows evidence of HPV.''HPV is not curable, although the cellular damage it causes is generally treatable and ''vaccines'' against the most commonly found HPV types are available.''The main use of HPV testing in screening for cervical cancer is for determination of treatment and follow-up recommendations for women with Pap smears interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US).' "
"With Pap smears so available, why are women still dying of cervical cancer?","'It is critically important to recognize that the women who are at highest risk for abnormal Pap smear testing are those who are not getting regular Pap testing. Therefore, it follows that in order to improve overall cervical cancer screening, women who are not getting regular Pap smears should be educated about and offered Pap testing. These under-served women should be the most heavily targeted for Pap screening.''Between 60% and 80% of American women who are newly diagnosed with ''invasive cervical cancer'' have not had a Pap smear in the past five years and may never have had one. Women who have not had Pap smear screening tend to be concentrated in certain population groups including:''Many doctors feel that the emphasis should be on universal access to proper Pap screening as opposed to the comparatively small benefit that would come from utilizing the newer technologies in women already undergoing screening.

Facts you should know about Pap smears,"  A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and essentially painless screening test (procedure) for cancer or precancer of the uterine cervix. Cells collected from a woman's cervix during a pelvic exam are spread on a microscope slide for examination. The cells are evaluated for abnormalities, specifically for pre- cancerous and cancerous changes. A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light vaginal bleeding) immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal. Cervical cancer screening is recommended every 3 years for women aged 21-65. The Pap smear is analyzed according to a uniform standardized system known as the Bethesda System. An abnormal Pap smear may show precancerous changes that can be treated at an early stage, before cancer develops. A recording of the woman's menstruation status and whether and when she had abnormal Pap smears previously is essential to the reader of the current Pap smear. Up to 80% of women diagnosed with invasive cancer of the cervix have not had a Pap smear in the past 5 years. Cancer of the cervix is largely a preventable disease."
What is a Pap smear procedure?,"'A Pap smear (Papanicolau smear; also known as the Pap test) is a screening test for ''cervical cancer'"". The test itself involves collection of a sample of cells from a woman's cervix (the end of the uterus that extends into the vagina) during a routine pelvic exam. The cells are placed on a glass slide and stained with a substance known as Papanicolau stain. The stained cells are then examined under a microscope to look for pre-""'malignant'' (before-cancer) or malignant (cancer) changes.''A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and relatively painless screening test. Its ''specificity'','' ''which means its ability to avoid classifying a normal smear as abnormal (a ""false positive"" result), while very good, is not perfect. The ''sensitivity'' of a Pap smear, which means its ability to detect every single abnormality, while good, also is not perfect, and some ""false negative"" results (in which abnormalities are present but not detected by the test) will occur. Thus, a few women develop ''cervical cancer'' despite having regular Pap screening.''In the vast majority of cases, a Pap test does identify minor cellular abnormalities before they have had a chance to become malignant, and at a point when the condition is most easily treatable. The Pap smear is not intended to detect other forms of cancer such as those of the ovary, vagina, or uterus. Cancer of these organs may be discovered during the course of the gynecologic (pelvic) exam, which usually is done at the same time as the Pap smear.' "
Who should have a Pap smear?,"'Guidelines have been developed for cervical cancer screening that address the frequency with which women should have Pap smears. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) both recommend that all women receive cervical cancer screening every 3 years between the ages of 21 and 65. A Pap smear is the typical screening procedure, but when a Pap smear is combined with a test for ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'', the known cause of cervical ''cancers''), screening every 5 years is acceptable for women aged 30 and above.''Pregnancy'' does not prevent a woman from having a Pap smear, therefore, Pap smears can be safely done during pregnancy.''Pap smear testing is not indicated for women who have had a ''hysterectomy'' (with removal of the cervix) for benign conditions. Women who have had a hysterectomy in which the cervix is not removed, called subtotal hysterectomy, should continue screening following the same guidelines as women who have not had a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the risks of having a Pap smear?,"'There are absolutely no known medical risks associated with Pap smear screening. (However, there are medical risks from not having a Pap smear.) A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light ''vaginal bleeding'') immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal.' "
What kind of doctor performs a Pap test?,"'Pap testing is performed by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) or by primary care physicians including family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, or pediatricians. Pap smears can also be performed by other specially trained health-care professionals including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives.' "
How do medical professionals perform a Pap smear?,"""With the woman positioned on her back, the health-care professional will often first examine the outside of the patient's genital and rectal areas, including the urethra (the opening where urine leaves the body), to assure that they look normal.""'A bimanual (both hands) pelvic exam usually follows the collection of the two samples for the Pap smear. The bimanual examination involves the physician or health-care professional inserting two fingers of one hand inside the vaginal canal while feeling the ovaries and uterus with the other hand on top of the abdomen (belly).' A speculum is then inserted into the vaginal area (the birth canal). (A speculum is an instrument that allows the vagina and the cervix to be viewed and examined.) A small brush or swab is inserted into the opening of the cervix and twirled around to collect a sample of cells. A second sample is also collected on the surface of the cervix as part of the Pap smear The samples are placed in a solution from which cells are isolated and used to produce slides for laboratory evaluation."
How will I find out the results of my Pap smear?,"""The results of the Pap smear are usually available within one to two weeks. At the end of Pap smear testing, each woman should ask how she should expect to be informed about the results of her Pap smear. If a woman has not learned of her results after a month, she should contact her health-care professional's office."" "
What is an abnormal Pap smear?,"'An abnormal Pap smear shows cancer or precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix. It is especially important to identify abnormal cells in the early stages, because treatment can be carried out to remove the abnormal cells. The section below entitled ""How is a Pap smear read and analyzed"" contains the specific terminology used in the report for an abnormal Pap smear. '  "
How do medical professionals analyze a Pap smear?,"'Pap smear analysis and reports are all based on a medical terminology system called The Bethesda System. The system was developed (at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland) to encourage all medical professionals analyzing Pap smears to use the same reporting system. Standardization reduces the possibility that different laboratories might report different results for the same smear.''The Bethesda System was the outcome of a National Cancer Institute workshop that was held in 1988 in an effort to standardize Pap smear reports. In 2001, the guidelines were revised and improved. Acceptance of the Bethesda reporting system in the United States is virtually universal.''The major categories for abnormal Pap smears reported in the Bethesda Systems are as follows (described in further detail in the ""What are the possible recommendations for follow-up after a Pap smear?"" section):''The word ""''squamous''"" describes the thin, flat cells that lie on the surface of the cervix. ""Intraepithelial"" indicates that the surface layer of cells is affected. A ""lesion"" means that abnormal tissue is present.''An abnormal or inadequate Pap smear report may contain the following diagnoses.''There is a particular area inside the opening of the cervix where the cells lining the vagina change to the cells that characterize the inside of the cervix (endocervical cells). This is called the ""transition zone"". The Pap smear sample from the cervical opening attempts to sample these cells. However, this area may be so far up inside the cervix that the Pap smear sampling instrument simply cannot reach that high. Sometimes, the transition zone may be less accessible to the Pap brush or the cervical opening cannot be seen well enough to obtain an adequate sample.'""If severe inflammation is present, its cause(s) are investigated. The physician's goals are to identify the cause of inflammation and to treat and resolve the condition, if possible. Untreated inflammation can have consequences for the woman as well as her sexual partner(s).""'The vaginal irritation may be caused by a lack of estrogen, such as occurs after ''menopause'' when the ovaries stop producing this hormone. This lack of estrogen tends to make the vaginal walls irritated and red. If a woman has this condition and it is related to an estrogen deficiency (called ""atrophic ''vaginitis''"" and usually described on the Pap smear report as ""atrophic changes""), her physician may recommend a trial of topical (locally- applied) vaginal estrogen (cream, vaginal estrogen tablets, vaginal estrogen ring) to heal the inflammation. The Pap smear is then repeated.''Sometimes, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (also called ""ASC-US""), is the Pap report. This is the mildest form of cellular abnormality on the spectrum of cells ranging from normal to cancerous. ASC-US means that the cells appear ''abnormal, but are not malignant''.''""Of undetermined significance"" means that the atypical-appearing cells may be the end result of a number of different types of injuries to the cervix. For example, the human papilloma virus (''HPV'') could be the cause of ASC-US. Most instances of ASC-US (80%-90%) resolve spontaneously (by themselves without specific medical intervention or treatment).''A reading of LSIL is a ''reason for immediate further investigation'' because it is more abnormal than ASC-US. Fifteen to 30% of women who have this abnormality on Pap testing will have a more serious abnormality on biopsy of the cervix. Thus, all women with LSIL are recommended to undergo ''colposcopy'' (an examination of the cervix using a special visualizing scope, often accompanied by a ''cervical biopsy'', see below). Even LSIL spontaneously returns to normal without therapy in many women within several months.''The most severe cellular abnormality that is ''not actually cancer'' is high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). A finding of HSIL unquestionably requires prompt evaluation and treatment.' ASC-US: This abbreviation stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. LSIL: This abbreviation stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade I. HSIL: This abbreviation stands for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade II, CIN grade III, or CIS. ASC-H: This means atypical cells are present and HSIL cannot be excluded."
What information is included on a Pap smear report?,"'The first items on a Pap smear report are for purposes of identification. The report is expected to have the name of the woman, the name of the pathologist and/or the cytotechnologist who read the smear, the source of the specimen (in this case, the cervix), and the date of the ''last menstrual period'' of the woman.''The Pap smear report should also include the following:' A description of the woman's menstrual status (for example, ""menopausal"" (no longer menstruating) or ""regular menstrual periods"") The woman's relevant medical history (example, ""history of genital warts"")  The number of slides (either one or two, depending on the health care 
professional's routine practice)  A description of the specimen adequacy (whether the sample is satisfactory for interpretation) The final diagnosis (for example, ""within normal limits"")  The recommendation for follow-up (for example, ""recommend routine follow-up"" or ""recommend repeat smear"")"
Why is a woman's menstrual status important for the Pap smear?,"""A woman who is menstruating sheds cells from the lining of her uterus called endometrial cells. If these cells are seen on the Pap smear of a menstruating woman, the report may note that these cells are present. This is normal if the Pap test was done around the time of the woman's ""'menstrual period''. The comment that these cells are ""cytologically benign"" means that they do not appear to be malignant (cancerous) cells.''However, if a woman is menopausal (no longer menstruating) she would not be expected to be shedding cells from the uterine lining.

Cervista HPV Test Facts," A subgroup of the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to cause cancers of the uterine cervix and other genital areas, the so-called ""high risk"" HPVs. The Cervista test is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the ""high-risk"" HPVs in cervical samples. The sample for the test is taken in the same way that a Pap smear test is performed. There are two Cervista tests available, Cervista HPV 16/18, which identified the two HPV types most likely to cause cancer, and Cervista HPV HR, which identifies all ""high-risk"" HPV types. Cervista testing is not recommended for routine screening; rather, it is used in combination with physical examination, medical history, and other testing to help make decisions about management and follow-up on a case-by-case basis."
What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?,"'Of the more than 100 types of papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect humans, more than 40 types can infect the anogenital tract (genital tract and anus) of men and women and cause ''genital warts'' (known as condylomata acuminata or venereal ''warts''). A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to ''precancerous'' changes in the uterine cervix and cause ''cervical cancer'' or other genital cancers in women. The HPV types that cause ''cervical cancer'' also have been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men.''The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also infect the anogenital tract. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as ''genital warts'' and mild dysplasia of the cervix (potentially ''precancerous'' changes in the appearance of cervical cells under a microscope) and are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found in the majority of cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Twelve other HPV types have also been identified as causes of cervical and other genital cancers, although these are less common that HPV-16 and -18.''HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increase.'

What is the Cervista HPV test?,"'The Cervista HPV test, manufactured by Hologic, is a test that is used to identify the presence of ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) genetic material, or DNA, in cervical samples, such as samples taken during Pap screening or ''colposcopy''. The Cervista test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March of 2009 and was the first DNA test approved by the FDA for detection of HPV in women.''Two different tests are available, known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR. Cervista HPV 16/18 is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with ''cancer'', HPV 16 and 18, while Cervista HPV HR is used to diagnose all 14 ""high risk"" or ''cancer'""-associated HPV types. The choice for which test to use depends on what information the patient's physician wants to collect."" "
How is the HPV test done?,"'For the Cervista test, a sample is taken from the cervix in the same way that a sample for Pap testing is obtained. It can be performed at the same time as Pap testing or ''colposcopy''. There is no special preparation needed for the test, although women should try to schedule Cervista and other screening tests about two weeks after their ''last menstrual period'' and try to avoid having the test performed during the ''menstrual period''. Results are typically ready in about the same time as normal Pap screening results.' "
Who should be tested for HPV?,"'The Cervista test is not used for routine screening of all women and is not intended to be a stand-alone test. It is not recommended for testing in women under 30 years of age who have normal cytology (Pap) results. Cervista is designed for use in women age 30 and older or women with unclear or borderline Pap screening results, such as ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). It can provide more information about the risk of ''cervical cancer'' for women who may have precancerous changes of the cervix. ''According to the manufacturer, the Cervista test ""should be used in conjunction with clinical information derived from other diagnostic and screening tests, physical examinations, and full medical history in accordance with appropriate patient management procedures.""' "
How are the results of an HPV test interpreted?,"'A positive test result does not mean that a woman will definitely get ''cervical cancer''.'""The results of the test are used to help estimate a woman's risk of developing cervical ""'cancer'' or to estimate the severity or risk of findings that may not be clear from physical examination and Pap screening. As discussed previously, the results of the Cervista HPV test are not interpreted alone but in combination with Pap testing, medical history, and physical examination. The test gives one more piece of information to help the health care practitioner make the best decisions about further monitoring and management for each woman on a case-by-case basis.'  "
Facts you should know about paraphilia," Paraphilias are emotional disorders defined as sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors that are recurrent, intense, occur over a period of at least 6 months, and cause significant distress or interfere with important areas of functioning. Except for masochism, medical professionals almost exclusively diagnose paraphilias in men. There are a number of different types of paraphilic disorders, each of which has a different focus of the sufferer’s sexual arousal. There are biological, psychological, and social risk factors for developing paraphilias. While the desired sexual stimulant for the paraphilia sufferer depends on the specific paraphilia, the characteristics of the illness are often very similar, as described in the most current standard reference for mental health diagnoses, the DSM-5. In order to establish the diagnosis of a paraphilia, mental health professionals usually conduct or refer the person for a medical interview, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests. The professional will assess for any history of mental health symptoms. Treatment of paraphilic sexual disorders usually involves the combination of psychotherapy and medication. Paraphilias are quite chronic, such that a minimum of 2 years of treatment is recommended for even the mildest paraphilia. Prevention for the development of any paraphilic behavior usually involves alleviating the psychosocial risk factors for its development."
What is a paraphilia? What are the different types of paraphilias?,"'The word ''paraphilia'' derives from Greek; ''para'' means around or beside, and ''philia'' means love. The definition of paraphilia is any emotional disorder characterized by sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors that are recurrent, intense, occur over a period of at least 6\xa0months, and cause significant distress or interfere with the sufferer’s work, social function, or other important areas of functioning. This is as opposed to sexual variants, which are sexual behaviors that are not typical but are not a part of any illness.''The number of people who suffer from a paraphilia is difficult to gauge for a number of reasons. Many people with one of these disorders suffer in secret or silence out of shame, and some engage in sexually offensive behaviors and so are invested in not reporting their paraphilia. Therefore, many of the estimates on the prevalence of paraphilic disorders come from the number of people involved with the criminal-justice system due to pedophilia. Most individuals with this sexual deviation are men (3%-5% of the male population), with just 1%-6% of those individuals being women. However, women tend to be under-diagnosed with paraphilias, wrongfully given the benefit of the doubt by those assessing their sexual behaviors.''Except for masochism, which is 20 times more common in women than men, paraphilias are almost exclusively diagnosed in men. Many people who suffer from one paraphilia have more than one. For example, about one-third of pedophiles also have another paraphilia. More than half engage in three or four such kinds of behaviors rather than just one. Most people who develop a paraphilia begin having fantasies about it before they are 13 years old.''According to the most current standard reference for mental disorders, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), preceded by the ''DSM-IV'' and ''DSM-IV-TR'"", there are a number of different types of paraphilias, each of which has a different focus of the sufferer's sexual arousal:""'Urges to engage in coercive or otherwise aggressive sex like ''rape'' are not symptoms of a ''mental illness''. Such sexual offending is therefore not considered a paraphilia.' Voyeurism: watching an unsuspecting/non-consenting individual who is either nude, disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity Exhibitionism: exposing one’s own genitals to an unsuspecting person Frotteurism: touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person Sexual masochism: being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise suffering Sexual sadism: the physical or emotional suffering of another person Pedophilia: sexual activity with a child that is prepubescent (usually 13 years old or younger) Fetishism: sexual fascination with nonliving objects or highly specific body parts (partialism). Examples of specific fetishisms include somnophilia (sexual arousal by a person who is unconscious) and urophilia (deriving sexual pleasure from seeing or thinking about urine or urinating) Transvestism: cross-dressing that is sexually arousing and interferes with functioning Autogynephilia is a subtype of transvestism that refers specifically to men who become aroused by thinking or visualizing himself as a woman. Other specified paraphilia: some paraphilias do not meet full diagnostic criteria for a paraphilic disorder but may have uncontrolled sexual impulses that cause enough distress for the sufferer that they are recognized. Examples of such specific paraphilias include necrophilia (corpses), scatologia (obscene phone calls), coprophilia (feces and defecation), and zoophilia (animals)."
What are causes and risk factors for paraphilia?,"'Biological issues thought to be risk factors for paraphilias include some differences in brain activity during sexual arousal, as well as general brain structure. Mental health professionals have found that male pedophiles have lower IQ scores on psychological testing compared to men who are not pedophiles. Research has also determined that they tend to have a history of earning lower grades in school than their non-pedophilic counterparts, regardless of intellectual abilities and learning styles.'""There are a number of psychological theories about how paraphilias develop. Some view these disorders as a manifestation of arrested psychosexual development, with the paraphilic behaviors defending the person's psyche against ""'anxiety'' (defense mechanisms). Others believe paraphilias are the result of the sufferer associating something with sexual arousal and interests, or by having unusual early life sexual experiences reinforced by having an ''orgasm''. Some view these disorders as another form of ''obsessive-compulsive disorder''.''Psychologically, pedophiles who act on their urges by sexually offending tend to engage in grossly distorted thinking, in that they use their position of power and view offending as an appropriate way to meet their needs, think about children as equal sexual beings to adults, and consider their sexual needs as uncontrollable.''Another theory about paraphilia risk factors is that they are linked to stages of childhood psychological development like temperament, early relationship formation, ''trauma'' repetition, and disrupted development of sexuality, as follows:''Family risk factors for paraphilia development include high conflict between parents or low supervision by parents, a lack of affection from the mother, and generally not feeling treated well by their parents. People with paraphilia tend to have trouble making and keeping friends and other relationships.' Temperament: a tendency to be overly inhibited or uncontrolled with emotions and behaviors Early relationship formation: a lack of stable self-awareness, trouble managing emotions, and in seeking help and comfort from others Trauma repetition: People who are the victim of sexual or other forms of abuse, especially if it occurs during childhood, may identify with the abuser such that they act out what was inflicted on them by victimizing others in some way. They may also act out the trauma by somehow harming themselves. Disrupted development of sexuality: The patterns of what brings one sexual pleasure tend to form by adolescence. People raised in a household that is either excessively sexually permissive or inhibited are at higher risk for developing a paraphilia."
What are paraphilia symptoms and signs?,"'While the desired sexual stimulant for the paraphilia sufferer depends on the specific paraphilia, the characteristics of the illness are often very similar. Specifically, people with a paraphilia tend to experience arousal by the stimulant to the exclusion or near exclusion of more common sources of sexual interest, like an attractive person of similar age. The intensity of the sexual attraction can be overwhelming enough to cause distress. The unusual or forbidden nature of a paraphilia often causes symptoms of guilt and fear of punishment.'""Symptoms of paraphilia can include preoccupation to the point of obsessiveness that may intrude on the person's attempts to think about other things or engage in more conventional sexual activity with an age-appropriate partner. Paraphilia sufferers may experience ""'depression'' or ''anxiety'' that is temporarily relieved by engaging in paraphilic behavior, thus leading to an addictive cycle.' "
How do health professionals diagnose paraphilias?,"'Usually providers of mental health care help make the diagnosis of paraphilias, including licensed mental health therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely conduct or refer the person with paraphilia for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of establishing the diagnosis. To ensure that the paraphilic individual does not suffer from a medical condition that could complicate the assessment or treatment of their mental health condition, medical professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation.''As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of paraphilic symptoms. A mental health professional will conduct a thorough exploration for any history or presence of all mental health symptoms such that paraphilia can be distinguished from other types of mental disorders. People with pedophilia may also suffer from a personality disorder or mood disorder, and about 60% have an additional paraphilia, like exhibitionism, voyeurism, or sadism.''In order to qualify for the diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder, the individual has to experience recurrent, significant sexual arousal by the object of their attraction; act on that attraction in urges, fantasies, or actions; and experience the symptoms for at least 6 months to the point that the individual suffers significant levels of distress or interference with his or her work, social function, or other important aspects of life.' "
What is the treatment for paraphilia?,"'Research on the treatment for paraphilias focuses on pedophilia, due to the terrible impact of this behavior on victims and due to the involvement of pedophilic sex offenders with the justice system. Those studies have shown that treatment only tends to work if the person with pedophilia is motivated and committed to controlling his or her behavior and when treatment combines psychotherapy and medication.''Psychotherapy for pedophilia and other paraphilias tends to use ''cognitive behavioral therapy''. The focus of psychotherapy tends to be helping the person with pedophilia recognize and combat rationalizations about his or her behavior, as well as training the pedophilia sufferer in developing empathy for the victim and in techniques to control their sexual impulses. This therapy tends to take an approach to treating sexual offenders using a relapse prevention model that is similar to treating people with a ''drug addiction''. This approach tries to help the paraphilic person anticipate situations that increase their risk of sexually acting out and finding ways to avoid or more productively respond to those triggers. People with paraphilia may also benefit from social skills training to help them develop age-appropriate, reciprocal relationships.'""Medications that suppress production of the male hormone testosterone reduce the frequency or intensity of sexual desire in pedophiles. It may take 3-10 months for testosterone suppression to reduce sexual desire. Studies of the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating pedophilia and other paraphilias vary in their findings on their effectiveness. However, SSRIs may be a helpful addition to other treatments, because they tend to decrease sexual obsessiveness and urges associated with paraphilias and may help with increasing the paraphile's ability to control his or her impulses. Examples of SSRI medications include ""'fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), and ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix).''There is some preliminary research that stimulant medications like ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') can increase the effectiveness of SSRIs, and naltrexone can decrease some of the sexual obsessiveness associated with paraphilias.' "
What is the prognosis of paraphilia?,"'Paraphilias are quite chronic such that a minimum of 2 years of treatment is recommended for even the mildest paraphilia. While most people with a paraphilia do not sexually offend, and sexual offending is not a mental illness, people who commit sexual offenses sometimes also have a paraphilia.' "
Is it possible to prevent paraphilias?,"'Given that paraphilic behavior tends to be highly stigmatized and some paraphilic behaviors are illegal, tracking how successful treatment often involves rates of criminal recidivism. Therefore, prevention of future paraphilic behavior often focuses on preventing sexual offenders from having access to potential victims. Prevention for the development of any paraphilic behavior usually involves alleviating the psychosocial risk factors for its development.' "
What are the parathyroid glands?,"'The parathyroid glands are four, small, pea-shaped glands that are located in the neck on either side of the trachea (the main ''airway'') and next to the thyroid gland. In most cases there are two glands on each side of the trachea, an inferior and a superior gland. Fewer than four or more than four glands may be present, and sometimes a gland(s) may be in an unusual location. The function of the parathyroid glands is to produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), a hormone that helps regulate calcium within the body.' "
What is a parathyroidectomy?,"'Parathyroidectomy is the removal of one or more of the parathyroid glands, and it is used to treat ''hyperparathyroidism''.'  "
What is hyperparathyroidism?,"'Hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much PTH.  If there is too much PTH, calcium is removed from the bones and goes into the blood, and there is increased absorption of calcium from the intestine into the blood.  This results in increased levels of calcium in the blood and an excess of calcium in the urine. In more serious cases, the ''bone density'' will diminish and ''kidney stones'' can form. Other non-specific symptoms of hyperparathyroidism include ''depression'', muscle ''weakness'', and ''fatigue''. Every effort is made to medically treat or control these conditions prior to surgery. These efforts include avoiding calcium rich foods, proper hydration (intake of fluids), and medications to avoid ''osteoporosis''.' "
What causes hyperparathyroidism?,"'There are two types of hyperparathyroidism, primary and secondary. The most common disorder of the parathyroid glands and one that causes primary hyperparathyroidism, is a small, ''tumor'' called a parathyroid adenoma. A parathyroid adenoma is a benign condition in which one parathyroid gland increases in size and produces PTH in excess. (As opposed to parathyroid adenoma, it should be noted that ''malignant'' tumors of the parathyroid glands, that is, ''cancer'', is very rare.)  In most situations patients are unaware of  the adenoma, and they are found when routine blood test results show an elevated blood calcium and PTH level.  Less commonly, primary hyperparathyroidism may be caused by overactivity of all of the parathyroid glands, referred to as parathyroid hyperplasia.''With secondary hyperparathyroidism, the secretion of PTH is caused by a nonparathyroid disease, usually ''kidney failure''.' "
When is a parathyroidectomy necessary and how is it performed?,"'Parathyroidectomy is necessary when calcium levels are elevated, if there is a complication of hyperparathyroidism (such as kidney stones, ''osteoporosis'', or bone ''fractures''), or if a patient is relatively young. Tests such as a high-resolution ''ultrasound'' or a nuclear medicine scan (called a sestamibi scan) help to direct the approach preoperatively or intra-operatively by identifying the location of the overactive, enlarged gland. During a parathyroidectomy, the surgeon delicately removes one or more of the tiny parathyroid glands. In some situations, both sides of the neck are explored, while in other cases a direct approach is made through a small incision (referred to as a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy). In rare situations, the offending gland cannot be found. (A portion of a gland also may be transplanted to another site in the neck or the arm to preserve parathyroid function.)''Whereas preoperative tests help to identify hyperparathyroidism and to direct the surgical approach, PTH levels obtained during parathyroidectiomy help to guarantee the successful resection of the abnormal gland by demonstrating a return of the PTH levels to normal after the suspected parathyroid adenoma is removed. Using this method, a PTH determination is obtained immediately prior to the resection and compared to a PTH determination done ten minutes after the resection.' "
What are the risks of parathyroidectomy?,"'The anatomy of the parathyroid glands is complicated by two important structures: the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the thyroid gland. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a very important nerve that runs very close to or through the thyroid gland next to the parathyroid glands. This nerve controls movement of the vocal cord on that side of the larynx, and damage to the nerve can weaken or paralyze the vocal cord. Weakness or ''paralysis'' of one vocal cord causes a breathy weak voice, and ''difficulty swallowing'' thin liquids. Weakness or paralysis of both vocal cords causes difficulty ''breathing''. In most situations, a special ''breathing tube'' is used that rests in the larynx (voice box) between the vocal cords and is designed to allow for the continued monitoring of their function. In rare situations, the parathyroid adenoma is found within the thyroid gland, and it is necessary to remove the thyroid gland as well. The main goal of the parathyroidectomy operation is to remove the offending gland(s) while protecting the remaining normal parathyroid glands as well as the recurrent laryngeal nerves and the thyroid gland.''Surgery may be unsuccessful, that is, the hyperparathyroidism may not be cured and there may be complications of the surgery. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, their reaction to the anesthetic and their healing following surgery, there can be no guarantee made as to the results or the lack of complications. Furthermore, the outcome of surgery may depend on preexisting or concurrent medical conditions.' "
What are the possible complications of parathyroidectomy?,"'The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning parathyroidectomy. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred at one time or another in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing community standards of care. Anyone who is contemplating surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery or any alternative to surgery.'   Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve with resultant weakness or paralysis of the vocal cord or cords: This is a rare but serious complication. Unilateral  weakness results in a weak, breathy voice, and there will be problems swallowing. A second surgical procedure can alleviate many of the symptoms of unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis results in a relative normal voice; however, there is difficulty breathing, and the patient may ultimately require a tracheotomy. Every effort is made to protect the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Temporary vocal cord weakness occurs much more frequently than permanent vocal cord weakness, and it usually will resolve after several days or within a few weeks. Rarely, a malignant tumor has already invaded the nerve and has caused vocal cord weakness or paralysis. Bleeding or hematoma: In rare situations, a blood transfusion may be necessary because blood is lost during surgery. Patients can choose to have autologous blood (their own blood) or blood from a friend or relative collected in advance of the surgery in case a transfusion is necessary. The surgeon can make arrangements for patients interested in these options. Damage to the remaining parathyroid glands with resultant problems in maintaining calcium levels in the blood: In most situations, you only need one functioning gland to have normal calcium levels. In the rare event that all glands are removed, blood calcium levels may fall, and patients may need to take calcium supplementation for the rest of their lives. Need for further and more aggressive surgery: In some cases,  surgical exploration fails to identify the abnormal parathyroid gland or multiple abnormal glands may be present. Further and more aggressive surgery may be necessary, such as an extensive surgical exploration of the neck or chest. Need for a limited or total thyroidectomy: In rare situations, the abnormal parathyroid gland is within the thyroid gland itself or an unexpected thyroid carcinoma, a malignant cancer, is identified. In such situations, much or all of the thyroid gland must be removed, and there may be a need for life-long thyroid hormone treatment.  Prolonged pain, impaired healing, need for prolonged hospitalization, permanent numbness of the neck skin, poor cosmetic result, and/or scar formation. Recurrence of the tumor or failure to cure the tumor despite effective therapy."
What else do you need to know before parathyroidectomy?,"""Parathyroidectomy usually takes up to three hours. In most situations, the surgery is performed at a hospital or at an outpatient surgery center. An anesthesiologist provides anesthesia and monitors patients throughout the surgery. The anesthesiologist calls the night before surgery to review each patient's medical history or talks to the patient on the morning of the surgery. If  preoperative laboratory studies are ordered, they are done several days before the surgery to allow enough time for the results to be obtained and sent to the surgeon and anesthesiologist.""'Most patients are told not take ''aspirin'' or any product containing aspirin for 10 days prior to surgery in order to prevent aspirin from increasing bleeding at the time of surgery. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, or ''NSAIDs'', (such as ''Advil'', ''Motrin'', ''Ibuprofen'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Aleve'', etc.) also are stopped several days prior to the surgery for the same reason. It is important to note that many ''over-the-counter products'"" contain aspirin or ibuprofen, so it is important that patients carefully check all medications that they are taking. If there is any question about a medication, patients should call their doctor's office or consult with their pharmacist. ""'Tylenol'' is an acceptable ''pain reliever'' if a ''pain'' reliever is needed prior to surgery. Doctors often give patients their prescriptions for postoperative medications at the preoperative visit so that they may have them filled prior to the surgery. Surgeons may advise purchasing calcium-containing antacids such as ''Tums''-Extra Strength tablets in case the blood calcium drops after surgery and ''calcium supplements'' are needed. The amount and duration of supplementation is determined by the surgeon.''Patients do not eat or drink anything for approximately six hours prior to the time of surgery. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'' (or at least reduce the number of daily cigarettes).  This may improve the healing process and reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding.' "
What about care after parathyroidectomy?,"'After surgery, patients go to the recovery room where nurses monitor them for about one hour. In most situations patients spend one night in the hospital, although some patients undergoing a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy may go home the same day. A friend or family member usually is required to pick patients up from the surgical facility if they are going directly home. It is a good idea for someone to be at home with the patient for the first night.'""Patients' necks may be swollen and bruised after surgery, and in most instances there will be a bandage wrapped around the neck. Bandages usually are removed one or two days following surgery. There may be a small ""'plastic'' drain exiting through the skin. If so, the drainage of fluid from the drain will be monitored in the recovery room or hospital. Sometimes patients may even go home with a drain in place after the ''nursing'' staff teaches them how to manage the drain. ''Sutures'' taped to the neck should not be cut or trimmed.''Starting several hours after surgery and possibly for several days, blood calcium levels usually are monitored. It is not uncommon for there to be a fall in the blood calcium level following surgery. (The remaining parathyroid glands are ""sleepy"" following surgery.)  As a result, patients may need to take supplemental oral calcium for several days or weeks following surgery. Permanent calcium problems are rare. ''If patients experience numbness and tingling of the lips, arms, or ''feet'', and or twitching of the muscles--symptoms of low blood calcium--they should contact their surgeon or endocrinologist immediately.'' In most situations in which these symptoms occur, surgeons will ask patients to take supplemental calcium, such as in Tums-Extra Strength, after surgery. This helps to replenish calcium that is moving back into the bones.''Numbness, slight swelling, tingling, discoloration, bumpiness, hardness, crusting, tightness, and a small amount of redness around the incision are a normal findings after surgery and should improve with time. It is usually alright for patients to wash their face, neck, and hair after the bandages have been removed. Excessive scrubbing of the ''wound'' should be avoided, and a gentle soap and shampoo should be used.''In the hospital and after going home, patients generally lie in bed and rest with their head elevated on 2-3 pillows. By keeping their head elevated above their ''heart'', swelling of the neck due to ''edema'' may be lessened. Patients get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom, however. It is good to avoid straining when having a bowel movement, and,  if ''constipation'' is a problem, a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative'' is a good idea.''It may be better to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated after recovery from the anesthetic. Even though patients may be hungry immediately after surgery, it may be best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, patients may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, the doctor may prescribe medications to settle the stomach. A good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Antibiotics often are prescribed after surgery.  Patients should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic pain medication usually will be prescribed and is to be taken as needed. Patients who take narcotics should not drive. If there is ''nausea'' or vomiting postoperatively, patients may be prescribed medications such as ''promethazine'' (Phenergan). If patients have any questions or feel that they are developing a reaction to any of the medications, it is important that they consult with their doctor. Patients should not take any other medication, prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed it with their doctor.'""Sutures are removed approximately 7 days after surgery. If not already scheduled, patients should call the surgeon's office to arrange for a follow-up visit. Routine follow-up care depends on the nature of any problems that develop. After healing has occurred, patients usually return to their endocrinologist for long-term monitoring of their calcium levels.""'Patients may go back to work or school only when their doctors say they may. Patients probably should rest for the first week following surgery and avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard chewing, strenuous activities, lifting heavy objects, and bending over. ''Alcohol'' and tobacco should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Tanning is discouraged for 6 months after surgery; if patients must be in the sun they should use a number 15 or greater sun block and consider wearing a hat. Make-up may be used anytime after surgery.''After 3 weeks, if there are not problems with bleeding or excessive swelling, it is reasonable to resume ''exercise'' and ''swimming''. To allow for postoperative care, it is probably a good idea not to travel out of town for three weeks after surgery.' "
When should patients contact their doctor?,"'Patients should contact their doctor if they notice:' A sudden increase in the amount of bruising and pain associated with excessive swelling of the neck and difficulty breathing. A fever greater than 101.5 degrees F that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid they drink and acetaminophen (Tylenol). (A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour.) Drainage from the wound. Spasms or severe cramps in the muscles or twitching of the face. If this occurs, patients should call their surgeon immediately and be ready to have their blood calcium level determined."
What is interstitial lung disease?,"'Interstitial lung disease includes a group of diseases that have thickening of the supporting tissues between the air sacs of the ''lungs'' as the common factor. The interstitium is a thin layer of tissue that is normally appears as a fine lace on ''X-rays'' or imaging studies (best visualized as the appearance of a sponge).''Interstitial lung disease results from a variety of causes that lead to the thickening of the supporting tissue around the air sacs rather than the air sacs themselves. Interstitial lung disease usually involves all of the lungs diffusely rather than affecting only one area.''A disease of the interstitium is recognized on imaging studies as a thick lace (sponge), sometimes symmetric, and in other types, scattered and irregular.''Several terms related to interstitial lung disease have been used to describe this condition, including ""interstitial ''pneumonia''."" However, since ""''pneumonia''"" is usually associated with an infection, some doctors choose to use the term ""interstitial pneumonitis"" to refer to inflammation in the interstitial space since many of the causes of this inflammation are not infections. ""Interstitial fibrosis"" is the term used to refer to the scarring of the lungs that can result from prolonged interstitial inflammation. Interstitial lung disease can be acute (coming on suddenly) or chronic (occurring over time).' "
What are signs and symptoms of interstitial lung disease?,"'Symptoms and signs of interstitial lung disease occur because the damage to the interstitium of the lung impairs ''breathing'' function.''The two most common symptoms are ''shortness of breath'' and a dry (not producing sputum) ''cough''. These symptoms tend to come on gradually and progress.''Interstitial lung disease that has been present for a long time may cause signs and symptoms related to the lowering of the oxygen levels in the blood, such as ''clubbing'' of the fingertips and enlargement of the ''heart''.''The symptoms can also reflect the underlying disease process and assist in making a diagnosis. ''Fevers'', ''fatigue'', and ''weight loss'' are non-specific but can suggest an infectious process. It is often difficult to make a diagnosis from symptoms alone since so many lung diseases can present with shortness of breath and ''cough''.'  "
What causes interstitial lung disease?,"'Interstitial lung disease has a broad list of causes. The exact cause of interstitial lung disease is not always known (idiopathic). Some of the known common causes include toxins, environmental factors, chronic diseases, ''cancer'', and infections. Depending on the cause, interstitial lung disease can resolve or may lead to irreversible scarring and damage to the lungs.''Known causes of interstitial lung disease include the following:''Examples of idiopathic (unknown causes) forms of interstitial lung disease include:''The distinction among these idiopathic conditions is based on the exact pattern of lung damage, severity, and location of the disease.' Environmental factors, such as toxins like asbestos, mold, certain metals, silica dust, talc, grain dust, or bird droppings; an interstitial disease caused by some of these irritants is referred to as ""hypersensitivity pneumonitis"" Radiation therapy to the chest Certain medications, including some chemotherapy (cancer-fighting) medications and the heart medication amiodarone (Cordarone) Chronic autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and lupus Infections: One of the more common infectious causes of interstitial inflammation is the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Viruses, bacteria, and fungi can all cause interstitial inflammation. Cancer in some cases spreads throughout the lymph system in the lungs and appears as interstitial disease Congestive heart failure, renal failure both can present with similar findings due to excess fluid in the spongy tissue of the lung Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), sometimes known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) Usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) Sarcoidosis Lymphangiomyomatosis Langerhans cell histiocytosis"
How is interstitial lung disease diagnosed?,"'The typical symptoms and signs of interstitial lung disease, when they occur, should prompt a diagnostic work-up that includes a thorough medical history and physical examination, including blood tests to examine ''electrolyte'' levels and blood cells counts. There is such a wide variety of causes of interstitial lung disease that besides imaging studies, pulmonary function tests, a few blood tests, and often biopsy, other testing should be specific to the findings of a good history and physical.''A history of exposures to environmental toxins may be explored if there is no apparent cause of the symptoms. Often, the precise diagnosis comes from the history if extensive occupational, vocational, travel, and exposure history is obtained. For example, if a patient has signs and symptoms of a progressive ''cough'' and shortness of breath with radiologic findings of diffuse interstitial disease and enjoys raising and caring for pigeons, the likely diagnosis would be ''hypersensitivity pneumonitis'' (so called ""pigeon breeders lung"").''The precise diagnosis of interstitial lung disease may require more specific testing that can include imaging studies or tissue sampling. These rarely give a definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic studies that may be useful are:''In most major centers, this biopsy is performed by minimally invasive techniques referred to as video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). This usually only requires a brief hospital stay, sometimes less than 24 hours.' Imaging studies of the chest and lungs are often performed early in the process, when symptoms are apparent. Both chest X-rays and high resolution CT scans of the chest may be ordered. Depending on the history and exam, other testing may be beneficial. For instance, a patient may have arthritic complaints consistent with Rheumatoid arthritis. X-rays of the effected joints may be helpful. Echocardiogram is a test that can evaluate cardiac function as well as the pressures in the lung. This can be useful both for diagnosis and treatment. Sometimes blood tests can aid in the diagnosis and or treatment of these patients. Tests for collagen vascular disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), arterial blood gases, liver tests, and others may be beneficial. Noninvasive tests that measure lung function are known as pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The most common of these involves forcefully exhaling into a tube, on a device known as a spirometer, to measure lung volume and air flow. These PFTs are usually supplemented with more elaborate testing involving a device known as a body box. This helps measure more accurately the different lung volumes but also can measure gas exchange through the tissue of the lung (diffusing capacity or DLCO). Bronchoscopy is the direct visualization and examination of the airways of the lungs using a viewing tube. Biopsies (tissue samples) or washings of the airways are often obtained during this procedure for examination in the laboratory. Usually this does not get an accurate or definitive diagnosis, though it can be helpful to evaluate the possibility of infections, cancer, and sarcoidosis. Open lung biopsy is generally necessary if history and less invasive tests are non-diagnostic."
What is the treatment for interstitial lung disease?,"'The treatment of interstitial lung disease depends upon the cause. Definitive diagnosis is often essential since the treatment may involve:''Antibiotics may be given if a bacterial infection is responsible for the condition. Management of the underlying disease process is also essential in a person with interstitial lung disease related to these conditions. If the disease is thought to involve hypersensitivity, then the best therapy is an avoidance of this offending substance.''Depending upon the severity of the symptoms, respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen and even ventilator support, may be required. Respiratory therapists may be part of a treatment team with the goal of improving day to day function. ''Smoking cessation'' is an essential part of the treatment for anyone with interstitial lung disease.''Corticosteroids'' are sometimes used in an attempt to control interstitial inflammation. ''Drugs'' that modulate immune function, like ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), mycophenolate (''Cellcept'') may be given along with or following steroid treatment. These medications may help slow the progression of the disease, but they are unable to reverse the scarring in cases of long-standing interstitial lung disease. In severe cases with irreversible damage, lung transplantation may be indicated.''The disease of idiopathic ''pulmonary fibrosis'"" does not respond to any measures. The diagnosis can be made at times by the history, physical, and characteristic chest CT findings. Sometimes lung biopsy can be avoided if the patient's signs and symptoms present in the classic fashion. If this disease is strongly suspected or diagnosed referral to a tertiary center for transplant center is recommended for evaluation and possible therapeutic ""'research trials''.'   antimicrobial agents, immunosuppressing agents, avoidance behavior, chemotherapy, and in some, no therapy is available."
What is the prognosis for interstitial lung disease?,"'As mentioned previously, some forms of interstitial lung disease resolve completely, while others lead to long-term and irreversible scarring and lung damage with accompanying respiratory failure . ''Pulmonary hypertension'' is a form of ''high blood pressure'' that affects the arteries within the lungs. This form of ''hypertension'' can develop in cases of long-standing interstitial lung disease and can lead to enlargement of the heart and right-sided (the side of the heart that pumps blood back to the lungs to receive oxygen) ''heart failure'' (known as cor pulmonale). The prognosis is dependent upon the type and severity of interstitial lung disease as well as the underlying health status of the patient.' "
Can interstitial lung disease be prevented?,"'Interstitial lung disease can be prevented only to the extent that its individual causes may be prevented. For example, avoidance of known environmental toxins can help prevent lung damage from these exposures.' "
Facts you should know about healthy parenting,"'Learn the basic principles of healthy parenting, avoid mealtime battles, and encourage physical ''fitness''.''Raising a happy, healthy child is one of the most challenging jobs a parent can ''have -- and'"" also one of the most rewarding. Yet many of us don't approach parenting with the same focus we would use for a job. We may act on our gut reactions or just use the same parenting techniques our own parents used, whether or not these were effective parenting skills.""""Parenting is one of the most researched areas in the field of social science. No matter what your parenting style or what your parenting questions or concerns may be, from helping your child avoid becoming part of America's child ""'obesity'' epidemic to dealing with behavior problems, experts can help.''In his book, ''The Ten Basic Principles of ''Good Parenting'', Laurence Steinberg, PhD, provides tips and guidelines based on some 75 years of social science research. Follow them and you can avert all sorts of child behavior problems, he says.''Good parenting helps foster empathy, honesty, self-reliance, self-control, kindness, cooperation, and cheerfulness, says Steinberg, a distinguished professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia. It also promotes intellectual curiosity, motivation, and encourages a desire to achieve. Good parenting also helps protect children from developing ''anxiety'', ''depression'', ''eating disorders'', antisocial behavior, and ''alcohol'' and ''drug abuse''.' "
What are the 10 principles of good parenting?,"'1. What you do matters''. Whether it\'s your own health behaviors or the way you treat other people, your children are learning from what you do. ""This is one of the most important principles,"" Steinberg explains. ""What you do makes a difference...Don\'t just react on the spur of the moment. Ask yourself, What do I want to accomplish, and is this likely to produce that result?""''2. You cannot be too loving''. ""It is simply not possible to spoil a child with love,"" Steinberg writes. ""What we often think of as the product of spoiling a child is never the result of showing a child too much love. It is usually the consequence of giving a child things in place of ''love -- things'' like leniency, lowered expectations, or material possessions.""'""3. Be involved in your child's life""'. ""Being an involved parent takes time and is hard work, and it often means rethinking and rearranging your priorities. It frequently means sacrificing what you want to do for what your child needs to do. Be there mentally as well as physically.""'""Being involved does not mean doing a child's ""'homework -- or'' correcting it. ""Homework is a tool for teachers to know whether the child is learning or not,"" Steinberg says. ""If you do the homework, you\'re not letting the teacher know what the child is learning.""''4. Adapt your parenting to fit your child'"". Keep pace with your child's development. Your child is growing up. Consider how age is affecting the child's behavior.""'""The same drive for independence that is making your 3-year-old say \'no\' all the time is what\'s motivating him to be toilet trained,"" writes Steinberg. ""The same intellectual growth spurt that is making your 13-year-old curious and inquisitive in the classroom also is making her argumentative at the dinner table.""''5. Establish and set rules''. ""If you don\'t manage your child\'s behavior when he is young, he will have a hard time learning how to manage himself when he is older and you aren\'t around. Any time of the day or night, you should always be able to answer these three questions: Where is my child? Who is with my child? What is my child doing? The rules your child has learned from you are going to shape the rules he applies to himself.''""But you can\'t micromanage your child,"" Steinberg notes. ""Once they\'re in middle school, you need to let the child do their own homework, make their own choices and not intervene.""'""6. Foster your child's independence""'. ""Setting limits helps your child develop a sense of self-control. Encouraging independence helps her develop a sense of self-direction. To be successful in life, she\'s going to need both.""''It\'s normal for children to push for autonomy, says Steinberg. ""Many parents mistakenly equate their child\'s independence with rebelliousness or disobedience. Children push for independence because it is part of human nature to want to feel in control rather than to feel controlled by someone else.""''7. Be consistent''. ""If your rules vary from day to day in an unpredictable fashion or if you enforce them only intermittently, your child\'s misbehavior is your fault, not his. Your most important disciplinary tool is consistency. Identify your non-negotiables. The more your authority is based on wisdom and not on power, the less your child will challenge it.""''8. Avoid harsh discipline''. Parents should never hit a child, under any circumstances, Steinberg says. ""Children who are spanked, hit, or slapped are more prone to fighting with other children,"" he writes. ""They are more likely to be bullies and more likely to use ''aggression'' to solve disputes with others.""''""There are many other ways to discipline a ''child -- including'"" 'time """"out' -- which""' work better and do not involve aggression.""''9. Explain your rules and decisions''. ""Good parents have expectations they want their child to live up to,"" he writes. ""Generally, parents overexplain to young children and underexplain to adolescents. What is obvious to you may not be evident to a 12-year-old. He doesn\'t have the priorities, judgment, or experience that you have.""''10. Treat your child with respect''. ""The best way to get respectful treatment from your child is to treat him respectfully,"" Steinberg writes. ""You should give your child the same courtesies you would give to anyone else. Speak to him politely. Respect his opinion. Pay attention when he is speaking to you. Treat him kindly. Try to please him when you can. Children treat others the way their parents treat them. Your relationship with your child is the foundation for her relationships with others.""''For example, if your child is a picky eater: ""I personally don\'t think parents should make a big deal about eating,"" Steinberg says. ""Children develop food preferences. They often go through them in stages. You don\'t want to turn mealtimes into unpleasant occasions. Just don\'t make the mistake of substituting unhealthy foods. If you don\'t keep junk food in the house, they won\'t eat it.""' "
How can parents avoid the dinnertime battle with their children?,"'Still, there are some gentle ways parents can nudge their kids toward more healthful eating habits. Here are a few thoughts from nationally known ''nutrition'' experts on how to get kids to go from being picky eaters to people with sound, varied diets:'  Avoid a mealtime power struggle. One of the surest ways to win the battle but lose the war is to engage in a power struggle with your child over food, says Jody Johnston Pawel, LSW, CFLE, author of The Parent's Toolshop. With power struggles, you're saying, ""Do it because I'm the parent"" and that's a rationale that won't work for long, she says. But if your child understands the 
why behind the rules, those values can lay the groundwork for a lifetime of sound food choices. Let kids participate. Get a stepstool and ask your kids to lend a hand with easy tasks in the kitchen, says Sal Severe, PhD, author of How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too. ""If they participate in helping to make the meal, they are more likely to want to try it,"" he says. Older children and teens can begin to prepare special meals or dishes by themselves. Get teens started learning to prepare healthy foods before it's time to live on their own.  Don't label. Severe reminds parents that, more often than not, kids under 5 are going to be selective eaters. ""Being selective is actually normal,"" says Elizabeth Ward, MS, RD. She prefers the term ""limited eater"" to the more negative 
term ""picky.""  Build on the positives. ""When I sit down with parents, we'll often find that their child actually does eat two or three things from each food group,"" says Ward. Just as children can get comfort from reading the same story over and over, they enjoy having a set of ""predictable"" foods. ""Even though they aren't getting a wide variety of foods, they are actually doing OK nutritionally,"" says Ward. When the child goes through a growth spurt and has a bigger appetite, use that opportunity to introduce new foods, she 
recommends.  Expose, expose, expose. Ward says a child needs to be exposed to a new food 10 to 15 times before he or she will accept it. But many parents give up long before that. So, even if your child only plays with the strawberry on her plate, don't give up. One day, she just may surprise you by taking a bite. But don't go overboard, says Severe. Limit exposure to one or two new foods a week.  Don't bribe. Avoid using sweets as a bribe to get kids to eat something else, says Pawel. That can send the message that doing the right thing should involve an external reward as well as reinforces the pattern that eating unhealthy foods is a good way to reward yourself . The real reward of sound nutrition is a healthy body, not a chocolate cupcake. Beware of oversnacking. Sometimes the problem isn't that the child doesn't like new foods but that they are already full, says Ward. ""Kids can consume a lot of their calories as milk and juice."" Encourage the kids to drink water rather than juice when they're thirsty. You can also create flavored waters by adding a splash of their favorite juice to sparkling or still water. The same goes for snacks that provide little more than calories, such as chips, sweets, and sodas. ""If you are going to offer snacks, make sure they are supplementing meals, not sabotaging them,"" she says.  Establish limits. Having a set of bottom-line limits can help a parent provide some consistency, says Pawel. For example, parents may require that kids eat nutritious foods before snack food. Or that they must at least try a new food before rejecting it. ""Consistency only works if what you are doing in the first place is reasonable,"" she says. So, avoid overly controlling or overly permissive 
eating rules. If bottom-line limits are healthy, effective, and balanced, they'll pay off.  Examine your role model. Make sure you aren't asking kids to ""do as I say, not as I do,"" says Pawel. If your own diet is based mainly on fat, sugar, and salt, you can hardly expect your child to embrace a dinner salad over 
French fries.  Defuse mealtimes. Don't make your child's eating habits part of the mealtime discussion, says Ward. Otherwise every meal becomes a stressful event, centered on what the child does and does not eat. Ward suggests 
that parents reserve talks about the importance of good eating for later, perhaps at bedtime or story time. Give it time. ""I find that children become much more open to trying new foods after the age of 5,"" says Ward. ""Most of the time, kids will simply grow out of limited eating."""
How can parents fit in family fitness?,"""Children need at least an hour of moderate to strenuous physical activity every day to stay healthy, according to experts. But many kids just aren't getting that much ""'exercise''. And most groups are unanimous on the prime culprit: sedentary entertainment, meaning the temptations of the TV, computer, and video games.'' So, your first step toward encouraging a healthy level of physical ''exercise'"" should be to limit your children's TV and screen time. Beyond that, here are some tips from the experts on how to help your children (and yourself) stay active:""  Make an exercise schedule. Exercise doesn't have to involve a rigid routine. But it's a good idea to schedule a regular time for exercise each day. You and your kids will be more likely to get up and get moving if you've set aside a specific time for physical activity. Many parents find that participation in after-school sports brings some needed relaxation and socialization time as well as fulfills the physical fitness requirement. Support physical-education programs in the schools, which may be reduced or receive less emphasis in some school systems. Communicate to your child's teachers and administrators your belief that physical education (PE) is an important part of the curriculum. Plan your vacations, weekends, and days off around fitness fun. Plan a bike ride, take an invigorating hike along nature trails, or pack a picnic lunch and head for the park for a family game of Frisbee. Make use of community resources. When it comes to finding fitness opportunities, take advantage of what your community has to offer. Join the local YMCA or sign up for tennis 
or other lessons through your Parks and Recreation Department. Look for water aerobics classes and golf lessons at local swimming pools and golf courses. Get the whole neighborhood involved. Organize neighborhood fitness activities for children and their parents. Softball games, soccer matches, and jump-rope contests are fun for kids and adults. Dance! Children of all ages love to dance. Crank up the music, show your kids the dances that were popular when you were a teen, and let them teach you their favorite dance moves. Expose your child to a variety of physical fitness activities and sports. Your child will likely find the combination of activities or sports that are most enjoyable for him or her and will not become bored of one activity. Let your kids take turns being the fitness director for your family. They'll have more fun when they're allowed to choose the activity, and they'll enjoy putting their parents and siblings through their paces."
What are the signs and symptoms of childhood ADHD?,"'The medical community recognizes three basic expressions of the disorder:''The combined type of ADHD is the most common. The predominantly inattentive type is being recognized more and more, especially in girls and in adults. The predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, without significant attention problems, is rare and is commonly seen in boys during early grammar school.''In the United States, ADHD affects about 3%-10% of children. Similar rates have been reported in other developed countries such as Germany, New Zealand, and Canada.''Since 1994, the establishment of the diagnosis of ''childhood ADHD'' has relied upon specific criteria outlined in the ''DSM-IV''. The newly published ''DSM-V'' has reaffirmed criteria for establishing a diagnosis of ADHD. The guidelines emphasize that symptoms must be present for at least six months and generally were noted to be causing disruption of age-appropriate activity before 7 years of age. According to the criteria, such disruption should occur in at least two settings (such as home and school). In addition, these symptoms must not be better explained by another mental disorder (such as ''anxiety disorder'').' Primarily inattentive: The child exhibits recurrent inattentiveness and an inability to maintain focus on tasks or activities. In the classroom, this may be the child who is ""spacing out"" and ""can't stay on track."" Primarily hyperactive-impulsive: Impulsive behaviors and inappropriate movement (fidgeting, inability to keep still) or restlessness are the primary problems. Unlike the inattentive ADHD-type child, this individual is more often the ""class clown"" or ""class devil"" -- either manifestation leads to recurrent disruptive problems. Combined: This is a combination of the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive forms. Usually, the abnormal behaviors are established by the time the child is about 7 years old. ADHD is rarely newly diagnosed in teenagers or young adults. Children with ADHD are often noted to be emotionally delayed, with some individuals having a delay in maturity of up to 30% when compared with their peers. Thus a 10-year-old student may behave like a 7-year-old, whereas a 20-year-old young adult may respond more like a 14-year-old teenager. Boys are more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ADHD. At one time, the ratio of boys to girls with ADHD was thought to be as high as 4:1 or 3:1. This ratio has been decreasing, however, as more is known about ADHD. Greater recognition of the inattentive form of ADHD has increased the number of girls diagnosed with the disorder. Hyperactive symptoms may decrease with age, usually diminishing at puberty, perhaps due to gaining greater self-control as they mature. Inattention symptoms are less likely to fade with maturity and tend to remain constant into adulthood. People with ADHD are also more likely than the general population to have a family member with ADHD."
What should parents do if they suspect their child has ADHD?,"'A school-age child may need evaluation for ADHD if he or she exhibits any of the following behaviors:'""The evaluation of a child suspected of having ADHD involves many disciplines, including comprehensive medical, developmental, educational, and psychosocial evaluations. Interviewing parents and the patient and contacting the patient's teacher(s) is crucial. Investigation regarding the family history for behavioral and/or social problems is helpful. While direct person-to-person contact is considered vital at the outset of an investigation, follow-up studies may be guided by comparing standardized questionnaires (from parents and teachers) completed prior to intervention and subsequent to medication, behavioral therapy, or other treatment approaches. While there is no unique finding on the physical exam in patients with ADHD, unusual physical features should prompt consideration of consultation with a geneticist due to the high association with ADHD behavioral patterns and certain well-recognized genetic syndromes (for example, ""'fetal alcohol syndrome'').''At this time, no lab test, X-ray, imaging study, or procedure is known to suggest or confirm the diagnosis of ADHD. Specific tests may be ordered if indicated by specific symptoms.''Physicians and parents should be aware that schools are federally mandated to perform an appropriate evaluation if a child is suspected of having a disability that impairs academic functioning. This policy was recently strengthened by regulations implementing the 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Act (IDEA), which guarantees appropriate services and a public education to children with disabilities from ages 3 to 21. If the assessment performed by the school is inadequate or inappropriate, parents may request that an independent evaluation be conducted at the school\'s expense. Furthermore, some children with ADHD qualify for special-education services within the public schools under the category of ""Other Health Impaired."" In these cases, the special-education teacher, school psychologist, school administrators, classroom teachers, along with parents, assess the child\'s strengths and weaknesses and design an Individualized Education Program (IEP). These special-education services for children with ADHD are available though IDEA.''Despite this ""federal mandate,"" the reality is that many school districts, because of underfunding or understaffing, are unable to perform ""an appropriate evaluation"" for all children suspected of having ADHD. School districts have the latitude to define the degree of ""impairment of academic functioning"" necessary to approve ""appropriate evaluation."" This usually means the children who are failing or near-failing in their academic performance. A very large segment of the ADHD-affected children will be ""getting by"" (not failing) academically (at least in their early years of school), but they are usually achieving well below their potential and getting more and more behind each year on the academic prerequisite skills necessary for later school success. Unfortunately, some families will have to assume the financial burden of an independent educational evaluation. These evaluations are commonly done by an educational psychologist and may involve approximately eight to 10 hours of testing and observation spread out over several sessions. A primary goal of an educational evaluation is to exclude/include the possibility of learning disorders (including ''dyslexia'', language disorders, etc.).' Has a shorter attention span than peers and needs frequent teacher intervention to keep on task (Parents will often report the need for constant surveillance during homework.) Avoids work that requires sustained attention Daydreams excessively, derailing the completion of tasks Is hyperactive or fidgety Disrupts classroom by leaving seat, moving around room, talking inappropriately, and/or engaging others in play Provokes daily arguments at home about completing homework and chores"
What are the causes of childhood ADHD?,"'The cause of ADHD has not been defined. One theory springs from observations regarding variations in functional brain-imaging studies of those with and without symptoms. However, these variations have been shown in studies of the structure of the brain of ADHD affected and unaffected individuals. Animal studies have demonstrated differences in the chemistry of brain transmitters involved with judgment, impulse control, alertness, planning, and mental flexibility. A genetic predisposition has been demonstrated in (identical) twin and sibling studies. If one identical twin is diagnosed with ADHD, there is a 92% probability of the same diagnosis in the twin sibling. When comparing nonidentical twin sibling subjects, the probability falls to 33%. The overall population incidence is 3%-10%.''Genes that control the relative levels of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters seem to be different in ADHD, and levels of these neurotransmitters are out of normal balance.''While most ''teens'' and adults with ADHD are no longer hyperactive in behavior, they commonly have a suboptimal executive function skill set. The six major tasks of executive function that are most commonly distorted with ADHD are the following:' MRI and other imaging studies suggest that these imbalances occur in parts of the brain that control certain types of movement and executive function (see below). These areas of the brain may be smaller and/or less active in people with ADHD. Shifting from one mindset or strategy to another (that is, flexibility) Organization (for example, anticipating both needs and problems) Planning (for example, goal setting) Working memory (that is, receiving, storing, then retrieving information within short-term memory) Separating emotions from reason Regulating speech and movements appropriately"
What should parents of children with ADHD expect from their child?,"'Children experiencing ADHD should be held to the same expectations as their peers of the same emotional developmental level. Assuming the child has no learning disturbance, children with ADHD will have both academic strengths and weaknesses like all non-ADHD classmates. Athletic ability will vary in a similar manner as will social interaction; some children with ADHD are very outgoing while others are more reserved. Children with ADHD are often noted to be emotionally delayed, with some individuals having a delay in maturity of up to 30% when compared with their peers. Thus, a 10-year-old student may behave like a 7-year-old; a 20-year-old young adult may respond more like a 14-year-old teenager.' "
What type of medical specialist can help diagnose and treat a child with ADHD?,"""The initial evaluation of a child whose behavioral issues may be indicative of ADHD can generally by managed by the pediatrician. A current physical examination is indicated to rule out potential medical issues that may either reinforce a potential ADHD diagnosis or rule out the condition. Further history regarding the various behavioral and academic strengths and weaknesses of the child are elicited and it is imperative to gather feedback from both the parents and teacher. If any concerns are developed regarding potential learning disorders (for examples, dyslexia, auditory processing disorders, etc.), specialized testing should be obtained. This evaluation may be secured either through the child's school district or private agencies. Standardized questionnaires (such as Connors Rating Scales) are often used to provide objective evaluations in both the home and school settings. In addition, these scales commonly have sections to evaluate for other mental health issues (including ""'depression'', ''anxiety'', etc.) that may also be present in a child with ADHD. Once a diagnosis is established, a pediatrician can discuss with the patient and the parents the various treatment options. Children whose physical or mental health history is more complicated may warrant an evaluation by either a pediatrician with specialty training in developmental disorders, a pediatric neurologist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist. Should a patient have a poor response or excessive side effects to commonly used medications, a pediatric neurologist or psychiatrist consultation may be especially helpful.' "
What treatment options exist for a child with ADHD? How can parents help their child with ADHD?,"'The two major components of treatment for children with ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (ADHD) are behavioral therapy and medication.''The medications used to treat ADHD are psychoactive. This means they affect the chemistry and the function of the brain.''Psychostimulants are by far the most widely used medications in treating ADHD. When used appropriately, approximately 80% of individuals with ADHD have a very good to excellent response in reduction of symptoms. These medications stimulate and increase activity of areas of the brain with neurotransmitter imbalances.''The exact mechanism of how these ''drugs'' relieve symptoms in ADHD is unknown, but these medicines are linked to increases in brain levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. Low levels of these neurotransmitters are linked to ADHD.''The psychostimulants most often used in ADHD include the following:''Atomoxetine'' (''Strattera'') is a newer nonstimulant used to treat ADHD. Less is known about its long-term side effects. This drug has several benefits over stimulants, but its use may also carry several negative aspects.''Some medications originally developed to treat ''depression'' (''antidepressants'') also have important roles in treating some individuals with ADHD. Since these medicines have been used for many years to treat other mental health conditions, their adverse effects are well understood.''Other medicines that were originally developed to treat ''high blood pressure'' (alpha agonists) may also be useful in the treatment of those having ADHD. Again, due to widespread and long-term use, their side effects are well known to doctors.'  Home and school interventions: Parents can help their child's behavior with specific goals such as (1) maintaining a daily schedule, (2) keeping distractions to a minimum, (3) setting reasonable goals, (4) rewarding positive behavior, (5) using charts and checklists to keep a child ""on task,"" and (6) finding activities in which the child will succeed (sports, hobbies). Children with ADHD may require adjustments in the structure of their educational experience, including tutorial assistance and the use of a resource room. Many children function well throughout the entire school day with their peers. However, some patients with ADHD will benefit from a ""pull-out session"" to complete tasks, review specific homework assignments, and develop ""management"" skills necessary for higher education. Extended time for class work/tests may be necessary as well as assignments written on the board and preferential seating near the teacher. An IEP (Individualized Educational Program) should be developed and reviewed periodically with the parents. ADHD is considered a disability falling under U.S. Public Law 101-476 (Individuals With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA). As such, individuals with ADHD may qualify for ""appropriate accommodations within the regular classroom"" within the public-school system. In addition, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) indicates that secular private schools may be required to provide similar ""appropriate accommodations"" in their institutions. Psychotherapy: ADHD coaching, a support group, or both can help teens feel more normal and provide well-focused peer feedback and coping skills. Counselors such as psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, behavioral/developmental pediatricians, clinical social workers, and advanced practice nurses can be invaluable to both the children and families. Behavior modification and family therapy are usually necessary for the best possible outcome. The most common adverse effects are short term. They include reduction of appetite, sleep disturbances, rebound (for example, agitation, anger, lethargy as the last dose starts to wear off), and mild anxiety. Most individuals who take psychostimulants for ADHD build up tolerance to adverse effects within a few weeks. Individuals with certain coexistent psychiatric disorders (for example, psychosis, bipolar disorder, some disorders of anxiety or depression) are particularly vulnerable to adverse effects if they do not receive appropriate concurrent treatment for the coexistent condition. Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Daytrana patch, Quillivant XR) Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin, Focalin XR) Dextroamphetamine and amphetamine mixture (Adderall, Adderall XR, Vyvanse) It is not a controlled substance and is not considered a drug of potential abuse by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since it is not a controlled substance, pharmacies may accept phone-requested medical refills. It is usually taken only once a day for full 24-hour effectiveness. It is much less likely than stimulants to disrupt eating or sleeping. For some children, atomoxetine is not enough to control their ADHD symptoms. Many other children do very well on this medicine alone. Specialists treating individuals with ADHD have found Strattera seems to best help improve the problems associated with a disruption in executive function skills. Inattention and hyperactivity symptoms are less responsive. When starting atomoxetine therapy, a gradually increasing dosage schedule is recommended. It may take up to three weeks before full therapeutic benefit is achieved. For this reason, patients may need to remain on previously prescribed stimulant medication during the ""build up"" phase. In addition, atomoxetine must be taken daily; short-term ""medication holidays"" (for example, school vacations and weekends) will limit its efficacy. Studies have indicated a higher than expected incidence of suicide ideation during early treatment. This occurred in patients with pure ADHD as well as in those patients with ADHD accompanied by other emotional disorders (for example, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder). Imipramine (Tofranil): an antidepressant that increases levels of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and/or serotonin in the brain Bupropion (Wellbutrin): an antidepressant that increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, especially dopamine Desipramine (Norpramin): an antidepressant that increases levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the brain Clonidine (Catapres): an alpha agonist that stimulates certain receptors in the brain stem. The overall effect is to ""turn down the volume"" of hyperactive movement and speech. Guanfacine (Tenex, Intuniv): another alpha agonist with an effect similar to that of clonidine. These medications are designed to be used in combination with other medications listed above. They are not effective when taken as a single and only medication."
What are the risks of the use of stimulant medication and other treatments?,"'Stimulant medications have been successfully used to treat patients with ADHD for more than 50 years. This class of medication, when used under proper medical supervision, has an excellent safety record in patients with ADHD. In general, the side effects of the stimulant class of medications are mild, often transient over time, and reversible with adjustment in dosage amount or interval of administration. The incidence of side effects is highest when administered to preschool-aged children. Common side effects include appetite suppression, ''sleep'' disturbances, and ''weight loss''. Less common side effects include an increase in heart rate/''blood pressure'', ''headache'', and emotional changes (social withdrawal, nervousness, and moodiness). Patients treated with the ''methylphenidate patch'' (Daytrana) may develop a skin sensitization at the site of application. Approximately 15%-30% of children treated with stimulant medications develop minor motor tics (involuntary rapid twitching of facial and/or neck and shoulder muscles). These are almost always short lived and resolve without stopping the use of medication.''A recent investigation studied the possibility of stimulant medication used to treat ADHD and ''cardiovascular'' side effects. Concern focused on a possible association with ''heart attack'', heart rate and rhythm disturbances, and ''stroke''. At this time, there is no certainty in a proposed relationship to these events (including sudden death) when medication is used in a pediatric population screened for prior cardiovascular symptoms or structural pathology of the heart. A positive family history for certain conditions (for example, unusual heart rhythm patterns) may be considered a risk factor. The current position of the American Academy of Pediatrics is that a screening ''EKG'' is not indicated before the initiation of stimulant medication in a patient without risk factors.''""Diversion"" is the transfer of medication from the patient for whom it was prescribed to another individual. Several large studies have indicated that 5%-9% of grade- and high-school students and 5%-35% of college-aged individuals reported use of nonprescribed stimulant medication, and 16%-29% of students for whom stimulant medications were prescribed reported being approached to give, trade, or sell their medication. Misuse was more frequently seen in whites, members of fraternities and sororities, and students with a lower GPA. Diversion was more likely with the short-acting preparations. The most common reasons cited for use of non-prescribed stimulants were ""helped with studying,"" improved alertness, drug experimentation, and ""getting high.""''ADHD is a controversial diagnosis for several reasons. Many well-meaning individuals have spoken out against making children behave according to a norm or taking medications for the sake of improving grades. These individuals have expressed concern about ''addiction'' or drugging children. This kind of concern is valid. However, the following must also be considered:''The use of psychostimulants in children should be scrutinized carefully. Fortunately, methylphenidate (Ritalin [and its long-lasting formulation, Concerta]) has been available since 1955. This long period of clinical experience has shown that this is one of the safest medications used in children.' The negative consequences of not using medication for children with ADHD have to be weighed against the known risks. Long-term outcome studies have now been conducted with large numbers of adults diagnosed with ADHD as children, and one clear finding is that those who received medication for their disorder in childhood are more functional and have a better quality of life as adults than those who had the symptoms of the disease but did not receive medicine. Stimulants used for ADHD do not cause addiction. Although tolerance usually develops for the stimulant-associated effects of anorexia, insomnia, or mild euphoria, tolerance does not develop to the increased levels of neurotransmitters. These medications should not be used just to improve grades or quiet down classrooms. School performance should be looked at as a sign of how well the child is doing, just like other areas of health. These medications often improve school performance dramatically, which is linked to better social skills and heightened self-esteem. Studies that have examined whether taking a psychostimulant for ADHD in childhood contributes to future substance abuse have shown this to not be the case. In one very large study, in fact, children who received stimulant medication for ADHD had half the risk of future substance abuse of similar children with ADHD who did not receive medication."
What are other therapeutic approaches for children with ADHD?,"'No specific food or ''diet'' has been clearly shown to have a significant positive or negative effect on the symptoms or course of ADHD. People with ADHD should eat a healthy ''diet'' and probably avoid ''caffeine'', a stimulant. That having been said, some parents note that a dietary change (such as decreased refined ''sugar'"" intake) is beneficial. If an individual is not deprived of necessary nutrients, there is certainly no harm in trying to follow such a dietary adjustment. A good rule of thumb is to discuss the proposed plan with the child's pediatrician.""'Regular physical activity has been shown to play an important role in some of the common related conditions (for example, depression, anxiety) and to improve ''concentration''. Regular ''exercise'' may be beneficial in people with ADHD. Several studies on children with ADHD not taking medication have shown an improvement in concentration and reduction in inattentive and hyperactive behaviors if one hour of vigorous after-school play occurs before starting homework.''CAM'' (''complementary and alternative medicine'') therapies are considered and/or tried in over half of patients with ADHD. Many times these modalities are used covertly, and it is important for the treating physician to inquire about CAM to encourage open communication and review the risks versus benefits of such an approach. CAM treatment modalities incorporating vision training, ''special diets'' and megavitamin therapy, herbal and mineral ''supplements'', ''EEG'' biofeedback, and applied kinesiology have all been advocated. The benefits of these approaches, however, have not been confirmed in double-blinded controlled studies. Families should be aware that such programs might require a long-term financial commitment that may not have insurance reimbursement as an option.' "
Is childhood ADHD on the rise?,"'No one knows for sure whether the prevalence of ADHD (total number of patients) has risen, but it is very clear that the number of children newly identified annually (incidence) with the disorder and who obtain treatment has risen over the past decade. Some of this increased identification and increased treatment seeking is due in part to greater media interest, heightened consumer awareness, and the availability of effective treatments. Teachers are better trained to recognize the condition and suggest that the family seek help, especially in the more mild to moderate cases. The established ''DSM-IV'' ADHD criteria are concise and more exact than those diagnostic tools used previously. This may allow establishment of the diagnosis in children with more subtle or milder expression of the symptoms. The diagnosis of ADHD is also less of a social stigma than in the past. This more enlightened perspective reflects the understanding that ADHD is a biochemical disorder and not merely an ""out of control child."" As such, more parents are receptive to medical therapy for the condition rather than resorting to less effective home/school discipline techniques. Interestingly, the increase in prevalence of ADHD is not solely an American phenomenon but has been noted also in other countries. Whether the number of patients with ADHD has truly increased or rather our better recognition and acceptance of ADHD as a diagnosis has ""increased,"" the number of patients remains to be further defined.' "
What is the outlook for a child with ADHD?,"'Literature supports the clinical observation that as many as 50% of children with ADHD will have symptoms persist into adulthood. One caveat needs to be mentioned -- many studies previously conducted focused on a patient population of males who were evaluated or treated by psychiatrists/psychologists or in clinics specially developed for such a patient population. The value of generalizing these results to the entire patient population with ADHD should be done with caution. Fortunately, new studies are being conducted to address this issue.''The following are current areas of concern:' Education: Follow-up studies of children with ADHD growing into adolescence showed impairment of academic success. A few studies into adulthood have demonstrated persistence of these findings. Completion of expected schooling, lower achievement scores, and failure of courses are areas of concern. Employment: The rate of adult employment of those with and without a diagnosis of ADHD did not vary; however, those with ADHD did have occupations with a lower ""job status."" Socialization issues: A significant subset of children with ADHD has accompanying disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder). In studies that followed children with ADHD into adulthood, between 12%-23% have socialization problems, versus 2%-3% of the general population. Substance abuse: Studies examining whether those with ADHD have a higher likelihood for such high-risk behaviors are controversial. The largest study to date supports other smaller studies that indicate ADHD patients who consistently take their medication have twice the likelihood of not using illicit drugs or excessive alcohol. Driving: A teen with ADHD is two to four times more likely to have a motor-vehicle accident or have his/her license suspended than a peer without such a diagnosis. Impulsivity and inattention again seem to be limited when at-risk teens consistently take their recommended medication."
What can parents of children with ADHD do to help themselves?,"'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (ADHD), whether it affects an adult or a child brings many challenges. People with ADHD can learn, achieve, succeed, and create a happy life for themselves with effort. But making changes is not always easy. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to.''This is the purpose of support groups. Support groups consist of people in the same situation. They come together to help each other and to help themselves. Support groups provide reassurance, motivation, and inspiration. They help individuals see that their situation is not unique and not hopeless, and that gives them power. They also provide practical tips on coping with ADHD and navigating the medical, educational, and social systems that people will rely on for help for themselves or their child. Being in an ADHD support group is strongly recommended by most mental health professionals.''Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group, contact the following organizations. They also serve as an excellent source of accurate information about ADHD. Ask a health care professional, behavioral therapist, education specialist, or look on the Internet.''Attention Deficit Disorder Association''http://www.add.org''Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder''http://www.chadd.org''Learning Disabilities Association of America''http://www.ldanatl.org' "
Introduction to parenting and birthing classes,"""First-time mothers-to-be often have lots of questions and even some worries: How will I know I'm in ""'labor''? Will it hurt? Will my baby know how to breastfeed? How do I care for a ''newborn''? Classes to prepare you for ''childbirth'', ''breastfeeding'', infant care, and ''parenting'' are great ways to lessen ''anxiety'' and build confidence. In some cities, classes might be offered in different languages. ' "
Birthing Classes,"'Birthing classes often are offered through local hospitals and birthing centers. Some classes follow a specific method, such as ''Lamaze'' or the Bradley method. Others review ''labor'' techniques from a variety of methods. You might want to read about the different methods beforehand to see if one appeals more to you than others. That way, you will know what to sign up for if more than one type of birthing class if offered. Try to sign up for a class several months before your due date. Classes sometimes fill up quickly. Also, make sure the instructor is qualified.''You should discuss with your healthcare professional in advance of delivery about yor preferred birth method and plan.''Most women attend the class with the person who will provide support during ''labor'', such as a spouse, family member, or good friend. This person is sometimes called the ''labor'' coach. During class, the instructor will go over the signs of labor and review the stages of labor. She will talk about positioning for labor and birth, and ways to control ''pain''. She also will give you strategies to work through labor pains and to help you stay relaxed and in control. You will practice many of these strategies in class, so you are ready when the big day arrives. Many classes also provide a tour of the birthing facility.' "
Breastfeeding classes,"'Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes knowledge and practice to be successful. ''Pregnant'"" women who learn about how to breastfeed are more likely to be successful than those who do not. Breastfeeding classes offer pregnant women and their partners the chance to prepare and ask questions before the baby's arrival. Classes may be offered through hospitals, breastfeeding support programs, La Leche League, or local lactation consultants. Ask your doctor for help finding a breastfeeding class in your area."" "
Parenting Classes,"'Many first-time parents have never cared for a newborn. Hospitals, community education centers, and places of worship sometimes offer baby care classes. These classes cover the basics, such as diapering, feeding, and bathing your newborn. The American Red Cross offers such courses as ""Family ''First Aid''"" and ""CPR Online - Pediatric.""''You also will learn these basic skills in the hospital before you are discharged.'""In some communities parenting classes are available. Children don't come with how-to manuals. So some parents appreciate learning about the different stages of child development, as well as practical skills for dealing with common issues, such as discipline or parent-child power struggles. Counselors and social workers often teach this type of class. If you are interested in parenting programs, ask your child's doctor for help finding a class in your area.""'Did you know?'' Some hospitals and birthing centers offer sibling classes for soon-to-be brothers and sisters. These classes often help small children get ready for a new baby using fun games and activities. ' "
What is Parkinson's disease?,"""Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder. Characteristics of Parkinson’s disease are progressive loss of muscle control, which leads to trembling of the limbs and head while at rest, stiffness, slowness, and impaired balance. As symptoms worsen, it may become difficult to walk, talk, and complete simple tasks.""""The progression of Parkinson's disease and the degree of impairment vary from person to person. Many people with Parkinson's disease live long productive lives, whereas others become disabled much more quickly. Complications of Parkinson’s such as falling-related injuries or ""'pneumonia''. However, studies of patent populations with and without Parkinson’s Disease suggest the life expectancy for people with the disease is about the same as the general population.'""Most people who develop Parkinson's disease are 60 years of age or older. Since overall life expectancy is rising, the number of individuals with Parkinson's disease will increase in the future. Adult-onset Parkinson's disease is most common, but early-onset Parkinson's disease (onset between 21-40 years), and juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (onset before age 21) can occur.""'Descriptions of Parkinson\'s disease date back as far as 5000 BC. Around that time, an ancient Indian civilization called the disorder Kampavata and treated it with the seeds of a plant containing therapeutic levels of what is today known as levodopa. Parkinson\'s disease was named after the British doctor James Parkinson, who in 1817 first described the disorder in detail as ""shaking palsy.""' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"""The primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease are all related to voluntary and involuntary motor function and usually start on one side of the body. Symptoms are mild at first and will progress over time. Some people are more affected than others are. Studies have shown that by the time that primary symptoms appear, individuals with Parkinson's disease will have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Characteristic motor symptoms include:""   Tremors: Trembling in fingers, hands, arms, feet, legs, jaw, or head. Usually tremors occur while resting, but not while involved in a task. Tremors may worsen when a person is excited, tired, or stressed. Rigidity: Stiffness of the limbs and trunk, which may increase during movement. Rigidity may produce muscle aches and pain. Loss of fine hand movements can lead to cramped handwriting (micrographia) and may make eating difficult. Bradykinesia: Slowness of voluntary movement. Over time, it may become difficult to initiate movement and to complete movement. Bradykinesia together with stiffness can also affect the facial muscles and result in an expressionless, ""mask-like"" appearance. Postural instability: Impaired or lost reflexes can make it difficult to adjust posture to maintain balance. Postural instability may lead to falls. Parkinsonian gait: Individuals with more progressive Parkinson's disease develop a distinctive shuffling walk with a stooped position and a diminished or absent arm swing. It may become difficult to start walking and to make turns. Individuals may freeze in mid-stride and appear to fall forward while walking."
What are the later secondary signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"""While the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are movement-related, progressive loss of muscle control and continued damage to the brain can lead to secondary symptoms. These secondary symptoms vary in severity, and not everyone with Parkinson's will experience all of them, and may include:"" Anxiety, insecurity, and stress Confusion Memory loss Dementia (more common in the elderly) Constipation Depression Difficulty swallowing and excessive salivation Diminished sense of smell Increased sweating Erectile dysfunction (ED) Skin problems Slowed, quieter speech, and monotone voice Urinary frequency/urgency"
What causes Parkinson's disease?,"""A substance called dopamine acts as a messenger between two brain areas - the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum - to produce smooth, controlled movements. Most of the movement-related symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by a lack of dopamine due to the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. When the amount of dopamine is too low, communication between the substantia nigra and corpus striatum becomes ineffective, and movement becomes impaired; the greater the loss of dopamine, the worse the movement-related symptoms. Other cells in the brain also degenerate to some degree and may contribute to non-movement related symptoms of Parkinson's disease.""""Although it is well known that lack of dopamine causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, it is not clear why the dopamine-producing brain cells deteriorate. Genetic and pathological studies have revealed that various dysfunctional cellular processes, inflammation, and ""'stress'"" can all contribute to cell damage. In addition, abnormal clumps called Lewy bodies, which contain the protein alpha-synuclein, are found in many brain cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The function of these clumps in regards to Parkinson's disease is not understood. In general, scientists suspect that dopamine loss is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors."" "
What are the five stages of Parkinson's disease?,"'Researchers may disagree on the number of stages of Parkinson’s disease (range from 3-5 stages). However, they all agree the disease is a progressive disease with symptoms that usually occur in one stage may overlap or occur in another stage. The stage increase in number value for all stage naming systems reflect the increasing severity of the disease. The five stages used by the Parkinson’s Foundation are:' Stage 1: mild symptoms (tremors and/or movement symptoms like swinging arm while walking) do not interfere with daily activities and occur on one side of the body. Stage 2: Symptoms worsen with walking problems and both sides of the body affected. Stage 3: Main symptoms worsen with loss of balance and slowness of movement. Stage 4: Severity of symptoms require help; usually person cannot live alone. Stage 5: Caregiver needed for all activities; patient may not be able to stand or walk and may be bedridden and may also experience hallucinations and delusions."
Is Parkinson's disease inherited (genetic)?,"""In most people with Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, which means that it arises sporadically with no known cause. However, some of people diagnosed with Parkinson's also have family members with the disease. By studying families with hereditary Parkinson's disease, scientists have identified several genes that are associated with the disorder. Studying these genes helps understand the cause of Parkinson's disease and may lead to new therapies. So far, five genes have been identified that are definitively associated with Parkinson's disease.""""Several other chromosome regions and the genes GBA (glucosidase beta acid), SNCAIP (synuclein alpha interacting protein), and UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1) may also be linked to Parkinson's disease."" SNCA (synuclein, alpha non A4 component of amyloid precursor): SNCA makes the protein alpha-synuclein. In brain cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease, this protein aggregates in clumps called Lewy bodies. Mutations in the SNCA gene are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. PARK2 (Parkinson's disease autosomal recessive, juvenile 2): The PARK2 gene makes the protein parkin. Mutations of the PARK2 gene are mostly found in individuals with juvenile Parkinson's disease. Parkin normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins. PARK7 (Parkinson's disease autosomal recessive, early onset 7): PARK7 mutations are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. The PARK7 gene makes the DJ-1 protein, which may protect cells from oxidative stress. PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1): Mutations of this gene are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. The exact function of the protein made by PINK1 is not known, but it may protect structures within the cell called mitochondria from stress. LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2): LRRK2 makes the protein dardarin. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been linked to late-onset Parkinson's disease."
Who gets Parkinson's disease and at what age?," Age is the largest risk factor for the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Most people who develop Parkinson's disease are older than 60 years of age. Men are affected about 1.5 to 2 times more often than women. A small number of individuals are at increased risk because of a family history of the disorder. Head trauma, illness, or exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides and herbicides may be a risk factor."
What procedures and tests diagnose Parkinson's disease?,"""An early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important in developing good treatment strategies to maintain a high quality of life for as long as possible. However, there is no test to diagnose Parkinson's disease with certainty (except after the individual has passed away). A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease - especially in the early phase - can be challenging due to similarities to related movement disorders and other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms. Individuals may sometimes be misdiagnosed as having another disorder, and sometimes individuals with Parkinson-like symptoms may be inaccurately diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. It is therefore important to re-evaluate individuals in the early phase on a regular basis to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms.""'A ''neurologist'"" who specializes in movement disorders will be able to make the most accurate diagnosis. An initial assessment is made based on medical history, a neurological exam, and the symptoms present. For the medical history, it is important to know whether other family members have Parkinson's disease, what types of medication have been or are being taken, and whether there was exposure to toxins or repeated head trauma previously. A neurological exam may include an evaluation of coordination, walking, and fine motor tasks involving the hands.""""Several guidelines have been published to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. These include the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Tests are used to measure mental capacity, behavior, mood, daily living activities, and motor function. They can be very helpful in the initial diagnosis, to rule out other disorders, as well as in monitoring the progression of the disease to make therapeutic adjustments. Brain scans and other laboratory tests are also sometimes carried out, mostly to detect other disorders resembling Parkinson's disease.""""The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is more likely if:""   At least two of the three major symptoms are present (tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slowness) The onset of symptoms started on one side of the body Symptoms are not due to secondary causes such as medication or strokes in the area controlling movement Symptoms are significantly improved with levodopa"
What is the treatment for Parkinson's disease?,"""There is currently no treatment to cure Parkinson's disease. Several therapies are available to delay the onset of motor symptoms and to ameliorate motor symptoms. All of these therapies are designed to increase the amount of dopamine in the brain either by replacing dopamine, mimicking dopamine, or prolonging the effect of dopamine by inhibiting its breakdown. Studies have shown that early therapy in the non-motor stage can delay the onset of motor symptoms, thereby extending quality of life.""""The most effective therapy for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (""'Sinemet''), which is converted to dopamine in the brain. However, because long-term treatment with levodopa can lead to unpleasant side effects (a shortened response to each dose, painful ''cramps'', and involuntary movements), its use is often delayed until motor impairment is more severe. Levodopa is frequently prescribed together with ''carbidopa'' (Sinemet), which prevents levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain. Co-treatment with carbidopa allows for a lower levodopa dose, thereby reducing side effects.'""In earlier stages of Parkinson's disease, substances that mimic the action of dopamine (dopamine agonists), and substances that reduce the breakdown of dopamine (monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors) can be very efficacious in relieving motor symptoms. Unpleasant side effects of these preparations are quite common, including swelling caused by fluid accumulation in body tissues, drowsiness, ""'constipation'', ''dizziness'', hallucinations, and ''nausea''.''For some individuals with advanced, virtually unmanageable motor symptoms, surgery may be an option. In ''deep brain stimulation'"" (DBS), the surgeon implants electrodes to stimulate areas of the brain involved in movement. In another type of surgery, specific areas in the brain that cause Parkinson's symptoms are destroyed.""'An alternative approach that has been explored is the use of dopamine-producing cells derived from ''stem cells'"". While stem cell therapy has great potential, more research is required before such cells can become of therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.""'In addition to medication and surgery, general lifestyle changes (rest and ''exercise''), physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may be beneficial.'  "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for Parkinson's disease?,"""The severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms and signs vary greatly from person to peson, and it is not possible to predict how quickly the disease will progress. Parkinson's disease itself is not a fatal disease, and the average life expectancy is similar to that of people without the disease. Secondary complications, such as ""'pneumonia'', falling-related injuries, and choking can lead to death. Many treatment options can reduce some of the symptoms and prolong the quality of life.'  "
Can you prevent Parkinson's disease?,"""Scientists currently believe that Parkinson's disease is triggered through a complex combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental factors such as toxins, illness, and trauma. Since the exact causes are not known, Parkinson's disease is at present not preventable."" "
What other conditions have similar symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease?,"""In its early stages, Parkinson's disease can resemble a number of other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms known as Parkinsonism. These conditions include:""""Alzheimer's"""" disease and primary lateral sclerosis can also be mistaken for Parkinson's disease. Other similar conditions include essential tremor, dystonic tremor, vascular Parkinsonism, and drug-induced Parkinsonism."" Multiple system atrophy Progressive supranuclear palsy Corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia Stroke Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) Head trauma"
How can people learn to cope with Parkinson's disease?,"""Although Parkinson's disease progresses slowly, it will eventually affect every aspect of life - from social engagements, work, to basic routines. Accepting the gradual loss of independence can be difficult. Being well informed about the disease can reduce ""'anxiety'"" about what lies ahead. Many support groups offer valuable information for individuals with Parkinson's disease and their families on how to cope with the disorder. Local groups can provide emotional support as well as advice on where to find experienced doctors, therapists, and related information. It is also very important to stay in close contact with health care professionals to monitor the progression of the disease and to adjust therapies to maintain the highest quality of living."" "
Introduction to Clinical Trials for Parkinson's Disease,"'You may have heard about ''clinical trials'' from your doctor, read or heard advertisements in the newspaper or on the radio, or found out about trials in your area through a support group or association. Before you decide to participate in a trial, you should be aware of the potential benefits and risks. This guide provides a brief overview of the clinical trial process.' "
What Is a Clinical Trial?,"'A clinical trial is a research program conducted in patients to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug, or device. The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating diseases and special conditions.''During a clinical trial, doctors use the best available treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. The new treatments are hoped to be at least as effective as -- or possibly more effective than -- the standard.''New treatment options are first researched in the laboratory, where they are carefully studied in the test tube and in animals. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial.'""When a new medical treatment is studied for the first time in humans, scientists don't know exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to these questions:"" Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work?"
How Does the Clinical Trial Process Work?,"'Clinical trials are conducted in phases -- each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous phases.'""Participants may be eligible for clinical trials in different phases, depending on the participants' overall condition. Most clinical trial participants take part in phases III and IV.""'In a phase I clinical trial, a new research treatment is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely.''Phase II clinical trials determine the effectiveness of the research treatment on the disease or condition being evaluated.''Phase III clinical trials compare the new treatment with the standard treatment.''Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. For example, a new drug that was found effective in a clinical trial may then be used together with other effective ''drugs'' to treat the particular disease or special condition in a select group of patients.' "
What Are the Advantages of Participating in a Clinical Trial?,"'The advantages of participating in a clinical trial include the following:' Clinical trials make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances to patient care. You may receive a new treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can help to provide researchers with information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods, for your benefit and to benefit others. Your treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and doctor visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the doctors and nurses conducting the clinical trial."
What Are the Disadvantages of Participating in a Clinical Trial?,"'Because the drug or device being studied is new, all of the risks and side effects of the treatment are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. There may be unknown side effects (as well as hoped-for benefits). Patients will be informed of any known side effects they could experience, as well as any side effects that occur or become known while they are participating in the trial.''It is also important that you realize that if you participate in a clinical trial you may be given a placebo, which is a ''sugar'' pill containing no medicine. These tablets are used to determine if the real treatment is really working effectively. Trials are conducted in such a way that you will not be told if you\'re getting the real treatment or a ""fake"" treatment.' "
How Would My Care Be Different if I Participated in a Clinical Trial?," You may receive more exams and tests than are usually given for your particular condition. The purpose of these tests is to follow your progress and collect study data. Of course, tests can carry certain benefits and risks or discomforts of their own. Although they can be inconvenient, these tests can assure extra observation. Depending on the type of clinical trial, you may be asked to stop or change the medication(s) you are currently taking. You may also be asked to change your diet or any activities that could affect the outcome of the trial. As mentioned above, you could get the placebo rather than the real medicine."
What Is Informed Consent?,"'Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The doctors and nurses conducting the trial will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks.''You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the researchers to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. (See ""Important Questions to Ask"" below.)''You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way.''Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments.''The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial.' "
Who Can Participate in a Clinical Trial?,"'Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm that you are eligible.' "
What Is It Like to Participate in a Clinical Trial?,"'All patients face a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of being experimented upon or being a guinea pig are common concerns of patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial.''Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties.''This may help ease your concerns:' The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time throughout the trial you and your doctor feel it is in your best interest to exit the trial and use other known treatments, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard treatments are given -- in clinics or doctor's offices. Clinical trial participants are watched closely, and information about you will be carefully recorded and reviewed."
Important Questions to Ask,"'If you are thinking about taking part in a clinical trial, find out as much as possible about the study before you decide to participate. Here are some important questions to ask:''For information about other ongoing '""Parkinson's""' disease studies, contact the National Institutes of Health.''WebMD Medical Reference' What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests administered? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? (Are there standard treatment options in my case, and how does the study treatment compare with them?) How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require me to give up some of my personal time? If so, how much? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change doctors? If the treatment works for me, can I continue taking it after the trial?"
Introduction to eating right with Parkinson's disease,"'While there is no special ''diet'' required for people with '""Parkinson's""' disease, eating a well-balanced, nutritious ''diet'"" is extremely beneficial. With the proper diet, our bodies work more efficiently, we have more energy, and Parkinson's disease medications will work properly.""'This article addresses the basics of good ''nutrition''. Please consult your doctor or dietitian before making any dietary changes. A registered dietitian can provide in-depth ''nutrition'' education, tailor these general guidelines to meet your needs, and help you create and follow a personal meal plan.' "
The Basics of Eating Well," Eat a variety of foods from each food category. Ask your doctor if you should take a daily vitamin supplement. Maintain your weight through a proper balance of exercise and food. Ask your doctor what your ""goal"" weight should be and how many calories you should consume per day. Include high-fiber foods such as vegetables, cooked dried peas and beans (legumes), whole-grain foods, bran, cereals, pasta, rice, and fresh fruit in your diet. Choose foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Try to limit sugars. Moderate your use of salt. Drink eight 8 oz. glasses of water per day. Ask your doctor about drinking alcoholic beverages (alcohol may interfere with some of your medications)."
Medication and Food Interactions,"'The medication levodopa generally works best when taken on an empty stomach, about ½ hour before meals or at least one hour after meals. It should be taken with 4-5 oz. of water. This allows the drug to be absorbed in the body more quickly.''For some patients, levodopa may cause ''nausea'' when taken on an empty stomach. Therefore, your doctor may prescribe a combination of levodopa and ''carbidopa'' (called ''Sinemet'') or carbidopa by itself (called ''Lodosyn''). If ''nausea'' is a continual problem, your doctor may be able to prescribe another drug to relieve these symptoms. There are also tips listed below that can help relieve nausea.''Also, ask your doctor if you should change your daily protein intake. In rare cases, a diet high in protein limits the effectiveness of levodopa.' "
Controlling Nausea,"'There are several ways to control or relieve nausea, including:' Drink clear or ice-cold drinks. Drinks containing sugar may calm the stomach better than other liquids. Avoid orange and grapefruit juices because these are too acidic and may worsen nausea. Drink beverages slowly. Drink liquids between meals instead of during them. Eat light, bland foods (such as saltine crackers or plain bread). Avoid fried, greasy, or sweet foods. Eat slowly. Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. Do not mix hot and cold foods. Eat foods that are cold or at room temperature to avoid getting nauseated from the smell of hot or warm foods. Rest after eating, keeping your head elevated. Activity may worsen nausea and may lead to vomiting. Avoid brushing your teeth after eating. If you feel nauseated when you wake up in the morning, eat some crackers before getting out of bed or eat a high protein snack before going to bed (lean meat or cheese). Try to eat when you feel less nauseated. If these techniques do not seem to ease your queasy stomach, consult your doctor."
Relieving Thirst/Dry Mouth,"""Some Parkinson's disease medications may make you thirsty. Here are some tips for relieving ""'thirst'' and ''dry mouth'':' Drink eight or more cups of liquid each day. But, some people with Parkinson's disease who also have heart problems may need to limit their fluids, so be sure to follow your doctor's guidelines. Limit caffeine (contained in coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate) as it may interfere with some of your medications and may actually make you more dehydrated. Dunk or moisten breads, toast, cookies, or crackers in milk, decaffeinated tea or coffee to soften them. Take a drink after each bite of food to moisten your mouth and to help you swallow. Add sauces to foods to make them soft and moist. Try gravy, broth, sauce, or melted butter. Eat sour candy or fruit ice to help increase saliva and moisten your mouth. Don't use a commercial mouthwash. Commercial mouthwashes often contain alcohol that can dry your mouth. Ask your doctor or dentist about alternative mouthwash products. Ask your doctor about artificial saliva products. They are available by prescription."
"I am Too Tired to Eat in the Evening, What Should I Do?","'If you are often too tired to eat later in the day, here are some tips:' Save your energy. Choose foods that are easy to prepare. Don't waste all your energy in preparing the meal because then you'll feel too tired to eat. Ask your family to help with meal preparations. Check to see if you are eligible to participate in your local Meals on Wheels Program. Keep healthy snack foods on hand such as fresh fruit and vegetables, pretzels, crackers, high-fiber cold cereals. Freeze extra portions of what you cook so you have a quick meal when you're too tired. Rest before eating so you can enjoy your meal. Try eating your main meal early in the day so you have enough energy to last you for the day."
"I Don't Feel like Eating, What Should I Do?","'Here are some tips for improving poor appetite.''Here are some tips to help you eat more at meals.''Here are some tips to help you eat snacks.' Talk to your doctor; sometimes, poor appetite is due to depression, which can be treated. Your appetite will probably improve after depression is treated. Avoid non-nutritious beverages. Eat small, frequent meals and snacks. Walk or participate in another light activity to stimulate your appetite. Drink beverages after a meal instead of before or during a meal so that you do not feel full before you begin eating. Plan meals to include your favorite foods. Try eating the high-calorie foods in your meal first. Use your imagination to increase the variety of food you're eating. Don't waste your energy eating foods that provide little or no nutritional value such as potato chips, candy bars, colas, and other snack foods. Choose high-protein and high-calorie snacks. High calorie snacks include: ice cream, cookies, pudding, cheese, granola bars, custard, sandwiches, nachos with cheese, eggs, crackers with peanut butter, bagels with peanut butter or cream cheese, cereal with half and half, fruit or vegetables with dips, yogurt with granola, popcorn with margarine and parmesan cheese, or bread sticks with cheese sauce."
How Can I Make Eating More Enjoyable?," Make food preparation an easy task. Choose foods that are easy to prepare and eat. Make eating a pleasurable experience, not a chore. For example, liven up your meals by using colorful place settings and play background music during meals. Try not to eat alone. Invite a guest to share you meal or go out to dinner. Use colorful garnishes such as parsley and red or yellow peppers to make food look more appealing and appetizing."
Maintaining Your Weight With Parkinson's Disease,"""Malnutrition and weight maintenance is often an issue for people with Parkinson's disease. Here are some tips to help you maintain a healthy weight.""'Here are some tips for gaining weight.' Weigh yourself once or twice a week, unless your doctor recommends weighing yourself  often. If you are taking diuretics or steroids, such as prednisone, you should weigh yourself daily. If you have an unexplained weight gain or loss (2 pounds in one day or 5 pounds in one week), contact your doctor. He or she may want to modify your food or fluid intake to help manage your condition. Ask your doctor about nutritional supplements. Sometimes supplements in the form of snacks, drinks (such as Ensure or Boost), or vitamins may be prescribed to eat between meals to help you increase your calories and get the right amount of nutrients every day. But, be sure to check with your doctor before making any dietary changes or before adding supplements to your diet. Some can be harmful or interfere with your medication. Avoid low-fat or low-calorie products. (unless other dietary guidelines have been recommended). Use whole milk, whole milk cheese, and yogurt."

What is Parkinson's disease?,"""Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most common movement disorder. Characteristics of Parkinson’s disease are progressive loss of muscle control, which leads to trembling of the limbs and head while at rest, stiffness, slowness, and impaired balance. As symptoms worsen, it may become difficult to walk, talk, and complete simple tasks.""""The progression of Parkinson's disease and the degree of impairment vary from person to person. Many people with Parkinson's disease live long productive lives, whereas others become disabled much more quickly. Complications of Parkinson’s such as falling-related injuries or ""'pneumonia''. However, studies of patent populations with and without Parkinson’s Disease suggest the life expectancy for people with the disease is about the same as the general population.'""Most people who develop Parkinson's disease are 60 years of age or older. Since overall life expectancy is rising, the number of individuals with Parkinson's disease will increase in the future. Adult-onset Parkinson's disease is most common, but early-onset Parkinson's disease (onset between 21-40 years), and juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease (onset before age 21) can occur.""'Descriptions of Parkinson\'s disease date back as far as 5000 BC. Around that time, an ancient Indian civilization called the disorder Kampavata and treated it with the seeds of a plant containing therapeutic levels of what is today known as levodopa. Parkinson\'s disease was named after the British doctor James Parkinson, who in 1817 first described the disorder in detail as ""shaking palsy.""' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"""The primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease are all related to voluntary and involuntary motor function and usually start on one side of the body. Symptoms are mild at first and will progress over time. Some people are more affected than others are. Studies have shown that by the time that primary symptoms appear, individuals with Parkinson's disease will have lost 60% to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the brain. Characteristic motor symptoms include:""   Tremors: Trembling in fingers, hands, arms, feet, legs, jaw, or head. Usually tremors occur while resting, but not while involved in a task. Tremors may worsen when a person is excited, tired, or stressed. Rigidity: Stiffness of the limbs and trunk, which may increase during movement. Rigidity may produce muscle aches and pain. Loss of fine hand movements can lead to cramped handwriting (micrographia) and may make eating difficult. Bradykinesia: Slowness of voluntary movement. Over time, it may become difficult to initiate movement and to complete movement. Bradykinesia together with stiffness can also affect the facial muscles and result in an expressionless, ""mask-like"" appearance. Postural instability: Impaired or lost reflexes can make it difficult to adjust posture to maintain balance. Postural instability may lead to falls. Parkinsonian gait: Individuals with more progressive Parkinson's disease develop a distinctive shuffling walk with a stooped position and a diminished or absent arm swing. It may become difficult to start walking and to make turns. Individuals may freeze in mid-stride and appear to fall forward while walking."
What are the later secondary signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"""While the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are movement-related, progressive loss of muscle control and continued damage to the brain can lead to secondary symptoms. These secondary symptoms vary in severity, and not everyone with Parkinson's will experience all of them, and may include:"" Anxiety, insecurity, and stress Confusion Memory loss Dementia (more common in the elderly) Constipation Depression Difficulty swallowing and excessive salivation Diminished sense of smell Increased sweating Erectile dysfunction (ED) Skin problems Slowed, quieter speech, and monotone voice Urinary frequency/urgency"
What causes Parkinson's disease?,"""A substance called dopamine acts as a messenger between two brain areas - the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum - to produce smooth, controlled movements. Most of the movement-related symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by a lack of dopamine due to the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. When the amount of dopamine is too low, communication between the substantia nigra and corpus striatum becomes ineffective, and movement becomes impaired; the greater the loss of dopamine, the worse the movement-related symptoms. Other cells in the brain also degenerate to some degree and may contribute to non-movement related symptoms of Parkinson's disease.""""Although it is well known that lack of dopamine causes the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, it is not clear why the dopamine-producing brain cells deteriorate. Genetic and pathological studies have revealed that various dysfunctional cellular processes, inflammation, and ""'stress'"" can all contribute to cell damage. In addition, abnormal clumps called Lewy bodies, which contain the protein alpha-synuclein, are found in many brain cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The function of these clumps in regards to Parkinson's disease is not understood. In general, scientists suspect that dopamine loss is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors."" "
What are the five stages of Parkinson's disease?,"'Researchers may disagree on the number of stages of Parkinson’s disease (range from 3-5 stages). However, they all agree the disease is a progressive disease with symptoms that usually occur in one stage may overlap or occur in another stage. The stage increase in number value for all stage naming systems reflect the increasing severity of the disease. The five stages used by the Parkinson’s Foundation are:' Stage 1: mild symptoms (tremors and/or movement symptoms like swinging arm while walking) do not interfere with daily activities and occur on one side of the body. Stage 2: Symptoms worsen with walking problems and both sides of the body affected. Stage 3: Main symptoms worsen with loss of balance and slowness of movement. Stage 4: Severity of symptoms require help; usually person cannot live alone. Stage 5: Caregiver needed for all activities; patient may not be able to stand or walk and may be bedridden and may also experience hallucinations and delusions."
Is Parkinson's disease inherited (genetic)?,"""In most people with Parkinson's disease is idiopathic, which means that it arises sporadically with no known cause. However, some of people diagnosed with Parkinson's also have family members with the disease. By studying families with hereditary Parkinson's disease, scientists have identified several genes that are associated with the disorder. Studying these genes helps understand the cause of Parkinson's disease and may lead to new therapies. So far, five genes have been identified that are definitively associated with Parkinson's disease.""""Several other chromosome regions and the genes GBA (glucosidase beta acid), SNCAIP (synuclein alpha interacting protein), and UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1) may also be linked to Parkinson's disease."" SNCA (synuclein, alpha non A4 component of amyloid precursor): SNCA makes the protein alpha-synuclein. In brain cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease, this protein aggregates in clumps called Lewy bodies. Mutations in the SNCA gene are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. PARK2 (Parkinson's disease autosomal recessive, juvenile 2): The PARK2 gene makes the protein parkin. Mutations of the PARK2 gene are mostly found in individuals with juvenile Parkinson's disease. Parkin normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins. PARK7 (Parkinson's disease autosomal recessive, early onset 7): PARK7 mutations are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. The PARK7 gene makes the DJ-1 protein, which may protect cells from oxidative stress. PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1): Mutations of this gene are found in early-onset Parkinson's disease. The exact function of the protein made by PINK1 is not known, but it may protect structures within the cell called mitochondria from stress. LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2): LRRK2 makes the protein dardarin. Mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been linked to late-onset Parkinson's disease."
Who gets Parkinson's disease and at what age?," Age is the largest risk factor for the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Most people who develop Parkinson's disease are older than 60 years of age. Men are affected about 1.5 to 2 times more often than women. A small number of individuals are at increased risk because of a family history of the disorder. Head trauma, illness, or exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides and herbicides may be a risk factor."
What procedures and tests diagnose Parkinson's disease?,"""An early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important in developing good treatment strategies to maintain a high quality of life for as long as possible. However, there is no test to diagnose Parkinson's disease with certainty (except after the individual has passed away). A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease - especially in the early phase - can be challenging due to similarities to related movement disorders and other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms. Individuals may sometimes be misdiagnosed as having another disorder, and sometimes individuals with Parkinson-like symptoms may be inaccurately diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. It is therefore important to re-evaluate individuals in the early phase on a regular basis to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms.""'A ''neurologist'"" who specializes in movement disorders will be able to make the most accurate diagnosis. An initial assessment is made based on medical history, a neurological exam, and the symptoms present. For the medical history, it is important to know whether other family members have Parkinson's disease, what types of medication have been or are being taken, and whether there was exposure to toxins or repeated head trauma previously. A neurological exam may include an evaluation of coordination, walking, and fine motor tasks involving the hands.""""Several guidelines have been published to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. These include the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Tests are used to measure mental capacity, behavior, mood, daily living activities, and motor function. They can be very helpful in the initial diagnosis, to rule out other disorders, as well as in monitoring the progression of the disease to make therapeutic adjustments. Brain scans and other laboratory tests are also sometimes carried out, mostly to detect other disorders resembling Parkinson's disease.""""The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is more likely if:""   At least two of the three major symptoms are present (tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, and slowness) The onset of symptoms started on one side of the body Symptoms are not due to secondary causes such as medication or strokes in the area controlling movement Symptoms are significantly improved with levodopa"
What is the treatment for Parkinson's disease?,"""There is currently no treatment to cure Parkinson's disease. Several therapies are available to delay the onset of motor symptoms and to ameliorate motor symptoms. All of these therapies are designed to increase the amount of dopamine in the brain either by replacing dopamine, mimicking dopamine, or prolonging the effect of dopamine by inhibiting its breakdown. Studies have shown that early therapy in the non-motor stage can delay the onset of motor symptoms, thereby extending quality of life.""""The most effective therapy for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (""'Sinemet''), which is converted to dopamine in the brain. However, because long-term treatment with levodopa can lead to unpleasant side effects (a shortened response to each dose, painful ''cramps'', and involuntary movements), its use is often delayed until motor impairment is more severe. Levodopa is frequently prescribed together with ''carbidopa'' (Sinemet), which prevents levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain. Co-treatment with carbidopa allows for a lower levodopa dose, thereby reducing side effects.'""In earlier stages of Parkinson's disease, substances that mimic the action of dopamine (dopamine agonists), and substances that reduce the breakdown of dopamine (monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors) can be very efficacious in relieving motor symptoms. Unpleasant side effects of these preparations are quite common, including swelling caused by fluid accumulation in body tissues, drowsiness, ""'constipation'', ''dizziness'', hallucinations, and ''nausea''.''For some individuals with advanced, virtually unmanageable motor symptoms, surgery may be an option. In ''deep brain stimulation'"" (DBS), the surgeon implants electrodes to stimulate areas of the brain involved in movement. In another type of surgery, specific areas in the brain that cause Parkinson's symptoms are destroyed.""'An alternative approach that has been explored is the use of dopamine-producing cells derived from ''stem cells'"". While stem cell therapy has great potential, more research is required before such cells can become of therapeutic value in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.""'In addition to medication and surgery, general lifestyle changes (rest and ''exercise''), physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may be beneficial.'  "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for Parkinson's disease?,"""The severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms and signs vary greatly from person to peson, and it is not possible to predict how quickly the disease will progress. Parkinson's disease itself is not a fatal disease, and the average life expectancy is similar to that of people without the disease. Secondary complications, such as ""'pneumonia'', falling-related injuries, and choking can lead to death. Many treatment options can reduce some of the symptoms and prolong the quality of life.'  "
Can you prevent Parkinson's disease?,"""Scientists currently believe that Parkinson's disease is triggered through a complex combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental factors such as toxins, illness, and trauma. Since the exact causes are not known, Parkinson's disease is at present not preventable."" "
What other conditions have similar symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease?,"""In its early stages, Parkinson's disease can resemble a number of other conditions with Parkinson-like symptoms known as Parkinsonism. These conditions include:""""Alzheimer's"""" disease and primary lateral sclerosis can also be mistaken for Parkinson's disease. Other similar conditions include essential tremor, dystonic tremor, vascular Parkinsonism, and drug-induced Parkinsonism."" Multiple system atrophy Progressive supranuclear palsy Corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia Stroke Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) Head trauma"
How can people learn to cope with Parkinson's disease?,"""Although Parkinson's disease progresses slowly, it will eventually affect every aspect of life - from social engagements, work, to basic routines. Accepting the gradual loss of independence can be difficult. Being well informed about the disease can reduce ""'anxiety'"" about what lies ahead. Many support groups offer valuable information for individuals with Parkinson's disease and their families on how to cope with the disorder. Local groups can provide emotional support as well as advice on where to find experienced doctors, therapists, and related information. It is also very important to stay in close contact with health care professionals to monitor the progression of the disease and to adjust therapies to maintain the highest quality of living."" "
Introduction to Clinical Trials for Parkinson's Disease,"'You may have heard about ''clinical trials'' from your doctor, read or heard advertisements in the newspaper or on the radio, or found out about trials in your area through a support group or association. Before you decide to participate in a trial, you should be aware of the potential benefits and risks. This guide provides a brief overview of the clinical trial process.' "
What Is a Clinical Trial?,"'A clinical trial is a research program conducted in patients to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug, or device. The purpose of clinical trials is to find new and improved methods of treating diseases and special conditions.''During a clinical trial, doctors use the best available treatment as a standard to evaluate new treatments. The new treatments are hoped to be at least as effective as -- or possibly more effective than -- the standard.''New treatment options are first researched in the laboratory, where they are carefully studied in the test tube and in animals. Only the treatments most likely to work are further evaluated in a small group of humans prior to applying them in a larger clinical trial.'""When a new medical treatment is studied for the first time in humans, scientists don't know exactly how it will work. With any new treatment, there are possible risks as well as benefits. Clinical trials help doctors discover the answers to these questions:"" Is the treatment safe and effective? Is the treatment potentially better than the treatments currently available? What are the side effects of the treatment? Does the treatment have any possible risks? How well does the treatment work?"
How Does the Clinical Trial Process Work?,"'Clinical trials are conducted in phases -- each designed to find out specific information. Each new phase of a clinical trial builds on information from previous phases.'""Participants may be eligible for clinical trials in different phases, depending on the participants' overall condition. Most clinical trial participants take part in phases III and IV.""'In a phase I clinical trial, a new research treatment is given to a small number of participants. The researchers determine the best way to give the new treatment and how much of it can be given safely.''Phase II clinical trials determine the effectiveness of the research treatment on the disease or condition being evaluated.''Phase III clinical trials compare the new treatment with the standard treatment.''Phase IV clinical trials apply the new treatment to patient care. For example, a new drug that was found effective in a clinical trial may then be used together with other effective ''drugs'' to treat the particular disease or special condition in a select group of patients.' "
What Are the Advantages of Participating in a Clinical Trial?,"'The advantages of participating in a clinical trial include the following:' Clinical trials make it possible to apply the latest scientific and technological advances to patient care. You may receive a new treatment before it is widely available to the public. You can help to provide researchers with information they need to continue developing new procedures and introducing new treatment methods, for your benefit and to benefit others. Your treatment costs may be decreased, since many of the tests and doctor visits that are directly related to the clinical trial are paid for by the company or agency sponsoring the study. Be sure to discuss your treatment costs with the doctors and nurses conducting the clinical trial."
What Are the Disadvantages of Participating in a Clinical Trial?,"'Because the drug or device being studied is new, all of the risks and side effects of the treatment are not known at the beginning of the clinical trial. There may be unknown side effects (as well as hoped-for benefits). Patients will be informed of any known side effects they could experience, as well as any side effects that occur or become known while they are participating in the trial.''It is also important that you realize that if you participate in a clinical trial you may be given a placebo, which is a ''sugar'' pill containing no medicine. These tablets are used to determine if the real treatment is really working effectively. Trials are conducted in such a way that you will not be told if you\'re getting the real treatment or a ""fake"" treatment.' "
How Would My Care Be Different if I Participated in a Clinical Trial?," You may receive more exams and tests than are usually given for your particular condition. The purpose of these tests is to follow your progress and collect study data. Of course, tests can carry certain benefits and risks or discomforts of their own. Although they can be inconvenient, these tests can assure extra observation. Depending on the type of clinical trial, you may be asked to stop or change the medication(s) you are currently taking. You may also be asked to change your diet or any activities that could affect the outcome of the trial. As mentioned above, you could get the placebo rather than the real medicine."
What Is Informed Consent?,"'Informed consent means that as a patient, you are given all available information so you can understand what is involved in a specific clinical trial. The doctors and nurses conducting the trial will explain the treatment to you, including its possible benefits and risks.''You will be given an informed consent form to read and consider carefully. Before signing, be sure you find out as much as possible about the clinical trial, including what risks you may face. Ask the researchers to explain parts of the form or the trial that are not clear. (See ""Important Questions to Ask"" below.)''You are free to decide whether or not you want to take part in the trial. If you decide to participate, you will sign the consent form. If you do not want to participate in the trial, you may refuse. If you choose not to participate in the trial, your care will not be affected in any way.''Your signature on the informed consent form does not bind you to the study. Even if you sign the form, you are free to leave the trial at any time to receive other available treatments.''The informed consent process is ongoing. After you agree to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive any new information about your treatment that may affect your willingness to stay in the trial.' "
Who Can Participate in a Clinical Trial?,"'Every clinical trial is designed to meet a specific set of research criteria. Each study enrolls patients with certain conditions and symptoms. If you fit the guidelines for a trial, you may be able to participate. In some instances, you may be required to undergo certain tests to confirm that you are eligible.' "
What Is It Like to Participate in a Clinical Trial?,"'All patients face a new world of medical terms and procedures. Fears and myths of being experimented upon or being a guinea pig are common concerns of patients who are thinking about participating in a clinical trial.''Even though there are always going to be fears of the unknown, understanding what is involved in a clinical trial before agreeing to participate can relieve some of your anxieties.''This may help ease your concerns:' The personal information gathered about you during the clinical trial will remain confidential and will not be reported with your name attached. If at any time throughout the trial you and your doctor feel it is in your best interest to exit the trial and use other known treatments, you will be free to do so. This will not in any way affect your future treatment. Clinical trial participants typically receive their care in the same places that the standard treatments are given -- in clinics or doctor's offices. Clinical trial participants are watched closely, and information about you will be carefully recorded and reviewed."
Important Questions to Ask,"'If you are thinking about taking part in a clinical trial, find out as much as possible about the study before you decide to participate. Here are some important questions to ask:''For information about other ongoing '""Parkinson's""' disease studies, contact the National Institutes of Health.''WebMD Medical Reference' What is the purpose of the clinical trial? What kinds of tests and treatments does the clinical trial involve? How are these tests administered? What is likely to happen in my case with, or without, this new research treatment? (Are there standard treatment options in my case, and how does the study treatment compare with them?) How could the clinical trial affect my daily life? What side effects can I expect from the clinical trial? How long will the clinical trial last? Will the clinical trial require me to give up some of my personal time? If so, how much? Will I have to be hospitalized? If so, how often and for how long? If I agree to withdraw from the clinical trial, will my care be affected? Will I need to change doctors? If the treatment works for me, can I continue taking it after the trial?"
Introduction to eating right with Parkinson's disease,"'While there is no special ''diet'' required for people with '""Parkinson's""' disease, eating a well-balanced, nutritious ''diet'"" is extremely beneficial. With the proper diet, our bodies work more efficiently, we have more energy, and Parkinson's disease medications will work properly.""'This article addresses the basics of good ''nutrition''. Please consult your doctor or dietitian before making any dietary changes. A registered dietitian can provide in-depth ''nutrition'' education, tailor these general guidelines to meet your needs, and help you create and follow a personal meal plan.' "
The Basics of Eating Well," Eat a variety of foods from each food category. Ask your doctor if you should take a daily vitamin supplement. Maintain your weight through a proper balance of exercise and food. Ask your doctor what your ""goal"" weight should be and how many calories you should consume per day. Include high-fiber foods such as vegetables, cooked dried peas and beans (legumes), whole-grain foods, bran, cereals, pasta, rice, and fresh fruit in your diet. Choose foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Try to limit sugars. Moderate your use of salt. Drink eight 8 oz. glasses of water per day. Ask your doctor about drinking alcoholic beverages (alcohol may interfere with some of your medications)."
Medication and Food Interactions,"'The medication levodopa generally works best when taken on an empty stomach, about ½ hour before meals or at least one hour after meals. It should be taken with 4-5 oz. of water. This allows the drug to be absorbed in the body more quickly.''For some patients, levodopa may cause ''nausea'' when taken on an empty stomach. Therefore, your doctor may prescribe a combination of levodopa and ''carbidopa'' (called ''Sinemet'') or carbidopa by itself (called ''Lodosyn''). If ''nausea'' is a continual problem, your doctor may be able to prescribe another drug to relieve these symptoms. There are also tips listed below that can help relieve nausea.''Also, ask your doctor if you should change your daily protein intake. In rare cases, a diet high in protein limits the effectiveness of levodopa.' "
Controlling Nausea,"'There are several ways to control or relieve nausea, including:' Drink clear or ice-cold drinks. Drinks containing sugar may calm the stomach better than other liquids. Avoid orange and grapefruit juices because these are too acidic and may worsen nausea. Drink beverages slowly. Drink liquids between meals instead of during them. Eat light, bland foods (such as saltine crackers or plain bread). Avoid fried, greasy, or sweet foods. Eat slowly. Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. Do not mix hot and cold foods. Eat foods that are cold or at room temperature to avoid getting nauseated from the smell of hot or warm foods. Rest after eating, keeping your head elevated. Activity may worsen nausea and may lead to vomiting. Avoid brushing your teeth after eating. If you feel nauseated when you wake up in the morning, eat some crackers before getting out of bed or eat a high protein snack before going to bed (lean meat or cheese). Try to eat when you feel less nauseated. If these techniques do not seem to ease your queasy stomach, consult your doctor."
Relieving Thirst/Dry Mouth,"""Some Parkinson's disease medications may make you thirsty. Here are some tips for relieving ""'thirst'' and ''dry mouth'':' Drink eight or more cups of liquid each day. But, some people with Parkinson's disease who also have heart problems may need to limit their fluids, so be sure to follow your doctor's guidelines. Limit caffeine (contained in coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate) as it may interfere with some of your medications and may actually make you more dehydrated. Dunk or moisten breads, toast, cookies, or crackers in milk, decaffeinated tea or coffee to soften them. Take a drink after each bite of food to moisten your mouth and to help you swallow. Add sauces to foods to make them soft and moist. Try gravy, broth, sauce, or melted butter. Eat sour candy or fruit ice to help increase saliva and moisten your mouth. Don't use a commercial mouthwash. Commercial mouthwashes often contain alcohol that can dry your mouth. Ask your doctor or dentist about alternative mouthwash products.

Facts you should know about mumps (parotitis)," Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection. Mumps has an incubation period of 14-18 days from exposure to onset of symptoms. The duration of the disease is approximately seven to 10 days. The initial symptoms of mumps infection are nonspecific (low-grade fever, malaise, headache, muscle aches, and loss of appetite). The classic finding of parotid gland tenderness and swelling generally develops the third day of illness. The diagnosis is generally made without the need for laboratory tests. Serious health complications of mumps include meningitis, encephalitis, deafness, and orchitis. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine provides 88% effective immunity against mumps following a two-dosage schedule (12-15 months with booster at 4-6 years of age). A single mumps vaccination protects approximately 78% of individuals against the disease. No specific treatment exists for mumps. Warm or cold packs for the parotid gland tenderness and swelling is helpful. Pain relievers (acetaminophen [Tylenol] and ibuprofen [Advil]) are also helpful. "
What is mumps?,"'Mumps is a vaccine-preventable viral infection transmitted by and affecting only humans. While the salivary glands (especially the parotid gland at the sides of the cheeks) are well known to be involved during a mumps infection, many other organ systems may also experience effects of the virus infection. There is no cure for mumps, but the illness is of short duration (seven to 10 days) and resolves spontaneously. Prior to the introduction of mumps immunization, the highest incidence of new cases of mumps was reported in the late winter to early spring.'  "
What is the history of mumps?,"'Medical historians believe that documentation of a clinical illness consistent with mumps dates back to Greco-Roman times. The first effective vaccine against mumps was introduced in 1948 and used from 1950-1978. Unfortunately, this vaccine strain had limited long-term immune memory effectiveness. The current strain used in the United States and worldwide provides 88% long-term immunity. The current childhood mumps immunization schedule recommends vaccination at 12-15 months old and a booster at 4-6 years of age. The mumps vaccine is commonly administered as part of a combination vaccine (MMR) also providing protection against ''measles'' and ''rubella'' (''German measles'').''Prior to the routine administration of the MMR vaccine, approximately 186,000 cases per year were documented in the United States. With immunization, that number has fallen to 2,015 cases in 2015. Recently, there have been outbreaks of mumps in Washington state.' "
What causes mumps? Is mumps contagious? How is mumps transmitted?,"'Mumps virus is a single strand of RNA housed inside a two-layered envelope that provides the virus its characteristic immune signature. Only one type of mumps virus has been demonstrated to exist (in contrast to the many virus types that can cause the ''common cold'').''Mumps is highly contagious on the order of magnitude of both ''influenza'' and ''rubella'' (German measles). It is, however, less contagious than measles and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox''). It is transmitted only from human to human. Mumps has a rapid spread among members living in close quarters. The virus most commonly is spread directly from one person to another via respiratory droplets expelled during ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''. Less frequently, the respiratory droplets may land on fomites (sheets, pillows, clothing) and then be transmitted via hand-to-mouth contact after touching such items. Animals cannot contract or spread mumps.' "
What is the incubation period for mumps?,'There is a 14-18-day period between contracting the mumps virus and onset of symptoms and signs. Viral shedding is short lived and a patient should be isolated from other susceptible individuals for the first five days following the onset of swelling of the salivary (parotid) glands.' 
What is the contagious period for mumps?,'The highest likelihood of spreading mumps covers the period of two days before the onset of symptoms and the first five days of parotid gland swelling and tenderness.' 
How long does mumps last?,'Routine cases of mumps last approximately seven to 10 days.' 
What are risk factors for contracting mumps?," Failure to vaccinate completely (two separate doses) with exposure to those with mumps Age: The highest risk of contracting mumps is to a child between 2-12 years of age. Season: Outbreaks of mumps were most likely during the winter/spring seasons. Travel to high-risk regions of the world: Africa, general Indian subcontinent region, and Southeast Asia. These areas have a very low rate of immunization. Weakening immune system: either due to diseases (for example, HIV/AIDS, cancer) or medication (oral steroid use for more than two weeks, chemotherapy) Born before 1956: Generally, these individuals are believed to have experienced mumps infection in childhood. However, if they did not, they are at risk for adult mumps disease. Adult mumps is associated with a more intense disease and higher rate of certain side effects (such as inflammation of testicles, or orchitis). A blood test may be obtained to determine immunity and is worthwhile if any doubt exists regarding prior mumps infection."
What does mumps look like?,'The unique physical exam findings seen in those with mumps is swelling and tenderness of one or both parotid glands on the sides of the face. The parotid glands are imbedded into the cheeks in front of the ear where a large set of sideburns would be. Less commonly affected are the salivary glands located under the lower jaw (mandible) or under the tongue (sublingual salivary glands).' 
What are the signs and symptoms of mumps in children and adults?,"'Nonspecific symptoms of low-grade ''fever'', ''headache'', muscle aches (''myalgia''), reduced appetite, and malaise occur during the first 48 hours of mumps infection. Parotid gland swelling characteristically is present on day three of illness. (The parotid gland is a salivary gland located anterior to the ear and above the angle of the jaw -- imagine a large set of sideburns.) The parotid gland is swollen and tender to touch, and referred ''pain'' to the ear may also occur. Parotid gland swelling may last up to 10 days, and adults generally experience worse symptoms than children. Approximately 95% of individuals who develop symptoms of mumps will experience tender inflammation of their parotid glands.''Interestingly about 15%-20% of mumps cases have no clinical evidence of infection, and 50% of patients will have only nonspecific respiratory symptoms and not the characteristic description above. Adults are more likely to experience such a subclinical or respiratory-only constellation of symptoms while children between 2-9 years of age are more likely to experience the classic presentation of mumps with parotid gland swelling.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose mumps?,"'The diagnosis of mumps is primarily one of clinical acumen. Laboratory studies are generally done to support the clinical impression. The purpose of these laboratory studies is to exclude other ''viruses'' that may give a similar clinical presentation as well as to exclude very infrequent similarly presenting parotid gland enlargement (for examples, ''salivary gland cancer'"", Sjögren's syndrome, IgG-4 related disease, ""'sarcoidosis'', side effects of ''thiazide diuretics'', etc.).' "
What is the medical treatment for mumps in adults and in children?,"'The mainstay of treatment (regardless of age range) is to provide comfort for this self-limited disease. Taking analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) and applying warm or cold packs to the swollen and inflamed salivary gland region may be helpful.'  "
What types of health care professionals treat mumps?,"'Most cases of mumps are not complicated and thus may be managed by health care professionals such as pediatricians, internists, or family practice doctors. An infectious-disease specialist may need to be consulted for unusual health circumstances or medically complicated patients.' "
What are complications of mumps?,"'There are four serious health complications of mumps: meningitis (infection of the spinal fluid which surrounds the brain and spinal cord), ''encephalitis'' (infection of the brain substance), deafness, and orchitis (infection of the testicle/testicles). All four complications may occur without the patient experiencing the classic involvement of the parotid gland.''Less frequent health complications of mumps infection include ''arthritis'', infection of the pancreas, infection of the ''myocardium'' (''heart'' muscle), and neurological conditions (for example, facial palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, etc.).' Meningitis: More than half of patients with mumps will have meningitis, which may occur during any period of the disease. Generally patients make a full recovery without permanent health side effects. Encephalitis: Until the 1960s, mumps was the primary cause of confirmed viral encephalitis in the United States. Since the successful introduction of a vaccination program, the incidence of mumps encephalitis has fallen to 0.5%. Fortunately, most patients recover completely without permanent medical side effects. Deafness: Preceding the mumps immunization program, permanent nerve damage resulting in deafness was not unusual. While occasionally bilateral, more commonly only one ear was affected. Orchitis: This complication was the most common side effect to postpubertal males who contracted mumps. Severe pain (often requiring hospitalization for pain management) was one-sided in most cases. Some affected testicles atrophied (decreased in size), and some demonstrated impaired fertility. The ""common knowledge"" of sterility was actually rare. Previous concerns regarding mumps orchitis and later development of testicular cancer have not been proven. (Ovarian involvement has been reported to occur in some postpubertal women.)"
Is it possible to prevent mumps? Is there a vaccine for mumps?,"'Prior to the start of mumps vaccination in 1948, outbreaks during the winter/spring would commonly affect young schoolchildren with secondary spread to other family members not yet immune. Until an effective vaccine program was introduced, isolation of the infected individual was the only public health control option. The current MMR strain used in the United States and other developed countries was licensed in 1967. Another strain is more commonly used in developing countries. Both ''strains'' provide approximately 88% immunity following the two-vaccination schedule detailed below. A single dose of mumps vaccine provides immunity to only 78% of recipients.''The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends a combination vaccine (MMR) to children at 12 to 15 months of age with a booster dose at 4 to 6 years of age. During periods of possible mumps outbreaks, the booster dose may be administered after a minimum of 28 days following the initial immunization. The MMR immunization is designed to prevent measles, mumps, and ''rubella'' (German measles). Adults born after 1956 should receive at least one MMR vaccination. Those born prior to 1956 are generally found to have acquired natural immunity and no vaccination is necessary.''More common side effects of the MMR vaccine include stinging/burning at the injection site, mild fever, and mild skin ''rash''. The fever and skin ''rash'' most commonly develop five to 12 days postvaccination and occur more commonly after the first vaccination. Some recipients of the vaccine will note mild enlargement and tenderness of local (for example, neck) ''lymph nodes''. It should be noted that these relatively common side effects are considerably less severe than acquiring any of the three illnesses the MMR vaccine is designed to prevent. In extremely rare situations, more severe reactions affecting the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and digestive organs, the skin, and others may occur.'  "
Who should not get vaccinated with the MMR?,"'A very small population should not receive the MMR vaccine. These include individuals with a compromised immune system (''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', those receiving more than two continuous weeks of oral steroids) or who are ''allergic'' to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or ''neomycin''. MMR ''vaccines'' are very unlikely to produce a severe reaction to those who are egg white allergic. Daily use of inhaled steroids (such as those used to control certain pulmonary diseases such as ''asthma'', ''COPD'', etc.) is not a contraindication to the MMR vaccine. Patients with a mild illness (for example, the ''common cold'') may safely receive the MMR vaccine. ''Conception'' should be avoided until at least 28 days following vaccination.''Multiple international studies have not demonstrated any causative relationship between administration of the MMR vaccine and the development of ''autism'', disproving previous erroneous theories.' "
What is the prognosis of a mumps infection?,"'Mumps is generally a benign self-limited disease that produces lifelong immunity. Severe medical side effects are extremely rare; more common complications (though still relatively rare) are listed above. Non-immune women who contract mumps during the ''first trimester'' of their ''pregnancy'' have an increased rate of ''miscarriage'', but infants carried to term have no higher risk for ''congenital malformations''.' "
Where can people find more information on mumps?,"'The CDC web site (''http://www.cdc.gov'') provides an excellent resource for the disease and vaccination program for mumps and many other common infectious diseases. In addition, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (''http://www.aap.org'') also provides valuable information for the medically trained and nonmedically trained individual.' "
Can people get mumps twice?,"'Since there is only a single mumps virus in existence, lifelong immunity is generally acquired after a mumps infection. Ways to document mumps immunity include''Mumps immunity after complete vaccination is approximately 88%. A boost in immunity occurs when exposed to an individual with an active case of mumps.' born before 1957, diagnosis of mumps by a physician, and laboratory confirmation of previous mumps virus exposure."
What is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)?,"'Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH is a rare and chronic disease that results in an abnormal breakdown of red blood cells. PNH is due to a spontaneous genetic mutation that causes red blood cells to be deficient in a protein, leaving them fragile. Because the kidneys help to filter out waste products from red cell breakdown, when urine is concentrated overnight as a person with PNH sleeps, the morning urine may be reddish to a darker, cola color. This led to term the problem as ""nocturnal."" One of the red blood cell products that the kidneys metabolize into the urine is ''hemoglobin'' (hence, ""hemoglobinuria""). Because urine discoloration occurs irregularly due to physiological changes, the disease was thought to occur irregularly and so was termed ""paroxysmal."" ' "

It is most frequently found in adults with the median age of diagnosis being 45 years old.' "
How is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) inherited?,"'PNH is not inherited. It is due to a spontaneous genetic mutation that occurs in the PIGA gene. The mutation makes stem cells that are deficient in a protein. Mutated stem cells that are not malignant (cancerous) can still increase in numbers by normal clonal expansion to produce red blood cells that are not normal. If the mutated stem cells increase in numbers, then PNH symptoms can develop. There may be other factors that are not well understood that encourage the proliferation of the mutated stem cells. Experts suggest the factors causing bone marrow failure may play a role in PNH development since there is a close association between PNH cells and the development of aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Because PNH is not inherited, individuals do not pass the spontaneously mutated gene to their children.' "

What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump. A coordinated electrical signal is required for the heart muscle cells to contract in a coordinated way and generate a heartbeat. Normally, an electrical signal is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells found in the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the ''right atrium'' or upper chamber of the heart. This impulse spreads to the whole atrial muscle causing it to contract and push blood into the ventricle or the lower chamber of the heart. The electrical signal continues to a junction box between the ''atrium'' and ventricle (the ''AV node''), where there is a slight delay that allows the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood to the body. The signal continues throughout the ventricles and causes them to beat and push blood to the body. '  "
What causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), abnormal conduction of that electricity causes the ''atrium'', and secondarily the ventricles, to beat very rapidly. It is referred to as paroxysmal, because the rapid rate can occur sporadically and without warning and may also stop on its own. The rapid heartbeat may last a few seconds or many hours. Often the PSVT resolves before the patient reaches a health care professional.''In many patients with PSVT, there is a “wiring” problem in the ''AV node'' and instead of having just one pathway for electricity to travel to the ventricle, there are two. This allows electricity to circle back and cause the ''atrium'' to beat more quickly than it should normally. PSVT is one of many electrical abnormalities that cause the atrium to beat too quickly. These abnormalities were once lumped together and called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or PAT but, as more has been learned about the electrical wiring of the heart, terminology has been updated to better reflect the specific abnormal rhythm.''Some examples include''As well, there are numerous abnormalities in the ''AV node'' that cause rapid heartbeats and ''palpitations''. PSVT and other electrical abnormalities located in the atrium or AV node should not be confused with ventricular tachycardia, which arises from the ventricle and is potentially life-threatening.' atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome."
What are the symptoms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'One of the most common symptom of\xa0PSVT is heart ''palpitations'', often described as a ""rapid heartbeat."" There can also be a fullness in the throat that is associated with the rapid heartbeat.''Other symptoms include the following:''The symptoms of PSVT usually occur while the heart is beating quickly, but the ''fatigue'' can persist after the heartbeat returns to normal. By its nature, PSVT is intermittent and its onset cannot be predicted. As well, once the heart starts to beat quickly, there is no way of predicting if and when it will return to normal rhythm on its own. Some patients are unaware that their heart is beating quickly and PSVT is found only when the patient presents for care and is found to have a rapid heartbeat.'   Lightheadedness, Weakness and fatigue Shortness of breath Chest pressure Syncope (passing out)"
How is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of PSVT is based upon interpretation of the heart rate monitor and ''electrocardiogram''.'""Sometimes the diagnosis is difficult because the rapid heart rate resolves before the patient presents for medical care. In these cases, where there is a recurrent pattern of palpitations, the healthcare professional may suggest monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm as an outpatient. A Holter monitor is a small device that can be worn for 24 or 48 hours that records every heartbeat and may give a clue as to the underlying cause of the palpitations.""'A 30-day event monitor may also be considered, which gives a longer window to detect the rhythm. Again, a small monitor is worn, but with this device the patient triggers the recording when the palpitations begin. In some cases, specialized electrophysiology tests may be necessary to monitor the heart and try to reproduce abnormal rhythms.''For infrequent events, an implantable device (LINQ) can be placed just under the skin, and can scan for a month looking for rare rhythm changes.'  "
What is the treatment for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'There is a stepwise approach to treating the rapid heartbeat of PSVT. ''Vasovagal'"" maneuvers stimulate the vagus nerve and can slow the heart rate. Some options include holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement or splashing ""'cold'' water on the face. A care professional might cautiously ''massage'' the carotid artery in the neck, but in older patients, there is a risk of ''stroke'' and this procedure is usually reserved for younger patients.''Depending upon the heart rhythm, medications can be injected intravenously to reset the AV node or to decrease heart muscle excitability. Adenosine is a short-acting medication that is commonly used as a first-line drug to treat PSVT. Other treatment options for other atrial tachycardias include ''calcium channel blockers'', ''beta blockers'', ''digoxin'', and ''amiodarone''.''If the PSVT does not convert with intravenous medication or if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' or complains of ''chest pain'' or shortness of breath, ''cardioversion'' may be required. This means that an electrical ''shock'"" is given that resets the heart's electrical system to beat with a regular rate and rhythm.""  "
How can paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) be prevented?,"'PSVT can result because of underlying medical conditions or because of foods and medications that are ingested. ''Caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and ''over-the-counter'"" (OTC) cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine can stimulate and irritate the heart's electrical conduction system and precipitate an episode of PSVT. Decreasing or avoiding use of these chemicals completely may prevent PSVT. ""'Electrolytes'' abnormalities can cause heart electrical irritability. Abnormal thyroid levels can also precipitate ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Medications can be used to minimize the recurrence of PSVT, including calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or other antiarrhythmic medications.'""If PSVT continues to recur, an electrophysiologic study (EPS) can be done by a cardiologist and the electrical system of the heart can be mapped. If abnormal tracts or short circuits are found, they can be ablated or destroyed with high frequency radio waves and hopefully, prevent future episodes of PSVT. This is often a highly effective modality for patients with recurrent episodes who don't wish to have to take long-term medication."" "
What is and what causes Parry-Romberg syndrome?,"'Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive deterioration (atrophy) of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face (hemifacial atrophy), usually the left side. It is more common in females than in males. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Parry-Romberg syndrome?,"'Initial facial changes usually involve the tissues above the upper jaw (maxilla) or between the nose and the upper corner of the lip (nasolabial fold) and subsequently progress to the angle of the mouth, areas around the eye, the brow, the ear, and the neck. The deterioration may also affect the tongue, the soft and fleshy part of the roof of the mouth, and the gums. The eye and cheek of the affected side may become sunken and facial hair may turn white and fall out (''alopecia''). In addition, the skin overlying affected areas may become darkly pigmented (''hyperpigmentation'') with, in some cases, areas of hyperpigmentation and patches of unpigmented skin (''vitiligo''). Parry-Romberg syndrome is also accompanied by neurological abnormalities including ''seizures'' and episodes of severe facial ''pain'' (''trigeminal neuralgia''). '  "
At what age does Parry-Romberg syndrome occur?,"'The onset of the disease usually begins between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The progression of the atrophy often lasts from 2 to 10 years, and then the process seems to enter a stable phase. Muscles in the face may atrophy and there may be bone loss in the facial bones. Problems with the ''retina'' and ''optic nerve'' may occur when the disease surrounds the eye.' "
Is there any treatment for Parry-Romberg syndrome?,'There is no cure and there are no treatments that can stop the progression of Parry-Romberg syndrome. Reconstructive or microvascular surgery may be needed to repair wasted tissue. The timing of surgical intervention is generally agreed to be the best following exhaustion of the disease course and completion of facial growth. Most surgeons will recommend a waiting period of one or two years before proceeding with reconstruction. Muscle or bone grafts may also be helpful. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.'  
What is the prognosis for Parry-Romberg syndrome?,"'The prognosis for individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome varies. In some cases, the atrophy ends before the entire face is affected. In mild cases, the disorder usually causes no disability other than cosmetic effects.' "

What are dentures?," When a person is missing teeth, he or she may experience a variety of problems. The person may become less confident in their smile and have difficulty speaking and eating certain foods. Dentures are appliances that are custom made to replace a person's missing teeth and restore the appearance and oral functions that were lost. The denture can be either a full denture or a partial denture. A full denture is used when all of the person's teeth are missing and a partial denture is used when only some of the teeth are missing."
What are the different types of dentures?,"'Complete Dentures:'' Complete dentures are made of a ''plastic'' base that is colored in order to replicate gum tissue and supports a full set of plastic or porcelain teeth. The traditional full denture is held in the mouth by forming a seal with the gums. They can also be held in place by attaching to ''dental implants'' that are surgically placed in the bone of the jaws. This treatment is much more expensive than the traditional complete denture.''Partial Dentures:'' Partial dentures can either be made with a plastic base or a metal framework that supports the number of teeth that need to be replaced. It is held in the mouth by using clasps and rests that are carefully adapted around the natural teeth. The partial denture that uses a metal framework is the traditional design, due to the rigidity and strength of the metal.  Plastic partial dentures have normally been used as emergency or temporary replacements of missing teeth, allowing the gums and bone to heal before a definitive restorative solution is obtained. Recently, however, various materials such as Valplast have been developed to provide durable, flexible alternatives in certain situations.'  "
How are dentures made?,"'After a tooth is extracted or lost, the tooth socket starts to fill in with bone and the gum tissue heals and changes shape. This process takes a few months until the gums and bone reach a stable shape. After this time a conventional full denture is made, preferably about 8 to 12 weeks after the teeth were extracted or lost from the mouth. '""The process starts by taking a series of impressions or molds of the oral tissues that will support the denture. A dental lab will use these impressions to make models of the patient's mouth. The dentist and laboratory technician will then slowly start building the dentures on these models and transferring them to the patient's mouth at each step to ensure proper fit, establish a proper bite, and ensure that the appearance and esthetics of the denture are desirable. The patient will generally need to be seen by the dentist once per week for about 4 to 5 weeks until the denture is complete. The patient will then need to return occasionally during the first month after the denture is delivered to have adjustments made.""""An immediate denture can often be made so that the patient has something to wear the same day the teeth are removed. This type of denture is made before the teeth are extracted and is put in  place the day the teeth are removed. Sometimes the back teeth are taken out first and the front teeth are left in place until the day the denture is delivered. This type of denture doesn't fit the bone and gum tissue as intimately as a conventional denture, so it requires more adjustments during the healing stage. An immediate denture is best used as a temporary appliance until a conventional denture can be made after all of the gum and bone healing is complete."" "
Are there alternatives to dentures?,"'There are two other ways missing teeth can be replaced -- with ''bridges'' and implants.''Bridges:'' A ''bridge'' replaces missing teeth by placing crowns on the teeth next to the space and attaching a fake tooth to both of the crowns. Bridges are made from gold, porcelain fused to gold, all porcelain, or zirconium. Bridges can only replace about two to three missing teeth in a row, depending on the location. Since bridges are cemented in place, they are considered a ""fixed, or permanent denture.""''Implants:'' An implant is a metal post that is inserted into the bone of the upper or lower jaw. This post is then used to replace a single tooth by attaching a ''crown'' to it, or multiple teeth by attaching a bridge to multiple implants. Implants are the most expensive option for tooth replacement, but implants simulate natural teeth better than any of the other options.' "
"Will dentures affect the way of a person looks, feels, eats, and speaks?","""Dentures can restore or even enhance a person's appearance and be virtually undetectable. It takes some time to find the best way to insert and take out the dentures, and the gums will be a little sore in places at first. It is very important to return to the dentist often during the first few weeks to adjust the parts of the denture that are irritating the oral tissues. ""'Eating with the dentures in place requires some practice. It is best to start with soft foods, chewing food equally on both sides of the mouth and slowly introducing more solid foods. Chewy or sticky foods should be avoided. Once the cheeks and tongue get used to the denture, they will begin to automatically help keep the denture in place.  ''Speaking also requires practice but will become easier with repetition. With exaggerated movements such as yawning or laughing, the denture may become dislodged at first. If it continues, the denture may need to be adjusted or relined (refit). The denture may cause an increased production of saliva at first, but it will reduce back to normal.  '  "
Are dentures worn all day?,"'Dentures are generally worn during the day and taken out at night to give the oral tissues time to relax. During the first few days after receiving the denture, however, it needs to remain in the mouth even when sleeping to best identify areas that need to be adjusted. This is especially important after receiving an immediate denture, for the gum tissues will swell after the teeth are extracted or lost and then may not permit the denture to be reinserted if taken out.' "
How do you clean and care for dentures?,"'Dentures must be handled with great care and placed in a container of water or denture cleaner when not being worn. They should never be placed in hot water, for they can be damaged or warped. They must be cleaned daily using a soft ''toothbrush'' with soap and water. The mouth should be rinsed daily without the dentures in place to clean off any plaque and reduce the risk of infection like ''candidiasis''.''There are a lot of different denture products that can be purchased at any drugstore to help with caring for and cleaning dentures.' "
Should I use denture adhesive?,"""Denture adhesive is a paste or glue that helps the denture adhere to the supporting tissues instead of relying on suction or clasps. Sometimes the adhesive is called denture cream. A small amount of denture adhesive can be applied evenly to the clean surface of a denture to enhance stability and retention. It shouldn't be used to compensate for a poor-fitting denture or as an alternative to visiting the dentist for regular checkups."" "
Are dentures affordable? How much do dentures cost?,'Denture prices vary widely depending on the materials used. One can expect to pay at least a couple thousand dollars for a set of dentures.'  
Does dental insurance cover the cost of dentures?,"'Most dental insurance companies cover some or all of the cost of dentures, making them very affordable. The insurance company should be contacted to determine the exact amount of coverage.' "
How long do dentures last?,"'If cared for properly, dentures should last a minimum of 5 years. Over time, the bone shrinks and causes the denture to become loose. The rate that this happens varies with each individual, but can be controlled by visiting a dentist regularly to ensure that the denture is fitting properly.  An ill-fitting denture causes the bone to shrink more rapidly. To prolong the life of a denture, a dentist will often use a denture liner to refit the internal surface of the denture to the oral tissues.''Minor ''fractures'' in the teeth or acrylic base can usually be repaired by a dental lab in 1 to 2 days. Denture repair kits are even sold at most drugstores and online to fix minor cracks or replace loose teeth. Repairing the denture properly can be complicated, however, so if denture problems are noticed, it is best to contact a general dentist as soon as possible to arrange the denture repair.' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.'

What is alopecia areata?,'Alopecia areata is an acquired skin disease that can affect all hair-bearing skin and is characterized by localized areas of non-scarring alopecia (''hair loss'').' Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other medical problems. Most often these bald areas regrow their hair spontaneously. Alopecia areata is rare before 3 years of age. There seems to be a significant inherited predisposition for the development of alopecia areata.
What causes alopecia areata?,"""Current evidence suggests that alopecia areata is caused by an abnormality in the immune system that damages hair follicles. This particular abnormality leads to autoimmunity, a misguided immune system that tends to attack its own body. As a result, the immune system attacks particular tissues of the body. In alopecia areata, for unknown reasons, the body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Biopsies of affected skin show immune lymphocytes penetrating into the hair bulb of the hair follicles."" Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other autoimmune conditions such asthyroid disease,vitiligo,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andulcerative colitis. thyroid disease, vitiligo, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis or treatment of these diseases is unlikely to affect the course of alopecia areata. Sometimes, alopecia areata occurs within family members, suggesting a role of genes."
What are the signs and symptoms of the different patterns of alopecia areata?,"   The most common pattern is one or more well-defined spots of hair loss on the scalp. If alopecia occurs in an ophiasis pattern (hair loss involving the temporal and posterior scalp) or if large areas of the scalp are involved for long periods of time, the prognosis is worse. A more generalized form of hair loss is referred to as diffuse alopecia areata where there is widespread dramatic thinning of the scalp hair. Occasionally, all of the scalp hair is entirely lost, a condition referred to as alopecia totalis. Less frequently, the loss of all of the hairs on the entire body, called alopecia universalis, occurs."
Who is affected by alopecia areata?," Alopecia areata tends to occur most often in adults 30 to 60 years of age. However, it can also affect older individuals and, rarely, young children. Alopecia areata is not contagious. It should be distinguished from hair shedding that may occur following the discontinuation of hormonal estrogen and progesterone therapies for birth control or the hair shedding associated with the end of pregnancy. There are a number of treatable conditions that could be confused with alopecia areata."
How do health care professionals diagnose alopecia areata?," The characteristic finding of alopecia areata is one or more well-circumscribed areas of otherwise normal, hairless skin in hair-bearing areas. Occasionally, it may be necessary to biopsy the scalp to confirm the diagnosis. Other findings that may be helpful are the appearance of short hairs that presumably represent fractured hairs, short thin hairs, and gray hair growing in a bald area. Other causes of hair loss are generally excluded from the consideration by history and clinical evaluation."
What is the treatment for alopecia areata?,"'The course of typical alopecia areata is not predictable with a high likelihood of spontaneous remission. The longer the period of time of hair loss and the larger the area involved, the less likely the hair will regrow spontaneously. Therefore, there are a variety of treatments, but none of these can confidently be predicted to impact the course of this disease.'   Local steroid injections intracutaneously may be very helpful in restarting the hair growth cycle in treated areas. Steroid creams, lotions, and shampoos have been used for many years but are of limited benefit at best. Although oral systemic steroids are known to induce hair growth in affected patients, their long-term use is contraindicated because of the likelihood of undesirable side effects. The topical sensitizers, diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutylester, have been used in those suffering from recalcitrant alopecia areata or those with more than 50% hair loss. The goal of treatment is to create an allergic contact dermatitis of the scalp. This alteration in the immune response occasionally is accompanied by hair regrowth. The efficacy of the topical sensitizers has been demonstrated in both young children and adults, but it probably works less than half the time. Recent success using oral janus kinase inhibitors, including tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, and baricitinib, have been shown to be efficacious in severe, extensive alopecia areata in adults, but long-term therapy has potential side effects. The durability of response to these medications is variable, and most patients experience recurrence of hair loss after discontinuation. Perhaps topical therapy with these types of drugs may be available in the near future. There is no known effective method of prevention, although the elimination of emotional stress is felt to be helpful. No drugs or hair care products have been associated with the onset of alopecia areata. Although not precisely a treatment, the cosmetic camouflage of alopecia areata is certainly an important consideration in patient management. The damaging emotional effect of significant hair loss for both women and men can be considerable."
What is chondromalacia patella?,'Chondromalacia patella is abnormal softening of the cartilage of the underside the kneecap (patella). It is a cause of pain in the front of the knee (anterior ''knee pain''). Chondromalacia patella is one of the most common causes of chronic knee pain. Chondromalacia patella results from degeneration of cartilage due to poor alignment of the kneecap (patella) as it slides over the lower end of the thighbone (femur). This process is sometimes referred to as patellofemoral syndrome.'  
What causes chondromalacia patella?,"'The patella (kneecap) is normally pulled over the end of the femur in a straight line by the ''quadriceps'' (thigh) muscle. Patients with chondromalacia patella frequently have abnormal patellar ""tracking"" toward the lateral (outer) side of the femur. This slightly off-kilter pathway allows the undersurface of the patella to grate along the femur, causing chronic inflammation and pain. Certain individuals are predisposed to develop chondromalacia patella: females, knock-kneed or flat-footed runners, or those with an unusually shaped patella undersurface.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of chondromalacia patella?,"'The symptoms of chondromalacia patella are generally a vague discomfort of the inner front of the knee, aggravated by activity (''running'', jumping, climbing or descending stairs) or by prolonged sitting with knees in a moderately bent position (the so called ""theater sign"" of pain upon arising from a desk or theater seat). Some patients may also have a vague sense of ""tightness"" or ""fullness"" in the knee area. Occasionally, if chronic symptoms are ignored, the associated loss of quadriceps (thigh) muscle strength may cause the leg to ""give out."" Besides an obvious reduction in quadriceps muscle mass, mild swelling of the knee area may occur.'  "
How is chondromalacia patella diagnosed?,"'Chondromalacia patella is suspected in a person with anterior knee pain, especially in teenage females or young adults. With manual compression of the kneecap while the quadriceps muscle is tightened, there can be pain. This is referred to as the positive ""shrug"" sign. Generally, there is no associated swelling (''knee joint'' effusion).''X-rays'' or ''MRIs'' may be done to confirm the inflammation on the posterior part of the patella.' "
What is the treatment for chondromalacia patella?,"'The primary goal for treatment and rehabilitation of chondromalacia patella is to create a straighter pathway for the patella to follow during quadriceps contraction. Initial ''pain management'' involves avoiding motions which irritate the kneecap. Icing and anti-inflammatory medications (for examples, ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil''/''Motrin''] or ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) can be helpful.''Selective strengthening of the inner portion of the quadriceps muscle helps normalize the tracking of the patella. Cardiovascular conditioning can be maintained by stationary bicycling (low resistance but high rpms), pool running, or ''swimming'' (''flutter'' kick). Reviewing any changes in training prior to chondromalacia patella pain, as well as examining running shoes for proper biomechanical fit are critical to avoid repeating the painful cycle. Generally, full squat exercises with weights are avoided. Occasionally, bracing with patellar centering devices are required. Infrequently, surgical correction of knee alignment is considered.''Stretching and strengthening the quadriceps and ''hamstring muscle'' groups is critical for an effective and lasting rehabilitation of chondromalacia patella. ""Quad sets"" are the foundation of such a physical therapy program. Quad sets are done by contraction the thigh muscles while the legs are straight and holding the contraction for a count of 10. Sets of 10 contractions are done between 15-20 times per day.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) with chondromalacia patella?,"'Under optimal circumstances, the patient should have a rapid recovery and return at full functional level. Chondromalacia patella is not felt to be a precursor to ''degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'').' "
Is it possible to prevent chondromalacia patella?,"'Chondromalacia patella can be prevented only in the sense that the symptoms can be prevented by avoiding any aggravating activities (running, jumping, etc.) or positions.

What are atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale?,"'The ''heart'' has four chambers, the upper two called atria and the lower two called ventricles. The left and right atria are separated by a partition called the interatrial septum. This prevents the mixing of oxygenated blood in the ''left atrium'' with the deoxygenated blood in the ''right atrium''.\xa0''After a baby is born, generally, there is no communication between the two atria. Thus, the blood from the two sides of the heart is not mixed. In rare cases, there can be defects or holes in the septum between the atria. These holes can be of two types:' Atrial Septal Defect (ASD): ASD occurs when the septum wall does not grow completely before a baby is born. ASD can be of different sizes and the larger the defect, the more likely it is to cause problems. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO): As the name suggests, a patent foramen ovale happens when the normal hole in the wall between the left and right atria (foramen ovale) of a fetus fails to close after the birth. Foramen ovale is important in the fetus as it allows blood to bypass the fetal lungs, which cannot work until they are exposed to air. When a baby takes its first breath after its born, the foramen ovale closes, and within a few months, it seals completely in about 75% of babies. A PFO is generally smaller than an ASD, the symptoms in a person with a PFO may not be as obvious as in an ASD. In much of the people, a PFO does not cause any problem, even though blood mixes between the right and the left atrium. Problems, however, can occur when that blood contains a blood clot."
What is a percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect?,"'The symptoms of a Patent Foramen Ovale or atrial septal defect may be managed by medications. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\xa0''Options for surgical closure include open-heart surgery and percutaneous (through the skin) closure.\xa0' Percutaneous closure is a common surgery to treat patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD).  The surgery is done with the help of a special closure device.  The percutaneous closure procedures are monitored using an X-ray and an ultrasound camera inserted in the heart from a leg vein. The device is folded or attached on to a special flexible long tube (catheter).  The catheter can be inserted into a vein in the leg or groin and advanced into the heart and through the defect (ASD or PFO). The device is then gradually pushed out of the catheter allowing each side of the device to open up and cover each side of the hole in a way that the hole is sandwiched between the two opened parts of the device. This closes the hole or defect (ASD or PFO) and establishes a partition between the left and right atria.  Once the device is in a proper position, it is detached from the catheter.  As the heart tissue grows over the implant over time, the implant becomes a part of the heart."
What are the complications of percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect?,'The complications of the procedure include:' Bleeding Infections Embolism (a traveling blood clot that is formed at one site and lodges at another site in the body) Cardiac tamponade (compression of the heart by fluid accumulated around it) Loss of device Incomplete closure of the defect Air embolism (air bubbles trapped inside the blood vessels that may travel with the blood and may cause blockage of a small blood vessel in the body)
Pathological liar vs a compulsive liar,"'Below are the differences or symptoms between compulsive and pathological liars.''The success of the treatment depends upon whether the person actually agrees that they are a ‘compulsive liar’ or a ‘pathological liar.’ The treatment options may include:''The treatment options may sometimes be used in combination, depending on the underlying psychiatric condition.' Pathological liar: A liar lies incessantly to get their way and does so with little awareness.It is viewed as a coping mechanism developed in early childhood and is often associated with some other type of mental health disorder like an antisocial personality disorder. It could be that they lie to avoid something traumatic that happened in their lives, such as abuse, or the condition may be genetic.When it comes to pathological liars, it is observed that people who have an antisocial personality disorder (APD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) indulge in lying.A pathological liar is often goal-oriented (i.e., focused, one tells lies to get their way).They have very little regard or respect for the rights and feelings of others.They are often considered manipulative and cunning.They create extravagant stories that may be maintained or tweaked over time, and they often believe their own lies or have a weak grip on reality.Unlike the compulsive liar, pathological liars are near impossible to catch in the act. These people are excellent liars because they lie constantly and make stories up unnecessarily, and often, it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish the truth from false statements.Pathological liars know how to be confident while lying and use their pathological lying trait as a defense mechanism (e.g. they fix their gaze upon you rather than looking away).Some of the symptoms of a pathological liar are: they lie to gain something, they exaggerate things, they keep on changing their stories, and they live in a false sense of ‘reality.’ If confronted, they act defensive and never admit that they are liars.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) definition,"'Primary biliary ''cirrhosis'' (PBC) is a progressive disease of the ''liver'' caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (''cholestasis'') that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Over time, this pressure build-up destroys the bile ducts leading to liver cell damage. As the disease progresses and enough liver cells die, ''cirrhosis'' and liver failure occur.''Bile is manufactured in the liver and then transported through the bile ducts to the gallbladder and intestine where it helps digest ''fats'' and fat soluble ''vitamins'' (A,D,E,K). When bile cannot be drained from the liver, it causes inflammation that leads to cell death. ''Scar tissue'' gradually replaces the areas of damaged liver and then the body cannot perform necessary functions.'  "
What are the causes of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"""The cause of PBC is unknown. It is most likely an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks its own cells. In this disease, the bile ducts are under attack and are destroyed."" "
What are the risk factors for primary biliary cirrhosis?," There may be a 
	genetic component to the development of PBC since a 
	person 
with the disease is likely to have a family member also afflicted. Women are nine times more likely than men to develop PBC. It most often 
develops in the middle age between the ages of 40 to 60. The disease is seen more often in white, northern Europeans, compared 
to African-Americans."
What are the signs and symptoms for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'Up to a quarter of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are asymptomatic, meaning they do not have symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the disease is found incidentally because of abnormal ''liver blood tests''.''The most common initial symptoms are ''fatigue'' or a sense of being abnormally tired and, skin that itches. Because of the intense ''itching'' and scratching, the skin may become darkened and discolored in some areas. The person may also complain of ''dry mouth'' and eyes.''Because there may be liver inflammation, some people may experience right upper quadrant ''abdominal pain'', where the liver is located.''Should the liver damage progress, the symptoms of cirrhosis may develop. These include muscle wasting, ''ascites'' (swelling of the abdomen due to fluid accumulation), ''leg swelling'', ''jaundice'' (yellow coloration of the skin), and ''confusion''.'  "
How is the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis made?,"'The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis is considered when the doctor suspects that there might be liver inflammation based upon the history and physical examination. Initially there may be few symptoms like ''itching'' or ''fatigue'' to help guide further testing''The diagnosis may be made incidentally when abnormal liver functions be found on routine blood tests drawn for another reason. ''Liver function'' tests include AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), ''alkaline phosphatase'' and ''bilirubin''. Blood levels tend to become elevated in ''liver disease'' and they may rise in specific patterns depending upon the underlying cause of inflammation.''Once the diagnosis is suspected, a blood test to check for antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is usually done. This is positive in over 90% of patients with PBC.''Other blood tests may be considered including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and ''cholesterol levels''.''Imaging of the abdomen by ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' is often considered to look for structural changes in the liver and to search for tumors.''A ''liver biopsy'', where a thin needle is inserted through the skin to take a piece of liver tissue, may help confirm the diagnosis. This tissue is examined under a microscope by a pathologist to look for changes consistent with PBC. It is also useful to help stage the disease, deciding its severity at the time of diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The only ""cure"" for primary biliary cirrhosis is ''liver transplant'', but it is only considered as a treatment option if other less aggressive treatments have failed and the patient develops liver failure.''Ursodiol'' (Actigal) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line treatment for PBC. It helps the liver transport bile into the gallbladder and intestine, in an attempt to prevent ''cholestasis''.''Depending upon the severity of the disease, immune suppression medications may be prescribed, including ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' and ''prednisone''.''Itching may be intense and difficult to control. ''Antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may be helpful but other ''drugs'' may be considered including ''cholestyramine'' (''Questran'', ''Questran Light''), which helps bind bile and decrease the itching associated with elevated bilirubin levels in the blood.''Complications of PBC will need to be cared for. These include cirrhosis, ''portal hypertension'', gastrointestinal bleeding, ''osteoporosis'', and vitamin deficiencies.' "
What are the complications of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The complications of primary biliary cirrhosis develop as the ability of the liver to function decreases. Cirrhosis describes liver scarring and failure. The liver is responsible for helping to digest food, producing proteins, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that help digest food. Some complications include the following:''Ascites: ''Fluid collection within the abdomen that occurs because the liver cannot produce enough albumin, a protein that helps keep fluid within the blood vessels. Ascites fluid is prone to infection and a condition called spontaneous bacterial ''peritonitis'' (peritoneum=sac that contains the abdominal organs + itis=inflammation)''Edema'': Swelling of the legs may occur, again because of decreased albumin levels in the body''Easy bruising'' or bleeding: ''The liver is responsible for producing blood clotting factors. Without an adequate supply, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Patients may have a ''low platelet count'' because of an ''enlarged spleen'' causing ''easy bruising''.''Hepatic encephalopathy'': The liver also helps remove waste products from the bloodstream. Ammonia is the chemical waste product of protein metabolism and the body requires a healthy liver to metabolize it. If ammonia levels rise, confusion and lethargy (''encephalopathy'') may occur.''P''ortal ''hypertension'':'' An increase in pressure within the liver can cause blood flow issues leading to portal ''hypertension''. This may backup blood flow from other organs, causing ''splenomegaly'', an enlarged spleen, and varices, swollen veins, especially in the ''esophagus'' and stomach that can predispose to bleeding.''Osteoporosis'':'' PBC is also complicated by ''osteoporosis'', difficulty in absorbing nutrients, such as fat-soluble ''vitamin D'' and calcium, from the intestine.''Cancer'':''\xa0Some studies show patients with PBC are at an increased risk for hepatocellular ''carcinoma''.'  "
Can primary biliary cirrhosis be prevented?,"'Since the cause of the disease is not known, it is not possible to prevent PBC. However, medications may be able to slow the progression of the disease and control the symptoms.''Should a person develop PBC, all attempts should be made to prevent further potential damage. This may include limiting ''alcohol'' intake, avoiding the use of medications that contain ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'', Panadol), and ''cholesterol'' lowering agents.' "
What is the prognosis for someone with primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'PBC is a progressive disease that can be controlled but not cured. The prognosis depends upon a variety of factors including whether the patient has symptoms (especially ''fatigue''), liver function test abnormalities, and whether the patient has undergone treatment with medication or has required liver transplantation.''Advances in treatment have extended the life expectancy in the past many years. The average survival from diagnosis for a patient with PBC who is asymptomatic is 16 years, while that of patients with symptoms is 7 1/2 years.' "
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"'Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), also known by the name Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a hormonal problem that causes women to have a variety of symptoms. It should be noted that most women with the condition have a number of small ''cysts'' in the ovaries. However, women may have cysts in the ovaries for a number of reasons, and it is the characteristic constellation of symptoms, rather than the presence of the cysts themselves, that is important in establishing the PCOS diagnosis.''PCOS occurs in 5% to 10% of women and is the most common cause of''infertility''  in women. PCOS symptoms may begin in adolescence with menstrual irregularities , or a woman may not know she has PCOS until later in life when symptoms and/or ''infertility'' occur. Women of all ethnicities may be affected.' "
What are the symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"""PCOS's principal signs and symptoms are related to menstrual disturbances and elevated levels of male hormones (androgens). Menstrual disturbances can include delay of normal ""'menstruation'' (primary ''amenorrhea''), the presence of fewer than normal menstrual periods (oligomenorrhea), or the absence of ''menstruation'' for more than three months (secondary amenorrhea ). Menstrual cycles may not be associated with ''ovulation'' (anovulatory cycles) and may result in heavy bleeding.''Symptoms related to elevated ''androgen'' levels include ''acne'', excess hair growth on the body (hirsutism), and male-pattern ''hair loss''.''Other PCOS signs and symptoms include:''Any of the above symptoms and signs may be absent in PCOS, with the exception of irregular or no menstrual periods. All women with PCOS will have irregular or no menstrual periods. Women who have PCOS do not ovulate regularly; that is, they do not release an egg every month. This is why they do not have regular periods and typically have difficulty conceiving.'   obesity and weight gain, elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance, oily skin, dandruff, infertility, skin discolorations, high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, and multiple small cysts in the ovaries."
What causes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"'No one is quite sure what causes PCOS, and it is likely to be the result of a number of both genetic (''inherited'') as well as environmental factors. Women with PCOS often have a mother or sister with the condition, and researchers are examining the role that genetics or gene mutations might play in its development. The ovaries of women with PCOS frequently contain a number of small cysts, hence the name poly=many cystic ovarian syndrome. A similar number of cysts may occur in women without PCOS. Therefore, the cysts themselves do not seem to be the cause of the problem.'""A malfunction of the body's blood ""'sugar'' control system (insulin system) is frequent in women with PCOS, who often have insulin resistance and elevated blood insulin levels. Researchers believe that these abnormalities may be related to the development of PCOS. It is also known that the ovaries of women with PCOS produce excess amounts of male hormones known as androgens. This excessive production of male hormones may be a result of or related to the abnormalities in insulin production.''Another hormonal abnormality in women with PCOS is the excessive production of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is produced by the ''pituitary gland'', which is involved in stimulating the ovaries to produce hormones.''Other possible contributing factors in the development of PCOS may include a low level of chronic inflammation in the body and fetal exposure to male hormones.' "
How is PCOS diagnosed?,"'The PCOS diagnosis is generally made through clinical signs and symptoms. The doctor will want to exclude other illnesses that have similar features, such as ''low thyroid hormone'' blood levels (''hypothyroidism'') or elevated levels of a milk-producing hormone (''prolactin''). Also, tumors of the ovary or adrenal glands can produce elevated male hormone (androgen) blood levels that cause ''acne'' or excess hair growth, thus mimicking the symptoms of PCOS.''Other laboratory tests can be helpful in making the diagnosis of PCOS. Serum levels of male hormones ( DHEA and testosterone ) may be elevated. However, levels of testosterone that are highly elevated are common with PCOS and call for additional evaluation. Additionally, levels of luteinizing hormone involved in ovarian hormone production are elevated.''The cysts (fluid filled sacs) in the ovaries can be identified with imaging technology. (However, as noted above, women without PCOS can have many cysts as well.) ''Ultrasound'' , which passes sound waves through the body to create a picture of the kidneys, is used most often to look for cysts in the ovaries. Ultrasound imaging employs no injected dyes or ''radiation'' and is safe for all patients including ''pregnant'' women. It can also detect cysts in the kidneys of a fetus. Because women without PCOS can have ''ovarian cysts'' , and because ''ovarian cysts'"" are not part of the definition of PCOS, ultrasound is not routinely ordered to diagnose PCOS. The diagnosis is usually a clinical one based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory testing.""'More powerful and expensive imaging methods such as computed tomography (''CT scan'') and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') can also detect cysts, but they are generally reserved for situations in which other conditions that may cause related symptoms, such as ovarian or adrenal gland tumors are suspected. ''CT scans'' require ''X-rays'' and sometimes injected dyes, which can be associated with some degree of complications in certain patients.'  "
What conditions or complications can be associated with PCOS?,"'Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for a number of illnesses, including ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'' , and ''cancer of the uterus''(''endometrial cancer'').''Because of the menstrual and hormonal irregularities, infertility is common in women with PCOS. Because of the lack of ovulation, ''progesterone'' secretion in women with PCOS is diminished, leading to long-term unopposed estrogen stimulation of the uterine lining. This situation can lead to abnormal periods, breakthrough bleeding, or prolonged uterine bleeding. Unopposed estrogen stimulation of the uterus is also a risk factor for the development of endometrial hyperplasia and ''cancer of the endometrium'' (uterine lining). However, medications can be given to induce regular periods and reduce the estrogenic stimulation of the ''endometrium'' (see below).''Obesity is associated with PCOS. Obesity not only compounds the problem of insulin resistance and ''type 2 diabetes'' (see below), but also imparts cardiovascular risks. PCOS and obesity are associated with a higher risk of developing ''metabolic syndrome'' , a group of symptoms, including ''high blood pressure'', that increase the chances of developing ''cardiovascular disease''. It has also been shown that levels of ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP), a biochemical marker that can predict the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, are elevated in women with PCOS. Reducing the medical risks from PCOS-associated obesity is important.''The risk of developing ''prediabetes'' and ''type 2 diabetes'' is increased in women with PCOS, particularly if they have a family history of ''diabetes''. Obesity and insulin resistance, both associated with PCOS, are significant risk factor for the development of ''type 2 diabetes''. Several studies have shown that women with PCOS have abnormal levels of LDL (""bad"") ''cholesterol'' and lowered levels of ''HDL'' (""good"") cholesterol in the blood. Elevated levels of blood ''triglycerides'' have also been described in women with PCOS.''Changes in skin pigmentation can also occur with PCOS. ''Acanthosis nigricans'' refers to the presence of velvety, brown to black pigmentation often seen on the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. This condition is associated with obesity and insulin resistance and occurs in some women with PCOS.'  "
What treatments are available for PCOS?,"""Treatment of PCOS depends partially on the woman's stage of life. For younger women who desire ""'birth control'', the ''birth control pill'', especially those with low androgenic (male hormone-like) side effects can cause regular periods and prevent the risk of ''uterine cancer''. Another option is intermittent therapy with the hormone progesterone. Progesterone therapy will induce menstrual periods and reduce the risk of uterine ''cancer'', but will not provide ''contraceptive'' protection.''For ''acne'' or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') may be prescribed to help reverse these problems. The use of spironolactone requires occasional monitoring of blood tests because of its potential effect on the blood potassium levels and kidney function. ''Eflornithine'' (''Vaniqa'') is a prescription cream that can be used to slow facial hair growth in women.''Electrolysis'' and ''over-the-counter'' depilatory creams are other options for controlling excess hair growth.''For women who desire ''pregnancy'', a medication called ''clomiphene'' (''Clomid'') can be used to induce ovulation (cause egg production). In addition, ''weight loss'' can normalize menstrual cycles and often increases the possibility of pregnancy in women with PCOS. Other, more aggressive, treatments for infertility (including injection of gonadotropin hormones and assisted reproductive technologies) may also be required in women who desire pregnancy and do not become pregnant on Clomid therapy.''Metformin''(''Glucophage'') is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. This drug affects the action of insulin and is useful in reducing a number of the symptoms and complications of PCOS. Metformin has been shown to be useful in the management of irregular periods, ovulation induction, ''weight loss'', as well as the\xa0''prevention'' of type 2 diabetes and\xa0''gestational diabetes'' mellitus in women with PCOS.''Obesity that occurs with PCOS needs to be treated because it can cause numerous additional medical problems. The management of obesity in PCOS is similar to the management of obesity in general. ''Weight loss'' can help reduce or prevent many of the complications associated with PCOS, including type 2 diabetes and ''heart disease''. Consultation with a dietician on a frequent basis is helpful until just the right individualized program is established for each woman.''Finally, a surgical procedure known as ovarian drilling can help induce ovulation in some women who have not responded to other treatments for PCOS. In this procedure a small portion of ovarian tissue is destroyed by an electric current delivered through a needle inserted into the ovary. This is an older procedure which is only rarely utilized.'  "
What is PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient in that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA: ' Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied;  An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy; and  A pile of DNA building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."
How is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) done?,"'As illustrated in the ''animated picture of PCR'', three major steps are involved in a PCR. These three steps are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles. The cycles are done on an automated cycler, a device which rapidly heats and cools the test tubes containing the reaction mixture. Each step -- denatauration (alteration of structure), annealing (joining), and extension -- takes place at a different temperature: ''With one cycle, a single segment of double-stranded DNA template is amplified into two separate pieces of double-stranded DNA. These two pieces are then available for amplification in the next cycle. As the cycles are repeated, more and more copies are generated and the number of copies of the template is increased exponentially.' Denaturation: At 94 C (201.2 F), the double-stranded DNA melts and opens into two pieces of single-stranded DNA.  Annealing: At medium temperatures, around 54 C (129.2 F), the primers pair up (anneal) with the single-stranded ""template"" (The template is the sequence of DNA to be copied.) On the small length of double-stranded DNA (the joined primer and template), the polymerase attaches and starts copying the template.  Extension: At 72 C (161.6 F), the polymerase works best, and DNA building blocks complementary to the template are coupled to the primer, making a double stranded DNA molecule."
What is the purpose of doing a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'To do PCR, the original DNA that one wishes to copy need not be pure or abundant. It can be pure but it also can be a minute part of a mixture of materials. So, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses -- to diagnose genetic diseases, do DNA fingerprinting, find bacteria and ''viruses'', study human evolution, clone the DNA of an Egyptian mummy, establish paternity or biological relationships, etc.. Accordingly, PCR has become an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and many other laboratories that study genetic material.' "
How was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) discovered?,"'PCR was invented by Kary Mullis. At the time he thought up PCR in 1983, Mullis was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus, one of the first biotechnology companies. There, he was charged with making short chains of DNA for other scientists. Mullis has written that he conceived of PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway 128 one night on his motorcycle. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region. Mullis has said that before his motorcycle trip was over, he was already savoring the prospects of a Nobel Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith in 1993. ''As Mullis has written in the Scientific American: ""Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."" ' "
What is RT PCR?,"'RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA).

What is pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination is a method of preventing a specific type of lung infection (''pneumonia'') that is caused by the pneumococcus (''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'') bacterium. There are more than 80 different types of pneumococcus bacteria -- 23 of them covered by the ''vaccine''. The vaccine is injected into the body to stimulate the normal immune system to produce antibodies that are directed against pneumococcus bacteria.''This method of stimulating the normal immune system to be directed against a specific microbe is called immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination is also referred to as pneumococcal immunization.''Pneumococcal vaccination does not protect against ''pneumonia'' caused by microbes other than pneumococcus bacteria, nor does it protect against pneumococcal bacterial ''strains'' not included in the vaccine. It is reassuring to note that of the 80 different serotypes, the vast majority of infections are caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine.''In children, especially under 2 years of age, a special conjugated vaccine has been developed to stimulate less developed immune systems. Originally only covering seven serotypes, the newer vaccine released in 2010 now covers 13 serotypes of the pneumococcus (''Prevnar 13'').' "
Who should consider pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered by people in the following groups:' Adults 65 years of age and older People > 2 years of age with chronic heart or lung disorders, including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, alcoholism, spinal fluid leaks, cardiomyopathy, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or emphysema People > 2 years of age with spleen dysfunction (such as sickle cell disease) or lack of spleen function (asplenia), blood malignancy (leukemias), multiple myeloma, kidney failure, organ transplantation, or immunosuppressive conditions, including HIV infection Alaskan natives and certain American Indian populations If elective surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or immunosuppressive therapy is planned, the vaccine is given two weeks prior to the procedure, if possible."
Who should not receive pneumococcal vaccine? What about pregnancy?,"'The ''pneumococcal vaccine'' should not be received by people with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine.''The safety of the pneumococcus vaccine for ''pregnant'' women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before ''becoming pregnant'', if possible.' "
What are side effects of pneumococcal vaccine?,"'Pneumococcal vaccine uncommonly causes side effects. Reported side effects include''The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', ''chills'', and diffuse achiness.'   soreness and/or redness at the site of the injection, fever, rash, and allergic reactions."
How is pneumococcal vaccine administered?,"'The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a single injection in adults. The vaccine is injected as a liquid solution of 0.5 mL into the muscle (intramuscular or IM), typically deltoid muscle, or under the skin (subcutaneous or SC). The area injected is typically disinfected by rubbing ''alcohol'' onto the skin prior to the injection. The conjugated Prevnar 13 vaccine is given as a series of four injections in children.''People vaccinated prior to age 65 should be vaccinated at age 65 if five or more years have passed since the first dose. For people with a lack of spleen function (such as in sickle cell disease or after spleen removal), transplant patients, patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', immunosuppressed or immunodeficient people, and others at highest risk of fatal infection, a second dose should be given at least five years after first dose.' "
What if it is not clear what a person's vaccination history is?,"'When indicated, ''vaccines'' should be administered to patients with unknown vaccination status. All residents of ''nursing'' homes and other long-term care facilities should have their vaccination status assessed and documented.''Inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine and ''tetanus'' ''vaccines'' may be given at the same time as or at any time before or after a dose of pneumococcus vaccine. There are no requirements to wait between the doses of these or any other inactivated ''vaccines''.''In July 2000, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and the CDC jointly recommended childhood pneumococcal immunization, since pneumococcal infections are the most common invasive ''bacterial infections'' in children in the United States.''""The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, all adults 65 years or older, and persons 6 through 64 years of age with certain medical conditions,"" according to the 2014 AAP/CDC guidelines. ""Pneumovax is a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) that is currently recommended for use in all adults 65 years of age or older and for persons who are 2 years and older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, ''HIV'' infection, or other immunocompromising conditions). PPSV23 is also recommended for use in adults 19 through 64 years of age who smoke cigarettes or who have ''asthma''.""' "
What are the current recommendations for administration of pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adults?,"   Patients who are healthy and have never received the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine (PPSV23), if equal to or older than 65 years of age, should receive the PCV13 first and then within six months to a one year receive the PPSV23. Those who have already received the PPSV23, should get the PCV13 about one year later. If the person received the PPSV23 over five years earlier, they essentially should be treated as if they never received the vaccine, getting the PCV13 injection, followed about six to 13 months later by the PPSV23. In general, there seems to be a better immune response to the overlapping 13 strains of pneumococcus if the PCV13 is received first. The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, chills, and diffuse achiness."
What is Paget's disease?,"'Paget\'s disease is a chronic condition of bone characterized by disorder of the normal bone remodeling process. Normal bone has a balance of forces that act to lay down new bone and take up old bone. This relationship (referred to as ""bone remodeling"") is essential for maintaining the normal calcium levels in our blood. In bone affected by Paget\'s disease, one or more localized areas of bone are affected by abnormal bone remodeling, which is disturbed and not synchronized. As a result, the bone that is formed is abnormal, enlarged, not as dense, brittle, and prone to breakage (''fracture'').'""Paget's disease affects older skeletal bone of adults. It's estimated that 1% of adults in the U.S. have Paget's disease. There is also an extremely rare form of Paget's disease in children, referred to as juvenile Paget's disease. Paget's disease is also known as osteitis deformans and Paget disease."" "
What are the types of Paget's disease?,"'There are two types of '""Paget's disease of bone"""". When a single site of bone is affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the monostotic type. When multiple sites of bone are affected by Paget's disease, it is referred to as the polyostotic type."" "
What causes Paget's disease?,"""It is not known what causes Paget's disease. Paget's disease is felt to be a disease of a particular cell that is responsible for bone resorption, the osteoclast."" "
What are risk factors for Paget's disease?,"""The onset of Paget's disease is typically after 55 years of age. Recently, certain genes have been associated with Paget's disease, including the Sequestrosome 1 gene on chromosome 5. Virus infection may be necessary to trigger Paget's disease in people who have ""'inherited'"" the genetic tendency to develop the condition by having these genes. Paget's disease is inherited in approximately one-third of patients. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a patient with the condition to have a family history of the disease."" "
Who discovered Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is named after the English surgeon Sir James Paget, who described the condition in 1877. Paget also discovered the worm that causes ""'trichinosis'' and described what is called '""Paget's disease of the breast""'. Together with Rudolph Virchow in Germany, Paget was one of the founders of pathology.' "
What are Paget's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Paget's disease causes no symptoms in a majority of those with the condition and is often incidentally noted when X-ray tests are obtained for other reasons. However, Paget's disease can cause bone pain, deformity, fracture, and ""'arthritis'"". The bone pain of Paget's disease is located in the affected area of bone. The most common bones affected by Paget's disease include the spine, the thigh bone (femur), the pelvis, the skull, the collarbone (clavicle), and the upper arm bone (humerus). Fractures can occur because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone. Arthritis occurs because of the deformity of affected bone adjacent to the joint and because of bowing of affected long bones. The type of arthritis that results is ""'osteoarthritis''.'""The symptoms of Paget's disease depend on the bones affected and the severity of the disease. Enlarged bones can pinch adjacent nerves, causing tingling and numbness. Bowing of the legs can occur. Hip or knee involvement can lead to arthritis, ""'limping'', as well as pain and ''stiffness'' of the hip or knee. ''Headache'', ''loss of vision'', and ''hearing loss'"" can occur when bones of the skull are affected. With very widespread Paget's disease, it is possible to develop ""'congestive heart failure'' due to an increased workload on the ''heart''. Sometimes the skin overlying the involved bone is warmer than usual. This is because of the increased blood supply to pagetic bone.'  "
What specialties of doctors diagnose and treat Paget's disease?,"""Paget's disease is treated by generalists, including general and family medicine doctors and internists, as well as specialists including ""'rheumatologists'', orthopedic surgeons, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians) for ''hearing'"" loss. Frequently, the care of individuals with Paget's disease is a coordinated effort between several health care professionals depending on its location, symptoms, and complications."" "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease?,"""Health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease based on the X-ray appearance. Doctors also may detect Paget's disease with other imaging tests, such as a ""'bone scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and ''CT scan'' to make a diagnosis. ''Alkaline phosphatase'"", an enzyme that comes from bone, is frequently elevated in the blood of people with Paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. This blood test is also referred to as the serum ""'alkaline phosphatase'"" (SAP) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of Paget's disease.""""The bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of Paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. Bone that is affected by Paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images. A bone biopsy is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis of Paget's disease. Bone biopsy would be considered if there was a suspicion of ""'cancer'' or abnormal lesion in the involved bone.' "
What is the medical treatment for Paget's disease?,"""The medical treatment of Paget's disease is directed toward controlling the disease activity and managing its complications. When Paget's disease causes no symptoms and blood testing shows that the level of serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or minimally elevated, no treatment may be necessary. Bone pain can require anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") or pain-relieving medicines. Bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear. Surgery may be necessary for damaged joints, fractures, severely deformed bones, or when nerves are being pinched by enlarged bone. Prior to undergoing surgery on bone affected by Paget's disease, it is helpful for doctors to treat patients with medications, such as bisphosphonates or ""'calcitonin'' (Miacalcin), as this tends to diminish the risk of surgical complications, including bleeding.'""The medical treatment of the bone of Paget's disease involves either medicines called bisphosphonates or injectable calcitonin. Doctors more commonly use these drugs to treat certain patients with ""'osteoporosis'"". Paget's disease is not related to ""'osteoporosis'"", however. Furthermore, the dosing of the medications are different for Paget's disease and ""'osteoporosis''.'""Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment for Paget's disease of bone. There are a number of medicines available that are taken by mouth, including ""'alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), ''etidronate'' (''Didronel''), and ''tiludronate'' (''Skelid''), and that are administered intravenously, including pamidronate (''Aredia'') and zoledronate (''Reclast''). In general, oral bisphosphonates are taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with 8 ounces of water; the medicine can cause irritation of the stomach and ''esophagus'' and are usually avoided in those patients with ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''). Intravenous bisphosphonates can be given to those with ''GERD''. Intravenous bisphosphonates can cause temporary muscle and ''joint pain'' but are not associated with irritation of the stomach or esophagus.'  "
Are there home remedies for Paget's disease?,"""There are no specific home remedies for Paget's disease of bone. Topical pain salves, ""'over-the-counter'' pain relievers, orthopedic support devices, including canes and splints, all can be helpful in certain patients.' "
What are complications of Paget's disease?,"""Complications of Paget's disease include bone pain, fracture of bone, deformity, nerve irritation (impingement), arthritis, localized skin warmth, and rarely, sarcoma, a form of ""'bone cancer''. Sarcoma of bone is also referred to as ''osteosarcoma'"" and is rare (less than 1% of patients with the condition). Abnormalities of calcium and phosphorus balance are common. Bleeding can occur during surgery, when affected bone is operated on, because of an increased blood supply to the bone. When Paget's disease affects the area of the skull adjacent to the nerves of hearing, it can sometimes lead to hearing loss due to pressure on the nerves."" "
What is the prognosis for Paget's disease?,"""The outlook is generally good, particularly if treatment is given before major changes in the affected bones have occurred. Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, and the long bones of the thighs and lower legs. In general, symptoms progress slowly. Paget's disease is not a ""'bone cancer'"", and the disease does not spread to normal bones. Overall health of the patient is usually not affected by Paget's disease. Treatment can control Paget's disease and lessen symptoms, but treatment does not cure Paget's disease. Sarcoma form of bone ""'cancer'', though rare, can seriously affect overall health.' "
Is it possible to prevent Paget's disease?,"""There is no way to prevent Paget's disease of bone."" "
Where can I find more information about Paget's disease?,"""For further information, contact the Paget's Disease Foundation.""""The Paget's Disease Foundation""'120 Wall Street, Suite 1602''New York, NY 10005-4001''Phone: 212-509-5335''Fax: 212-509-8492''[email\xa0protected]' "
What are antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)?,"'Between 95 and 98% of patients with ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' (''PBC'') have autoantibodies (antibodies to self) in their blood that react with the inner lining of mitochondria. These autoantibodies are called antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Mitochondria are the energy factories present inside all of our cells, not just the cells of the ''liver'' or bile ducts. (The mitochondria use the oxygen carried in the blood from the ''lungs'' as a fuel to generate energy.) AMA actually bind to protein antigens that are contained in multienzyme complexes (packages of enzymes) within the inner lining of the mitochondria. These multienzyme complexes produce key chemical reactions necessary for life. The complexes are referred to as multienzyme because they are made up of multiple enzyme units.''AMA specifically react against a component of this multienzyme complex called E2. In PBC, AMA preferentially react with the E2 component of one of the multienzymes that is called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Accordingly, the antigen is designated as PDC-E2. The practical importance of all of this is that the PDC-E2 antigen is now used, as discussed below, in a diagnostic test for PBC. The PDC-E2 antigen is also referred to as M2, a term introduced to designate it as the second mitochondrial antigen discovered by researchers interested in PBC.'  "
Do AMA cause the destruction of the bile ducts in PBC?,"'In as much as the bile ducts are the main targets of destruction in PBC, the question was asked whether the AMA reacts with the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts. So, investigators prepared antibodies to PDC-E2. As expected, they found that these antibodies bound to the mitochondria within the cells. But, sure enough, recent information suggests that these AMA autoantibodies also bind to PDC-E2 that lies outside the mitochondria, yet within the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts.''This accumulation of PDC-E2 within the biliary epithelial cells is observed exclusively in the livers of patients with PBC, and not in normal livers or in livers from patients with any other types of ''liver disease''. Interestingly, it was also observed in the livers of those two to five percent of PBC patients who do not have AMA in their blood (AMA-negative PBC). Furthermore, intense binding of these antibodies to biliary epithelial cells was also found to be the earliest indication of recurrence of PBC in a transplanted liver. (PBC is sometimes treated by liver transplantation.)''Nevertheless, no evidence exists that the AMA itself causes the destruction of the biliary epithelial cells lining the small bile ducts. Neither the presence nor the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood appears to be related to the inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts. Indeed, immunization of animals with PDC-E2 antigen results in production of AMA without any liver or bile duct damage (pathology).' "
How is the blood test for AMA done?,"""The most economical test for AMA applies diluted samples of a patient's serum onto tissue sections from rat stomach or kidney in the laboratory. (Remember that mitochondria are present in virtually all cells, not just the cells of the liver and bile ducts.) Serum antibodies that attach (bind) to mitochondrial membranes within the tissue cells can then be observed with a microscope. The most dilute sample of serum showing this binding reaction is reported, using the term titer. The titer indicates the most dilute serum sample that reacts with the tissue mitochondria. A higher titer means there is a greater amount of AMA in the serum.""'The antigen recognized by AMA in patients with PBC is now known to be PDC-E2 and is also often referred to as the M2 antigen. So, newly developed tests for antibodies that bind to PDC-E2 are more specific and are now available to confirm the diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is the value of the AMA blood test?,"'AMA are detectable in the serum in 95 to 98% of patients with PBC. So, AMA are tremendously important as a diagnostic marker in patients with PBC. The AMA titers in PBC are almost universally greater than or equal to 1 to 40. This means that a serum sample diluted with 40 times its original volume still contains enough antimitochondrial antibodies to be detected in the binding reaction. A positive AMA with a titer of at least 1:40 in an adult with an elevated ''alkaline phosphatase'' in the blood is highly specific for a diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that utilizes a photosensitizing molecule (frequently a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. Very thin superficial ''skin cancers'' called ''actinic keratoses'' and certain other types of ''cancer'' cells can be eliminated this way. ''Acne'"" can also be treated as well. The procedure is easily performed in a physician's office or outpatient setting. PDT is also referred to as blue light therapy.""'PDT essentially has three steps. First, a light-sensitizing liquid, cream, or intravenous drug (photosensitizer) is applied or administered. Occasionally, a photosensitizing molecule that is already part of the body can be activated. Second, there is an incubation period of minutes to days. Finally, the target tissue is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light that then activates the photosensitizing medication. The mechanism by which tissue is destroyed seems to depend on the presence of activated oxygen molecules.''Steps:''Although first used in the early 1900s, PDT in the modern sense is a new, evolving science. Current PDT involves a variety of incubation times for different the light-sensitizing ''drugs'' and a variety of light sources depending on the target tissue. The basic premise of PDT is selective tissue destruction.''At present, the primary limitation of available PDT technology for skin is the depth of penetration of the light and ability to target cells within 1/3 of an inch (approximately 1 cm) of the light source. Therefore, tumors or atypical growths must be close to the surface of the skin for PDT to work.''PDT is currently used in a number of medical fields, including ''oncology'' (''cancer''), dermatology (skin), ''cosmetic surgery'', ophthalmology, and oral medicine.''In oncology, PDT is FDA approved for ''non-small cell lung cancer'', ''esophageal cancer'', and ''precancerous'"" changes of Barrett's ""'esophagus''. Its use is also being further investigated through ''clinical trials'' in general oncology for conditions including ''cancers'' of the cervix (mouth of uterus), ''prostate gland'', brain, and peritoneal ''cavity'' (the abdominal space that contains the stomach, ''liver'', and internal organs).''In dermatology, PDT with the photosensitizer Levulan Kerastick (20% delta-aminolevulinic acid HCl) is used for the treatment of very early, thin skin cancers called actinic keratoses (AK). The initial approval was specifically for the treatment of ''actinic keratosis'' of the face and ''scalp'' with application of the photosensitizer followed by a timed exposure to a special blue light source. PDT has also used for ''acne'', ''rosacea'', thin nonmelanoma skin cancers, sun damage, enlarged sebaceous glands, ''wrinkles'', ''warts'', ''hidradenitis suppurativa'', ''psoriasis'', and many other ''skin conditions''. It is not used to remove ''moles'' or ''birthmarks''. '   application of photosensitizer drug incubation period light activation"
What photosensitizer drugs are available?,"'FDA-approved photosensitizers include porfimer sodium (Photofrin), 5-aminolevulinic acid or ALA (Levulan), and methyl aminolevulinate [MAOP] (Metvix). More drugs may become available in the near future. Photofrin is used intravenously for internal cancers while Levulan and Metvix are applied topically for skin therapy.' "
"What light sources are available, and how are they applied?","'PDT light sources include laser light, intense pulsed light, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), blue light, red light, and many other visible lights (including natural sunlight). Photosensitizer drugs may become activated by one or several types of light. The optimal light source depends on the ideal wavelength for the particular drug used and target tissue.''The light source needs to be directly applied to the target tissue for an appropriate amount of time. For surface skin treatments, the light is directly applied to the area of the skin where the photosensitizer drug has been applied (such as face, scalp, arms, etc.). For internal cancers, delivering the light to the desired area is more challenging. The light may be delivered through small ''fiber''-optic cables into the body ''cavity'' or area being treated. Sometimes, endoscopes (a thin, lighted, elongated tube that is inserted into a body space) are used to deliver the light into the ''lungs'', stomach, or bladder.' "
How does photodynamic therapy work?,"'PDT works by direct injury to the target cells and tissues. This involves the production of an activated oxygen molecule that can injure or destroy nearby cells. Because the normal skin barrier is not present at the sites of the actinic keratoses, photosensitizing molecule is preferentially absorbed there and then activated by light. The activated oxygen destroys the adjacent abnormal tissue. Once the areas have healed following PDT, the areas are reexamined to see if additional treatments or biopsies are needed.''With traditional cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), only the visible actinic keratoses can be treated. Since many actinic keratoses are often not evident, PDT might be preferable since it presumably would destroy these ""subclinical"" lesions. PDT allows for treatment of an entire area of sun damage simultaneously, but subsequent treatments may be necessary.' "
Does PDT make me permanently more sensitive to light?,"'No, PDT causes a temporary ''sensitivity to light'', including natural sunlight and some indoor lights. The light sensitivity resolves with time, depending on both the photosensitizer drug and dosage used.''Light avoidance is generally required after PDT. The duration depends on the drug and dosage used. Intravenous porphyrin may make the body, including the skin and eyes, sensitive to light for about 6 weeks after treatment. Proper protection, including long sleeves and ''sunglasses'', may be required. Topically applied aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate may cause skin sensitivity only on the treatment areas for approximately 24-72 hours. These do not usually cause sensitivity on other body parts other than where the drug was directly applied. Your physician will need to discuss with you the required sun- and light-avoidance period required after your particular treatment.' "
How is PDT used to treat the skin?,"'PDT using Levulan and a proprietary blue light is currently FDA approved for the treatment of early skin precancers called actinic keratoses (rough scaly spots generally on sun-exposed skin). PDT is also known as ""ALA/PDT treatment"" or ""Super Blue Light."" It has been referred to as a ""super photo facial"" when the photosensitizer is used with a machine called intense pulsed light or IPL. These treatments may help remove sun-damaged precancerous skin. Sun damage, fine lines, and blotchy pigmentation may also be improved because of the positive effect of PDT. PDT seems to reduce oil gland function and so is helpful in treating ''acne'' and ''rosacea''.'""Although PDT's use in skin was first investigated in 1990s for ""'actinic keratosis'"", it was not as popular or widely used because of the required long incubation times (usually 18-24 hours) and limited indications. Since approximately 2001, PDT has become more widespread primarily because of advances including shorter incubation times (30-60 minutes). In Europe, studies utilizing the exposure to ambient sunlight after application of the photosensitizer and a chemical sunblock (to prevent exposure to ultraviolet light) seemed to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratoses. This could eliminate the need for treatment to be administered in a physician's office."" "
What is a typical skin PDT session like?,"'You may be given a written procedure consent form to read and sign before your first treatment. The medical staff may take some pretreatment photography prior to applying the photosensitizer medication.''In the treatment room, you may be sitting or comfortably lying back on a table. Often a thorough cleansing of the face is done using ''alcohol'' and or acetone to degrease the skin.''The photosensitizer liquid or cream is applied topically to the whole area being treated (such as the entire face, scalp, back of the hands, back part of the forearms, legs, ''feet'', scalp, chest, or back).''The medication is allowed to air dry for a few minutes, and then you will wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for the incubation time. Some areas such as chest, back, and particularly forearms and legs require longer incubation times of 2 to 18 hours, depending on skin pigmentation and anatomical site. PDT requires physician adjustments for specific individualized incubation times and treatment durations.''After the proper incubation time, you are exposed to the light source. There may be sensations of warmth, tingling, heat, or burning in some patients. A fan can be used to help cool off during the treatment. The treatment area is then washed off and ''sunscreen'' applied. Instructions are given on how to care for the skin at home.' "
"How much improvement can I expect with 
photodynamic therapy?","'No two individuals are the same, and results may vary. Some conditions can improve dramatically in some patients and not respond in others.''Overall, patients with severely ''sun-damaged skin'' with actinic ''keratosis'', mottled pigmentation, dull or sallow skin, and skin laxity, may see good to excellent improvement with PDT. There can be improvement of large pores, non-pitted ''acne'' ''scars'', and active acne.''Depending on the area being treated and the recommended incubation time, different numbers of treatment sessions spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart may be required to achieve the desired improvement and reduction in lesions. On average, a series of two to three treatments are performed. It is not always possible to predict ahead of time how many treatments your specific condition may take or how you will respond to PDT.''After photodynamic sun avoidance for 24-48 hours is necessary.' "
"Where can I have photodynamic therapy, and who performs the procedure?","""Photodynamic therapy for skin disease is usually comfortably performed in an outpatient setting like a doctor's office and without any sedation or anesthesia. You may check the ""'www.AAD.org'' for board-certified dermatologist members of the American Board of Dermatology in your area. Additionally, oncologists and other physicians may be trained in this area.''Most skin PDT is performed only by specially trained dermatologists and their medical staff. Other physicians, including oncologists, family physicians, internal medicine doctors, ''plastic'' surgeons, or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons and their medical staff who are trained, may also perform photodynamic therapy.' "
What are the advantages with photodynamic therapy for treating actinic keratoses?,"'The greatest advantage of PDT is the ability to selectively treat an entire area of skin damage and precancerous actinic keratoses (blanket or field treatment). PDT generally decreases the likelihood of lighter or darker skin spots (post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation) caused by routine freezing with liquid nitrogen. Additionally, PDT frequently may facilitate smoother skin and an overall improved appearance, tone, color, and enhanced skin texture.''In several studies, PDT has been preferred by many patients for ease of use and rapid recovery as compared to alternative treatments including freezing and topical fluorouracil (''Efudex''). The PDT side effects may be milder with less downtime than with fluorouracil.''For patients with many skin lesions, PDT may be generally more effective than repeated spot treatment with topical liquid nitrogen. Some patients are unable to tolerate the prolonged treatment required with fluorouracil or imiquimod (''Aldara'') because of the irritation, redness, and possible downtime with these topical creams. PDT is very well-tolerated, noninvasive (no needles or surgery required) procedure to help reduce sun damage and enhance the overall cosmetic outcome (particularly in sensitive areas of the face and chest).' "
Am I a good candidate for photodynamic therapy?,"'The best candidates for PDT may be those with lighter or fair skin with sun damage.''You may not be a good candidate for photodynamic therapy if you have darker skin that tends to turn brown or discolor with certain light or laser treatments. You may also not be a good candidate for PDT if you are very sensitive to light, ''burn'' extremely easily, would be unable to stay out of sunlight for the required 24-48 hours, or are taking medications which may make you very sensitive to sunlight or light-based therapies. People with certain medical diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'') may not be candidates for PDT because of increased risk of burning from the light exposure.''Your decision on the best treatment choice may depend on different factors such as the location and type of skin lesions, your past treatments, your overall health, and level of comfort. Your physician can help you sort through the different treatments.''Your physician needs to know of any other medical conditions that may affect your procedure or overall ''wound'' healing. You would want to make sure to tell your physician beforehand if you have any extreme sensitivity to light-based treatments, take medications which make you very sensitive to light, have had a problem or bad effect from prior PDT, have ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', or suffer from a condition called ''porphyria''. During the exposure to light, there is a moderately uncomfortable burning sensation that most patients seem to tolerate without additional ''pain'' medication.''Your PDT physician needs to know if you have had a history of ''staph'' or other skin infections in the recent past. You will also want to advise your physician if you have a history of frequent ''cold sores'' (''herpes'' virus infections on your face). In that case, you may be prescribed an antiviral tablet (''cold''-sore ''prevention'' pill) to take before and after your procedure. You may be asked to wash with a special antibiotic soap or wash.''Patients may need to also advise their physician of any drug ''allergies'' such as to topical anesthetics or other photosensitizers. Additionally, the surgeon may need to know of any bleeding or ''bruising'' tendencies, ''hepatitis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', or ''pregnancy''.''Your physician will want to know of any factors that may affect your surgery or wound healing.'  "
What growths is PDT not good for?,'PDT is not as effective for thick actinic keratoses due to the inability of the photosensitizer drug to penetrate into the depths of the lesion. These growths may need to be destroyed using some other technique.' 
What are possible complications or side effects of photodynamic therapy?,"'Overall, most patients tolerate the minor procedure very well without any complications. However, PDT is associated with some possible minor risks and complications. Since an exaggerated light-sensitive reaction is expected by definition of PDT, most patients understand and expect some type of a ''sunburn'' or red reaction after skin PDT. Not everyone gets a ''sunburn'' reaction, however. Some patients may have no visible reaction or redness.''Possible risks and complications of photodynamic therapy include burning of the treated area, skin discoloration, skin redness, prominent tiny blood vessels (telangiectasia), ''pain'', infection, cold-sore activation, ''blisters'', scabs, unsightly scars, cosmetic disfigurement, skin discoloration, eye injury or swelling, ''allergic'' reactions, prolonged sun sensitivity, and reaction to topical anesthesia.''Minor, serious, or life-threatening reactions can occur with the use of anesthetics or with medications given before, after, or during a procedure.' "
Is there scarring from photodynamic therapy?,"'No, PDT usually does not leave scars in typical cases. Overall when you undergo PDT, there will be some type of a red skin reaction and irritation for 3 to 10 days after the treatment. Some people are more sensitive to PDT and the light treatment than others. Similarly, some people heal better or faster than others. Some residual redness may be more noticeable depending on the location and skin type. Some people may have temporary skin discoloration that may last weeks to months. Patients with darker skin types may have more skin discoloration after treatment.' "
What are alternatives for photodynamic therapy?,"'It is important to understand that as with any medical treatment, there are alternative treatments to PDT. You may want to discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor at your consultation appointment.''There are many options for treatment of an actinic keratosis (AK), including but not limited to freezing (''cryotherapy'' or cryosurgery), burning, chemical peels, creams (like fluorouracil and immune modulator creams like imiquimod), local destruction by curettage and desiccation (scrape and ''burn''), and other choices depending on the skin condition.''In acne, there are many alternatives to PDT, including oral ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane), oral antibiotics, topical washes, acne facials, and many acne creams.' "
What about insurance coverage and costs of photodynamic therapy?,"""Photodynamic therapy is currently considered a medical service for the treatment of some conditions, particularly for actinic keratosis. However, it may be considered cosmetic, off' label, or not medically indicated for conditions for which it is regularly used.""'Currently, some insurance plans cover the procedure under their provided benefits. However, with the many changes in insurance plans, it is always advisable to contact your insurance carrier prior to scheduling any treatment and confirm your eligibility and benefits.''Photodynamic therapy, like any procedure, will result in additional procedure charges above the routine office-visit fees. These fees may range from two to several hundred dollars depending on the area, number of treatments, and the type of insurance you purchase. The greater number of treatments and greater the amount of photosensitizer medication required, the higher the cost.''Insurance benefits vary, and reimbursement depends on what benefits you have contracted for with your insurance company. Currently, Medicare generally typically covers 80% of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses. If you have a secondary insurance plan, that may help cover the remaining 20% not covered by Medicare.''Standard commercial or non-Medicare insurances currently generally may cover a large percentage of PDT for actinic kurtosis unless you have to meet an out-of-pocket deductible first. You may want to get to know and understand your insurance benefits before having surgery. In many cases, you may also ask the billing office at the medical center or your insurance coordinator for an approximate estimate of your charges before scheduling the procedure.' "
How do I prepare for my procedure?,"'Your personal physician and their medical personnel will likely let you know the preoperative instructions specific for your condition.'""For many typical PDT procedures in a physician's office, most patients are advised to come in with a clean, washed area without any lotions or ""'makeup''. You may generally eat your regular ''diet'' on the day of their procedure and take all of your regular daily medications. Your skin should be fully clean and free of all makeup, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Bring a wide-brimmed hat (6 inches), sunglasses, and scarf when appropriate to the appointment. Patients are advised to wear comfortable casual clothes and bring a wide-brimmed hat for facial or scalp treatments. You should bring gloves or a long-sleeve shirt if having hands or forearms treated.''In nearly all cases, patients are usually able to drive after most procedures and do not necessarily need a driver unless they feel uncomfortable or have taken any sedative medications.''Since you will be in the office for generally at least one hour, you may want to bring some personal snacks, ''drinks'', and reading or knitting material. Personal music headsets may also provide relaxation and help pass time during your PDT application, incubation time, and treatment.''Most patients continue all prescribed medications, including ''aspirin'' and any blood thinners unless specifically advised otherwise only by the doctor.''While there is no absolute contraindication, ''smoking'' is discouraged for at least a few days before and 1 to 2 weeks after your procedure. As with any procedure, ''smoking'' can slow down wound healing and cause an increased risk of wound infections.''Heavy alcohol use is not advised at least a few days before PDT. Heavy alcohol use can cause more bleeding and thin your blood. An occasional glass of wine or small cocktail may not cause severe bleeding.' "
How is recovery after photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Recovery is usually fairly easy and uneventful. Many patients have mild dryness and a faint to mild sunburn of the treated area. A small percent of patients may have moderate or marked discomfort and a harder recovery because of more skin dryness, redness, or burning.''Some of these patients have had inadvertent sun exposure even as short as a minute or two during their immediate post-treatment time, causing a more severe reaction.''You will want to plan to stay indoors and avoid any sunlight for 24-48 hours as directed by your physician. Overall, you may be able to resume all normal indoor activities the first day.''Most patients are able to their normal activities 24-48 hours after photodynamic therapy. Avoiding direct sunlight for the first 1 to 2 days in crucial to avoiding getting an exuberant (red) response. Your physician will need to let you know what activity precautions are required based on the area and size of your procedure.' "
Is there pain after PDT?,"'Typically, there is little pain with PDT. No two individuals are exactly the same, and individual reactions and tolerance to discomfort levels vary. Most patients report mild skin irritation including minimal to mild dryness and tight feeling of their skin after PDT. This discomfort is usually improved with frequent application of bland topical emollients or plain Vaseline.'""A small number of patients may actually complain that they felt nothing and didn't have any pain or peeling. Less commonly, a small percentage of patients for various reasons may have significant pain, a very exaggerated sunburn response, moderate overall discomfort, and pain from the tightness and warmth of the skin.""'If there is pain, many patients find that they prefer to take something for pain at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the pain builds up to an unbearable level. If you have mild or moderate pain, your doctor may advise you to take ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or another ''pain reliever''. Rarely, prescription pain medications may be required for severe pain.''Your physician will let you know what pain medications are recommended for your specific condition.' "
How do I take care of my treatment area after photodynamic therapy?,"'It is generally required to check with your doctor for their specific ''wound care'' instructions before your procedure. Often, you will be asked to go home and stay indoors for the rest of the day. Your physician will usually give you more detailed instructions depending on the area and size of the procedure.''Many physicians suggest you shower and wash the area immediately and as often as you would like. Wound care may require gently washing the area with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide two to three times a day and applying an ''over-the-counter'' antibiotic ointment or a nonirritating moisturizer like Purpose, Cetaphil, or Aquaphor to the area. Avoidance of harsh or abrasive cleansers is advised. Picking or scrubbing the skin could cause in severe irritation or scarring.''Most patients are advised to try to avoid applying makeup or powder directly on a fresh or ''open wound'"" unless the surface is fully healed. A nonirritating sunscreen such as zinc or titanium may be applied immediately after the procedure before leaving the physician's office. Sunscreens are ideally also applied twice a day after PDT. It is important to follow your own physician's instructions for wound care.""'Mild to moderate redness and or swelling is not uncommon the first day or two after PDT and can be lessened by application of an ice bag, ice cubes, or ice chips in a small Ziploc bag, or frozen peas in their bag. Applying cool packs or ice every 5 to 15 minutes every hour for the first 8 to 24 hours after your procedure may be very soothing. Swelling may be more common for procedures around the eyes or lips. Sleeping propped up on a few pillows or in a reclining chair may help decrease swelling after treatment of the head and face area.'""Your physician should be notified of any infections, cold-sore outbreaks, extreme swelling, or other unexpected reactions. Rarely, a visit to the physician's office may be necessary for severe swelling or infection. Oral antibiotics, cortisone creams or tablets, or other medications may be required for adverse reactions.""'Your physician will need to know if pain is increasing after one to two days after your procedure or if you are having ''fever'"" or other concerning symptoms. In such cases, you may need to be seen at the physician's office."" "
"What is the chance that my actinic 
keratoses will recur?","'While PDT is a very effective treatment, there is a reasonable chance that you may continue to need periodic treatments for actinic keratoses, depending on your individual skin, severity of prior sun damage, and your compulsion to avoid the sun.''Actinic keratoses may recur or a new ''cancer'' may develop in the same or adjacent area even after photodynamic therapy or other treatments. Some skin actinic keratoses are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up.''Sun-damaged skin frequently needs follow-up and possible further treatment. Several studies have shown that photodynamic therapy tends to have a cure rate comparable to the traditional treatment with fluorouracil (''Carac'', Efudex, and ''Fluoroplex'').''It is important to note that PDT is not curative in invasive ''skin cancer''. This may require one or more procedures such as biopsy, surgery, ''radiation'', or other procedures to fully treat those lesions.''Follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or physician are very important, especially in the first few years after photodynamic therapy. Many patients are seen every 4 to 6 months after their diagnosis of actinic keratoses of the skin.''Self-skin examinations monthly are good practice for patients with a history of ''skin cancer''. Any changing or new growth should be promptly checked by your physician. More regular follow-up appointments may be needed for those with more aggressive tumors or tumors in high-risk areas. Your physician will recommend the proper follow-up for your specific condition.' "
Facts you should know about peanut allergy," The prevalence of peanut allergy in the United States is approximately 0.6%-1.3%. The rate of peanut allergy is higher in individuals with additional allergic conditions or a family history of allergic conditions, including a sibling with a peanut allergy. One-third of patients with peanut allergy are also allergic to tree nuts. About 90% of reactions to peanut occur within 20 minutes of exposure. Peanut allergy with asthma is a risk factor for a severe allergic reaction. Peanut allergy symptoms and signs includeskin redness,itching,rash (hives). skin redness, itching, rash (hives). More severe symptoms and signs include:wheezing,dyspnea,cough,nausea and vomiting,diarrhea,low blood pressure,increased heart rate,dizziness,fainting,behavioral changes (particularly in children). wheezing, dyspnea, cough, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, dizziness, fainting, behavioral changes (particularly in children). Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for a systemic allergic reaction to peanut. Roughly 20% of children outgrow peanut allergy by their school-age years. There is no cure for peanut allergy."
What is a peanut allergy?,"""Peanut allergy develops when the body's immune system has an abnormal, hypersensitivity response to one or more of the peanut proteins. Peanut allergy is one of the most common ""'food allergies'' in both children and adults. It receives particular attention because it is relatively common, typically lifelong, and can cause severe allergic reactions. Peanut allergy is the leading cause of ''anaphylaxis'' and death due to ''food allergy''. It can lead to significant burden on patients and their families. Peanut is a common food ingredient making strict avoidance difficult. Therefore, there is a relatively high rate of accidental peanut ingestions for those trying to avoid peanuts. For all of the above reasons, peanut allergy has become an important public-health issue.' "
How common is a peanut allergy?,"'This prevalence of peanut allergy has increased significantly over the past decade, most notably in westernized countries. The prevalence of peanut allergy in westernized countries is approximately 0.5%, with the greatest prevalence in children under 3 years of age. This increase in prevalence has also occurred with other allergic conditions, such as ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis''), ''asthma'', and ''hay fever'' (''allergic rhinitis''). Peanut allergy is much less common in underdeveloped areas of the world, such as Africa and Asia. Emerging literature suggests that the increasing rate of peanut allergy may be leveling off in many nations, including the United States.' "
What causes a peanut allergy?,"'Risk factors for peanut allergy include a personal or family history of allergic conditions, such as''A sibling of a child with peanut allergy has approximately a 7% chance of developing peanut allergy, as compared to the baseline population risk of 0.5%. Other factors influencing peanut allergy include exposure during ''pregnancy'' and lactation, exposure to peanut protein through household dust, and exposure to skin-care products containing crude peanut oil.'""There has been significant recent research on the timing of peanut exposure into a child's ""'diet'' and its effect on the risk of allergy. In the early 2000s, recommendations were to delay the introduction of peanuts until 3 years of age. The rates of peanut allergy more than doubled in countries following these recommendations. It was also observed that rates of peanut allergy were significantly lower in countries, such as Israel, where children were introduced to peanuts at a younger age.''In 2008, the recommendation regarding delayed introduction of peanut was retracted, and research began to indicate that earlier introduction of peanut may be protective against ''food allergy'"". In a landmark study publish in 2015 (LEAP study), it was shown that early introduction of peanut into a child's ""'diet'"", at 4 months of age, significantly decreased the risk of developing peanut allergy in a high-risk population. This study, along with additional research, may very well lead to updated guidelines on the timing of introduction of peanuts and other highly allergenic foods into a child's diet.""'It is not clear why the rate of peanut allergy is increasing in the United States and other westernized nations. This is an area of active medical research.'   asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and particularly eczema (atopic dermatitis)."
What are peanut allergy symptoms and signs? How do doctors diagnose a peanut allergy?,"'The most important step in the diagnosis of peanut allergy is a detailed history. A good history may essentially make the diagnosis of a peanut allergy. Important factors for a suggestive history of peanut allergy include the following:''Timing of symptoms'': The majority of reactions occur within 20 minutes, with nearly all reactions occurring within two hours of exposure to peanuts.''Types of peanut allergy symptoms'': About 80% to 90% of reactions involve skin manifestations such as''Nevertheless, reactions can occur in the absence of a rash, and these reactions may be the most severe. Other common signs and symptoms involve the''Consistency'': Reactions should consistently occur with every peanut exposure.''Following the history, the skin prick test (SPT) is generally the test of choice in making a diagnosis of peanut allergy. It is very important to be aware that a positive SPT alone does not make the diagnosis of peanut allergy. Of note, many individuals with a positive SPT to peanut will not be peanut allergic. The usefulness of a peanut SPT increases as the size of the reaction increases. Sometimes, SPT results are inconclusive and may be followed up with a blood test known as peanut specific IgE levels.''Similar to the SPT, peanut-specific IgE levels must be interpreted based upon the clinical history. Undetectable peanut-specific IgE levels do not rule out the possibility of peanut allergy, with reaction rates of up to 20% being reported in individuals with undetectable peanut-specific IgE. Much like SPT, the likelihood of true peanut allergy increases with increasing levels of peanut-specific IgE.'""Despite a thorough clinical history, SPT, and peanut-specific IgE levels, the diagnosis of peanut allergy may still remain in question. In these instances, a physician-supervised oral food challenge (OFC) may be indicated. In an OFC, patients are given gradually increasing amounts of peanut, usually in an allergist's office, and closely monitored for allergic symptoms. OFCs have not only been shown to significantly improve quality of life regardless of whether the challenge is passed or failed, but they have also been shown to be very safe when performed in an appropriate setting under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of food allergy. During the diagnostic process of peanut allergy, it is also important to determine if peanut-allergic individuals are allergic to tree nuts, since up to one-third of patients with peanut allergy will also react to tree nuts.""   a rash, including hives, redness, itching. respiratory system (difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing), gastrointestinal system (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), cardiovascular system (increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure), neurological system (lightheadedness, passing out), even changes in behavior, especially in children."
How are peanut allergies managed? What is the treatment for a peanut allergy?,"'Strict avoidance of peanuts and prompt treatment of accidental ingestions are the mainstays of management of peanut allergy. The goals of treatment are to minimize the risk of accidental ingestion while maintaining adequate ''nutrition'' and an acceptable quality of life.''Although there is significant research focused on oral immunotherapy and desensitization protocols for peanut allergy, these treatment options are still not ready for widespread clinical use. There is also significant research involving a peanut patch, also known as epi-cutaneous immunotherapy.''Early studies of this patch have shown that by applying a patch containing peanut protein to the skin, it may be possible to make peanut allergic individuals less sensitive to peanut protein and it may protect certain peanut-allergic individuals from experiencing a reaction to an accidental peanut exposure. There are still many questions regarding this possible form of therapy and it is still not ready for widespread clinical use.''Peanut is a common food in the Unites States, and strict avoidance requires constant awareness of food labels and food ingredients. United States legislation requires all food companies to identify on labels whether their products contain the most common food allergens, including peanuts.''Advisory labeling practices, such as those stating ""may contain peanut,"" ""manufactured on shared equipment with peanut,"" or ""manufactured in the same facility as peanut,"" are not regulated. The potential risk of ingesting peanut from foods labeled with advisory labeling is unknown, so peanut-allergic individuals should also avoid these foods.''Despite attempts at strict avoidance, accidental ingestions occur in up to 15% of patients per year, as evidenced by a British study. All individuals with a peanut allergy should have an emergency action plan outlining the treatment plan for an acute reaction. Since ''epinephrine injection'' is the only treatment for a significant allergic reaction, all individuals with a peanut allergy should carry an ''epinephrine auto-injector'' (''Auvi-Q'', ''Epipen'', ''Twinject'') at all times.''Although ''antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may also be used in the management of acute allergic reactions, epinephrine generally remains the treatment of choice. Individuals who experience an acute allergic reaction to an accidental peanut exposure should also notify a health care professional. It is very important to note that the severity of acute reactions is variable and cannot be predicted by diagnostic testing or previous reactions. Risk factors for poor outcomes from peanut allergy include asthma and delayed treatment with epinephrine.''There are important additional considerations in managing and counseling individuals with peanut allergy. Research has shown that reactions due to skin contact are typically limited to the site of contact and unlikely to cause a systemic reaction or anaphylaxis. Similarly, the vast majority of peanut-allergic individuals will tolerate being around peanuts and the smell of peanut, since peanut protein is not airborne.''The majority of peanut-allergic individuals will also tolerate peanut oil, since the peanut protein is not present in the highly purified oils, except in the rarer ''cold''-pressed oils. Although peanut is a legume, most peanut-allergic individuals will also tolerate other legumes, such as ''soy'"", peas, and green beans. Exposure to peanut through another person's saliva (such as from kissing) has been shown to trigger a reaction. All peanut-allergic individuals should discuss these considerations and other questions with their health care provider."" "
Is there a peanut allergy cure?,"'Unfortunately, there is no cure for peanut allergy. Although the natural history of peanut allergy is often difficult to predict, peanut allergy can be outgrown. Approximately 20% of children with peanut allergy will tolerate peanuts by their school-age years. Favorable factors to outgrow peanut allergy include smaller SPT at the time of diagnosis, lower specific IgE levels at the time of diagnosis, milder initial reaction to peanuts, and minimal additional allergic conditions, including a lack of additional ''food allergies'' (particularly tree nuts). If there is a significant likelihood that a child has outgrown peanut allergy, a physician-supervised oral food challenge can be pursued.' "
What is epilepsy?,"'An epileptic ''seizure'' is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of an abnormal activity of the brain. Epileptic ''seizures'' are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute ''trauma'' to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In other words, epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures. '  "
What are the different types of clinical seizures?,"'There are different ''types of seizures'', which traditionally have been categorized as either generalized seizures or partial seizures. Generalized seizures are those in which the clinical manifestations indicate that the whole brain is involved from the beginning of the seizure. Partial seizures (local, focal) are those in which the epileptic event is limited to one part of the body or to a particular function of the brain, indicating that the epileptic seizure started in one limited area of the brain. Partial seizures may remain focal or may expand to the rest of the brain. When seizures expand to the rest of the brain these are referred to as secondary generalized seizures. Consciousness is always impaired in generalized seizures; however, in the case of partial seizures consciousness may be preserved , as in the so-called simple partial seizures, or it may be impaired, as is the case with the complex partial seizures.''Among the generalized seizures, the ''generalized tonic clonic seizure'' (traditionally recognized as a ''grand mal'' seizure) is the most common type. In this seizure there is a succession of muscle contractions (tonic component), more obvious in the extremities but affecting almost every muscle of the body, followed by sudden relaxation (clonic component) and further followed by another tonic component. This succession of events is repeated several times.''Simultaneously, there are other signs and symptoms including dilatation of the pupils, increased ''heart'' rate, and increased ''blood pressure''. ''Cyanosis'' (skin and lips ''turning blue''-purple) is also seen due to persistent contraction of the ''diaphragm'' muscle and holding of the breath. These convulsions are usually followed by a period of ''confusion''. In most instances these seizures, as well as most of the epileptic seizures, last for a few seconds or at the most for 2-3 minutes. Occasionally the seizure event may be prolonged, lasting several minutes. By definition, when the event lasts more than 30 minutes, it is described as status epilepticus.''Another type of generalized seizure is the '' ''absence seizure'', also called petit mal seizure, because the clinical symptoms are not as dramatic as with the generalized tonic clonic seizures. In the absence seizures, as the name implies, the patient looks absent, like ""not being here."" With this type of seizure there is a sudden interruption of activities, and the patient becomes unresponsive. Usually these seizures, particularly when they last longer than a few seconds, are associated with other subtle clinical signs such as eye blinking or twitching in the face or upper body. There is almost no confusion after these seizures, and the patient returns to his/her activities without even acknowledging that a seizure has occurred.''In the ''atonic seizures'' (drop attacks) there is a sudden loss of muscle activity, like a sudden ''paralysis''. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. If these seizures happen when the individual is ''walking'', a fall will result, or if the patient is seated, he/she will experience a sudden drop of the head, usually without the motor reflexes that help people to prevent injuries. These seizures are very brief and might result in serious injuries, most often to the forehead, mouth, and/or face.''The ''myoclonic seizures'' consist of rapid, jerky contractions of isolated muscles or group of muscles which may or may not result in body movements.''The ''tonic seizures'' consist of a brief stiffening of the muscle groups, resulting most often in extension of the arms or legs or arching of the trunk. Some of these seizures might be associated with a forced ''exhalation'' of air, due to a sudden contraction of the expiratory muscle through partially contracted vocal cords, resulting in a loud sound.''With partial (focal, local) seizures, the clinical events originate in a limited area of the brain. The clinical manifestations depend upon the area of the brain that is abnormal. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure.''For example, with simple partial seizures (consciousness is not impaired) if the focal area of the brain involved is the motor area, the patient might have rhythmic contractions in one arm or leg. If the areas compromised are more involved with the visual system then the patient might complain of visual illusions.''Other abnormal sensations might be the result of lesions in the auditory, olfactory, or gustatory areas. Some other symptoms might include:''These patients are conscious when the symptoms occur, and their description of the symptoms can be very useful in determining which area of the brain is involved in the seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery.''The complex partial seizures (sometimes called ""temporal lobe seizures"" or ""psychomotor seizures""), in which consciousness is impaired, have a greater range of symptoms. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language.' epigastric pain, sweating, pallor (paleness), flushing, pupillary dilatation, a sense of ""déjá vu,"" fear or anger."
What causes epilepsy in children?,"'Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy.''For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of ''brain damage'' that occurred after birth.''The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. Alternatively, congenital epilepsy may be the result of factors that interfere with the development of the brain during gestation, resulting in brain malformations.''In acquired epileptic disorders, the damage might occur at the time of birth, for example the case of newborns that have oxygen deprivation during ''labor and delivery''; or intracranial bleeding, as seen in some children born prematurely. Also, the brain damage may occur any time after birth. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, ''encephalitis''), head injuries with brain damage, ''brain tumors'', or intracranial bleeding.' "
Are seizures bad for children?,"'Presently there is no indication that short-lasting seizures will result in any brain damage. However, prolonged seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in some cases could result in brain damage, but this is very unusual. ''Although brain damage is not likely, children can be injured at the time of the seizures. For example, in the atonic seizures there is a sudden loss of muscle power and, if this happens when the patient is standing, it is followed by a fall that might result in injuries to the face and/or mouth. Similar types of physical injuries can happen with other seizures.' "
How is epilepsy treated?,"'The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic ''drugs'', which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. There are several antiepileptic medications. Since certain medications are much better for some seizures, the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral.''When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures.' "
Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'Surgery is indicated in a small group of children.''It usually takes the failure of two or three antiepileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. In general, this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. The failure might be due:'""Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. There is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. This plasticity is higher in younger than in older children."" to a resistance to the antiepileptic medications that are available, to the presence of intolerable side effects to the antiepileptic medication, or a combination of both."
What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. Many tests are used to make this determination.''Electroencephalograms (''EEG'') are very important in determining the type of epileptic seizures as well as the area of the brain that is responsible for the seizure disorder. When the routine EEG (usually one hour long) does not give enough information, the child might need to be hospitalized (usually in special EEG wards) for a prolonged EEG with video monitoring. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. ''Neuroimaging studies are very important to help determine the presence of ''brain lesions''. A ''CT scan'' and an ''MRI'', in some cases, might be helpful to point to the specific area of the brain that is abnormal. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, ''brain tumors'', ''scars'' due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of ''vascular malformations'' that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. ''In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised.''In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. In these children, electrodes that record the brain activity are placed either inside the brain (intracerebral electrodes) or directly on top of the brain (subdural electrodes). This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. ''Resective surgery (removing specific areas of brain tissue) may result in functional deficits. The functional deficits relate to the area of the brain involved in the surgery. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. Of particular importance is the surgery that is performed in or near the temporal lobe which, among other functions, is responsible for language comprehension and memory. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits.''Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. ''It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. ' "
Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery?,"'The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. Most of these teams are in large academic medical centers with affiliations to medical schools. The team will tailor the surgery for each child on an individual basis.' "
What are the types of epilepsy surgery?,"'The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). ' In resective surgery the part of the brain that causes the seizures is removed.  In corpus callosotomy   the major connection between the two sides of the brain is severed (cut). Vagus nerve stimulation is a procedure in which a small wire is attached to the vagus nerve in the neck. This wire is used to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve. "
Resective epilepsy surgery,"""Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. In some children the epileptic area is restricted to one discrete area of the brain, for example the temporal lobe; in other children several areas of the brain might be involved. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. When the lesion is very discrete, a small area of the brain might be removed, a procedure known as partial lobectomy. If the lesion is more extensive, the child might need a bigger resection, known as multilobar resection. In some extreme cases a full half of the brain might need to be removed, known as a hemispherectomy.""'Since resective surgery will result in the elimination of an area of the brain that might still be functioning before the operation is performed, it must be determined that the area in question can be removed without unacceptable problems, such as a loss of language capacity or a severe motor (movement) insufficiency.''In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Fifty percent of children with extensive malformations involving one hemisphere may be seizure-free after hemispherectomy. ''In general, for the selective group of children with well-localized lesions, resective surgery will be beneficial in most of them. ' "
Corpus callosotomy,"'The corpus callosum is a structure composed of nerve fibers that allows for communication between both sides of the brain. Corpus callosotomy consist of cutting the corpus callosum. In partial callosotomy, one section of the corpus callosum is cut, whereas in total callosotomy the whole length of the corpus callosum is cut. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. This is precisely the goal of the callosotomy. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other.''The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed.' "
Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS),"'The vagus nerve is a nerve that connects the brain with several internal organs such as the ''lungs'', heart, stomach, and other organs. Stimulation of the vagus nerve sends information to the brain. Studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve results in an inhibition of seizure activity. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear.''The vagus nerve stimulator (''VNS'') is a device that consists of a wire attached to an electrical stimulator. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. The stimulator is programmed to send electrical signals continuously. The strength and the frequency of the electrical stimulation is adjusted as needed by professionals with special training in this technique. Additionally, the system has a magnetic hand-held device that can be used by the patient. Patients who can recognize the beginning of their seizures, for example those who have auras, can use this device to activate the system and abort the seizure. Also, since the stimulator can be activated at any time, if needed, it could be useful to shorten long-lasting seizures and also in the ''prevention'' of status epilepticus.''VNS seems to be effective in a variety of ''seizure disorders'' and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. Studies show that in many individuals with refractory seizures, VNS significantly reduced seizure activity, and some people have been rendered seizure-free.''VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery.''In the USA, VNS is approved for children older than 12 years of age; however, there is no age limit in the European Union. ''Potential side effects of VNS implantation are those from general anesthesia, the failure of the implant to work and infection at the implant site. Additionally, stimulation of the vagus nerve may cause ''hoarseness'', ''coughing'', and may even change the heart rate. Because the VNS is implanted outside the skull, there is little possibility of additional neurological damage.' "
What are the risks of epilepsy surgery?,"'Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. Some of the tests performed require the use of contrast material that might result in severe ''allergic'' reactions. Implanting electrodes in the brain or placing electrodes on the surface of the brain for continuous monitoring requires surgical procedures that are not very complicated but may be associated with bleeding or infections.''Many tests, as well as the different surgical procedures, require the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. ''There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. Bleeding inside the brain might result in additional brain damage, besides; the accumulation of blood might increase the pressure inside the cranium resulting in severe complications, including death. Also the operation may be complicated by infections that can result in meningitis. A later complication of these events could be the development of ''hydrocephalus'', which may require another surgical procedure.''As described before, resective surgery implies the removal of a piece of the brain that in some instances could be as much as the whole hemisphere. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. ''The range of complications varies with the extent of the surgery and the area removed. For example:''In the particular case of the callosotomy, since there is some degree of disconnection between the right and the left side of the brain, besides the complications already mentioned, some annoying subtle deficiencies may be experienced. For example, some patients may be able to identify, by visual recognition, objects presented to one side of the brain, but might not be able to name them because the memory of the name is in the other side of the brain. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery.''Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. Depending upon the type of pre-existing lesion, the failure rate may be as high as 50%. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery.''In general there are very few complications observed after surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Mortality (death) is very rare.''As previously mentioned, there is plasticity in the brain of young children, mostly up to the age of 7 to 9 years. The plasticity helps in the recovery of deficits that can be the result of surgery. For example, for children in whom the language areas were affected by the surgery there is remarkable recovery of language functions. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. ''Previous contributing medical author: Harley I. Kornblum, MD, PhD'  operations near the motor areas might result in paralysis or weakness in the arms or legs, or loss of fine motor coordination in the hands;  operations near the language areas might result in language disorders;  operations near the cortical visual areas might result in visual deficits."
What is pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?,"'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), also called extracorporeal life support (ECLS), is a technique of providing prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to patients whose ''heart'' and ''lungs'' are unable to provide an adequate amount of ''gas'' exchange or perfusion to sustain life. The technology provides cardiac (heart) and pulmonary (lungs) bypass support outside the patient’s body by evading the damaged heart and lungs. ECMO provides short-term life support and arrests the patient’s own circulation. ECMO functions as an artificial cardiopulmonary system.''An ECMO system works by drawing blood from the patient’s body to artificially oxygenate the ''red blood cells'' in the blood and removes carbon dioxide from the blood. It is usually used in patients after ''cardiopulmonary bypass'', in the late-stage treatment of a patient with profound heart and/or lung failure or ''cardiac arrest'' (''heart attack''). ECMO is also beneficial in providing life support to patients with severe acute viral ''pneumonia'' with serious complications, for example, in ''COVID-19'' (novel Coronavirus disease) cases, where artificial ventilation is insufficient to sustain blood oxygenation levels.''Pediatric ECMO is a treatment system that functions in the same way as a regular ECMO does. The system uses a pump to circulate blood out of the body to oxygenate the blood, remove carbon dioxide, and pump it back into the blood vessels of a very sick child or baby. It can help provide support to a child (or adult) who is awaiting a heart or lung transplant.' "
What is the difference between extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass?,'The differences between extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary bypass include the following:' ECMO can be performed under local anesthesia. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass is usually performed under general anesthesia. ECMO is used for long-term support ranging from 3 to 10 days. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass is used for short-term support usually for a few hours. The purpose of ECMO is to allow time for recovery of the lungs and heart. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass provides support during various types of cardiac surgical procedures.
When is pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation done?,"'Pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in infants who are sick because of ''breathing'' or have heart problems. The purpose of ECMO is to provide enough oxygen to the baby while allowing time for the lungs and heart to rest or heal.''The most common conditions that may require pediatric ECMO in ''babies'' and children are as follows:''After heart surgery, during the recovery period' Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH): In this condition, the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen) fails to develop properly during development. Hence, abdominal contents move into the chest, affecting the development of the lungs. Birth defects of the heart Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS): During the process of labor or delivery, the baby may pass stools (meconium) in the uterus into the amniotic fluid. The meconium mixes with the amniotic fluid, and the baby may inhale the mixture. This can then lead to decreased oxygenation, severe breathing problems, and even death. Severe pneumonia (infection of the lungs) Severe air leaks Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPHN): It is severe high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs Respiratory distress syndrome: It is a collection of fluid in the lungs leading to decreased oxygenation in the body. Sepsis (widespread infection in the body) Asphyxiation (decreased oxygenation due to choking, trauma, drowning, inhalation of toxic gases or electric shock) Pediatric ECMO can act as a bridge to recovery in temporary cardiomyopathy (dilation of the heart) secondary to renal failure, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and severe burns."
Who is an ideal candidate for pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?,"'Selection criteria for neonates include the following:''Failure to meet the criteria is a relative contradiction. It depends on the extent of the disease, general condition of the patient, and the doctor’s discretion because not using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) despite the contraindications can lead to fatal complications or even death.\xa0' Gestational age of over 34 weeks Birth weight of more than 2000 g No significant bleeding disorders No major intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain) Mechanical ventilation for less than 10-14 days  Reversible lung disease  No fatal birth malformations No major untreatable cardiac malformation Failure of maximal medical therapy"
How is pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation performed?,"'Starting pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) requires a large team of caregivers to stabilize the baby and those training in handling patients of the pediatric age group. A fully equipped multidisciplinary setup is required. Although ECMO can be performed by the bedside under local anesthesia, children and babies may require sedation to be able to cooperate with the procedure. The ECMO pump is primed with fluid and blood. The procedure is performed by attaching the ECMO pump to the baby through catheters (a tube put into the body to remove body fluids) that are placed into large blood vessels in the baby/child’s neck or groin.' "
What are the complications of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?,"'Babies and children who are considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are already very sick. Hence, they are at high risk for long-term complications, including death due to their underlying disease and age. Once they are placed on ECMO, some risks of the procedure include' Bleeding Blood clot formation Infection Need for blood transfusions, which carry risks The pump can have mechanical/technical problems (tube breaks, system dysfunction, etc.)"
What is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure for placing a tube for feeding without having to perform an open operation on the abdomen (laparotomy). It is used in patients who will be unable to take in food by mouth for a prolonged period of time. A gastrostomy, or surgical opening into the stomach, is made through the skin using an a flexible, lighted instrument (endoscope) passed orally into the stomach to assist with the placement of the tube and secure it in place.' "
What is the purpose of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'The purpose of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is to feed those patients who cannot swallow food. Irrespective of the age of the patient or their medical condition, the purpose of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is to provide fluids and ''nutrition'' directly into the stomach.' "
Who does percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is done by a physician. The physician may be a general surgeon, an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), radiologist, or a ''gastroenterologist'' (gastrointestinal specialist).' "
Where is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy done (PEG)?,'PEG is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility. It is not necessary to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in an operating room.' 
How is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) performed?,"'Local anesthesia (usually ''lidocaine'' or another spray) is used to anesthetize the throat. An endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and a light on the end) is passed through the mouth, throat and ''esophagus'' into the stomach. The physician then makes a small incision (cut) in the skin of the abdomen over the stomach and pushes a needle through the skin and into the stomach. The tube for feeding then is pushed through the needle and into the stomach. The tube then is sutured (tied) in place to the skin.' "
When can the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy patient go home (PEG)?,"'The patient usually can go home the same day or the next morning, unless they are in the hospital for other reasons.' "
What are the possible complications with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Possible complications include infection of the puncture site (as in any kind of surgery,) dislodgement of the tube with leakage of the ''liquid diet'' that is fed through the tube into the abdomen, and clogging of the tube.' "
What are the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy takes less time, carries less risk and costs less than a surgical gastrostomy which requires opening the abdomen. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is commonly performed, so there are many physicians with experience in performing the procedure. When feasible, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is preferable to a surgical gastrostomy.' "
What is a pelvic exam?,"""A pelvic exam is an examination of a woman's genital system. A pelvic exam examines organs including the vulva, vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes; the bladder and rectum are also usually included in the exam. A pelvic exam involves visual examination of the external genitalia and an internal visual exam of the vaginal walls and cervix using a speculum to open the vaginal canal. It also involves palpation, or examination by feeling the size and shape of the pelvic organs."" "
Why is a pelvic exam performed?,"'A pelvic exam may be performed as part of a regular checkup (or wellness visit) or can be done to investigate symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, unusual ''vaginal discharge'', or ''pain''. Pelvic exams are also done during ''pregnancy'' check-ups. Pelvic exams are necessary for ''cervical cancer'' screenings, in which a sample of cells from the uterine opening (cervix) are taken for microscopic examination (known as the ''Pap smear'' or ''Pap test'').' "
What conditions can be evaluated with a pelvic exam?,"'A pelvic exam can be useful in the evaluation and diagnosis of multiple conditions. ''Some examples include:'  sexually-transmitted infections, such 
as gonorrhea,
	syphilis, 
	Trichomonas, 
	human papillomavirus, and 
	Chlamydia 
bacterial vaginosis yeast infections urinary tract infections abnormal uterine bleeding fibroid tumors ovarian cysts  infertility polycystic ovary syndrome rectal bleeding endometriosis tumors of the genital organs 
genital warts pregnancy ectopic pregnancy"
How is a pelvic exam performed?,"""There is no special preparation needed for a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam is performed in the doctor's office and takes only a few minutes. The woman undergoing the exam lies on an examination table, covered with a sheet. The doctor and/or nurse will help the woman get in position for the speculum examination, which involves bending the knees and placing the ""'feet'' in metal supports on the side of the exam table. The speculum is a metal or ''plastic'' device that is inserted into the vagina to allow the vaginal walls and cervix to be seen. A small sample of the cells of the cervix is taken by a brush or a small spatula for the Pap test. While there may be some discomfort, a pelvic exam should not be painful. ''A bimanual exam is another component of the pelvic exam. This involves placement of two fingers inside the vaginal canal and pressing on the lower abdomen with the other hand to palpate (feel) the pelvic organs. A rectal exam is also often performed at this time. The bimanual exam may reveal enlarged organs or tissue masses.' "
What causes pelvic inflammatory disease?,"""Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. Usually PID is caused by bacteria from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sometimes PID is caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina. If left untreated, PID can cause problems ""'getting pregnant'', problems during ''pregnancy'', and long-term ''pelvic pain''.' "
How common is pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Each year in the United States, more than 1 million women have an episode of PID. More than 100,000 women become ''infertile'' each year because of PID. Also, many ectopic ''pregnancies'' that occur are due to problems from PID.' "
Are some women more likely to get pelvic inflammatory disease?,'PID affects about 5 percent of women in theUnited States. Your risk for PID is higher if you: '   Have had an STI Have had PID before Are younger than 25 and have sex. PID is most common in women 15 to 24 years old. Have more than one sex partner or have a partner who has multiple sexual partners Douche. Douching can push bacteria into the reproductive organs and cause PID. Douching can also hide the signs of PID  Recently had an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted. The risk of PID is higher for the first few weeks only after insertion of an IUD. PID is rare after that time period. Getting tested for STIs before the IUD is inserted lowers your risk for PID.
What are the signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Many women do not know they have PID, because they do not have any signs or symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can be mild or more serious. Signs and symptoms include:''If you think that you may have PID, see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.'   Pain in the lower abdomen (this is the most common symptom) Fever (100.4 F or higher) Vaginal discharge that may smell foul Painful sex Painful urination Irregular periods Pain in the upper right abdomen"
What is the treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat PID. Most of the time, at least two antibiotics are used that work against many different types of bacteria. ''You must take all of your antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away.'' This helps to make sure the infection is fully cured. See your doctor or nurse again two to three days after starting the antibiotics to make sure they are working.'  "
What should I do if I think I have an STI (sexually transmitted disease),"'If you think you may have an STI, see a doctor right away.'' You may feel scared or shy about asking for information or help. Keep in mind, the sooner you seek treatment, the less likely the STI will cause you severe harm. And the sooner you tell your sex partner(s) that you have an STI, the less likely they are to infect you again or spread the disease to others.''To learn about STIs or get tested, contact your doctor, local health department, or an STI and ''family planning'' clinic. The American Social Health Association (ASHA) keeps lists of clinics and doctors who provide treatment for STIs. Call ASHA at 800-227-8922. You can get information from the phone line without leaving your name.' "
How can I keep myself from getting PID?,"'You may not be able to prevent PID. It is not always caused by an STI. Sometimes, normal bacteria in your vagina can travel up to your reproductive organs and cause PID. But you can lower your risk of PID by not douching. You can also prevent STIs by not having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:''The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI.' Use condoms. Condoms are the best way to prevent STIs when you have sex. Because a man does not need to ejaculate (come) to give or get STIs, make sure to put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth, or anus. Other methods of birth control, such as birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STIs. Get tested. Be sure you and your partner are tested for STIs. Talk to each other about the test results before you have sex. Be monogamous. Having sex with just one partner can lower your risk for STIs. After being tested for STIs, be faithful to each other. That means that you have sex only with each other and no one else. Limit your number of sex partners. Your risk of getting STIs goes up with the number of partners you have. Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection. Douching may also raise your risk for PID by helping bacteria travel to other areas, like your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much alcohol or using drugs increases risky behavior and may put you at risk of sexual assault and possible exposure to STIs."

Can you have pelvic inflammatory disease without having an STD?,"'In about 10% of cases, ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) may occur without having an ''STD''.''PID is the infection and swelling of the female reproductive organs. It can involve the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. The risk of ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) increases if one has ''STDs''/STIs (''sexually transmitted diseases''/infection), such as ''gonorrhea'' and ''chlamydia'' or a history of STD.' "
What causes pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'The majority of PID is sexually transmitted. Nonsexual PID may occur in''The most common causative microorganisms of PID are sexually transmitted. They include''Several other bacteria can also cause PID, such as' Septic abortions During the medical termination of pregnancy if there is improper sterilization of tools Procedures like dilation and curettage Rupture of an abscess inside the abdomen and it has spread to the uterine tubes Gonorrhea (most common) Chlamydia (most common) Trichomonas Mycoplasma Staphylococcus Klebsiella E.coli Fusobacteria Clostridia Actinomyces Bacteroides"
What are the risk factors of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Some factors that can increase the risk of PID are' Having unprotected sexual intercourse Being a sexually active women younger than 25 years old Having multiple sexual partners Being in a sexual relationship with a person who has multiple sexual partners Frequent vaginal douching that creates an imbalance of good versus harmful bacteria in the vagina Using a tampon, intrauterine device (IUD) or douche within the 3- to 6-week-long period after an abortion or childbirth when the mouth of the uterus remains open and is susceptible to infection Using a long-term birth control device, such as an IUD Having a history of STDs or PID"
What are the signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'The signs and symptoms of ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' vary with each individual. Some may have mild or no signs and symptoms while others may have severe symptoms. Some common signs and symptoms include' Lower abdominal pain that may be mild or severe Fever with or without chills Heavy, foul smelling vaginal discharge Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially between menstrual cycles and during or after intercourse Pain during urination and increased frequency of urination Painful sexual intercourse"
When to see a doctor,"'The following require immediate medical attention' Severe abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting High-grade fever, above 101° F (38.3° C) Worsening of odor and quantity of vaginal discharge Profuse vaginal bleeding"
Can pelvic inflammatory disease be prevented?,"'The following can help reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease' Safe sexual practices: Using a condom every time during intercourse, limiting the number of sexual partners and being aware of the partner's sexual history can reduce the risk of STDs and PID. Consulting a doctor about contraception: Only barrier methods of contraception, such as condoms and diaphragms, can reduce the risk of PID and STDs. Using long-term birth control devices like IUDs can increase the risk of PID. The doctor can recommend alternate birth control methods. Maintaining hygiene: Maintaining hygiene of the reproductive area and overall body hygiene can reduce the risk of PID. Avoiding vaginal douching: Douching causes an imbalance between good and bad bacteria, negatively affecting vaginal health. Safe childbirth and abortions: It is advised to avoid home births because they can increase the risk of infection after delivery, which can lead to PID. It is also advised to avoid getting an abortion done in centers that are not licensed because they may not follow standard hygiene protocols. Getting tested regularly: It is advised that sexually active women and men, who are at risk of getting an STD, get tested regularly. This helps in early diagnosis and treatment, reducing the risk of complications. Periodic visits to the gynecologist: Since PID can be caused by a wide range of microorganisms and many women may be asymptomatic for a long time, periodic consultations with the gynecologist can help detect diseases early and maintain reproductive health."
What should I know about pelvic pain? ,"'The medical definition of ''pelvic pain'' is perceived ''pain'' in the pelvic area and the lower part of the abdomen located between the hip bones. Usually, the term ''pelvic pain'' is used to refer to ''pain'' in the reproductive organs (uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina) in women.''Pelvic pain in women inclulde, ''menstrual cramps'', ''endometriosis'', pain from a ruptured ''ectopic pregnancy'', ''ovarian cysts'' or other masses, and ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID). Pain that does not originate in the reproductive organs and ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTI''), intestinal obstruction, ''colitis'', tumors, ''appendicitis'', and other conditions.''Other signs and symptoms of pelivc pain include ''fever'' and ''chills'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or ''constipation'', blood in the stools, and pain during and after sexual intercourse.''The treatment for pelivc pain in men and women depend on what is causing it.' "
What is pelvic pain?,"'Pelvic pain is typically considered to be pain in the lower front of the abdomen, below the umbilicus (belly button). Pelvic pain sometimes arises due to problems with the female reproductive organs, but pelvic pain can occur in both men and women due to other causes.''Pelvic pain can arise due to both acute and chronic problems. Acute pelvic pain is new pain that you have not experienced before. ''Chronic pain'' is pain that persists over time. In the pelvis, acute pain is more common than ''chronic pain''.''Pelvic pain can have a number of different causes. Some of the most common causes will be discussed in this article.' "
What does the pelvis look like?,"'Technically, the pelvis refers to the bones of the hip that rest on the legs and support the spine. It also can refer to the cavity inside these bones, the lower portion of the trunk of the body.' "
What causes pelvic pain in women?,"'In women, pelvic pain can occur due to ''pregnancy''-related causes or problems with the reproductive organs in women who are not ''pregnant''. Causes of pelvic pain in women include.''Menstrual cramps'' or problems (cramps during ''menstruation'')''. The medical term for menstrual pain is ''dysmenorrhea''. Many women experience mild menstrual pain, but for some women the pain is severe and disrupts their participation in day-to-day activities.''Ovarian ''cysts'' can cause pain if they become large, rupture (burst), or become twisted (known as torsion of an ''ovarian cyst''). Most ovarian cysts are small, benign (non-cancerous) and do not cause symptoms.''Fibroid'' tumors'' are benign growths of muscle tissue (a ''fibroid'' is also known as a leiomyoma) that are common in the uterus (womb). These do not usually cause pain or symptoms, but if they are very large, they may cause heavy menstrual bleeding or swelling of the abdomen. Pelvic pain can arise if there is degeneration (death of ''tumor'' cells) within a large ''fibroid'' tumor. This happens when a fibroid tumor outgrows its blood supply and starts to shrink.''Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)'' is a condition in which there is widespread inflammation within the reproductive organs, usually due to an infection. The infection is typically a sexually-transmitted disease like ''gonorrhea'' or ''chlamydia''. ''Fever'', ''vaginal bleeding'', and ''vaginal discharge'' usually accompany the pelvic pain of PID.''Endometriosis'' ''is the presence of tissue like the lining of the uterus in other areas of the reproductive organs or elsewhere in the body. It is most common in women in their 30s and can cause heavy periods, severe menstrual cramps, and pelvic pain during sex. A similar condition is adenomyosis, in which areas of uterine lining tissue are located abnormally in the muscle wall of the uterus.''Ovulation'' can cause pelvic pain. This occurs when the ovary releases an egg at the midpoint of the ''menstrual cycle''. Typically, it is felt on the right or left side, depending upon which ovary the egg has come from. The term ""Mittelschmerz"" has been used to refer to this kind of pain.''Pelvic congestion syndrome'' refers to a buildup of blood in the veins of the pelvis. men.''Pain in the vulva'', which may be accompanied by burning or stinging sensations, or pain during sex.''Rarely, ''cancers'','' including ''cervical cancer'', ''uterine cancer'', or ''ovarian cancer''.' "
What causes pelvic pain during pregnancy?,"'Some causes of pelvic pain described above, for example, pelvic inflammatory disease can occur in pregnant women. But there are other causes of pelvic pain that are specific to pregnancy.''Ectopic pregnancy'' is a pregnancy that develops outside the womb (uterus). The most common location for an ectopic pregnancy is the Fallopian tube. An ectopic pregnancy can lead to life-threatening bleeding if it ruptures. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include abdominal and pelvis pain along with ''vaginal bleeding''.''Miscarriage'' ''is the loss of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Vaginal bleeding is a common symptom of miscarriage, although pain also may occur.''Preterm or premature ''labor'' is the onset of signs of ''labor'' before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Symptoms include pelvis fullness, pain, or cramping; backache; and leakage of fluid from the vagina.''Placental abruption'', also known as abruptio placentae, is a serious medical condition in which the placenta becomes separated from the wall of the uterus. Pelvic or ''back pain'' may result, which can be accompanied by vaginal bleeding.' "
What causes pelvic pain in men?,"'Chronic prostatitis'' (chronic nonbacterial prostatitichronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), is a condition that can cause chronic pelvic pain in men. The cause is poorly understood. This pain is sometimes referred to as prostatodynia.''Acute or chronic ''prostatitis'' (inflammation of the prostate often due to bacterial infection) is another source of pelvic pain in men.'  "
What causes pelvic pain in women and men?,"'Causes of pelvic pain in both women and men include problems with the digestive tract, bone ''fractures'', conditions affecting the urinary tract, or other issues. The following are some of the main causes of pelvic pain in men and women.''Appendicitis'', inflammation of the ''appendix'', can cause acute abdominal or pelvic pain along with ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''.''Kidney stones'' or ''kidney infection'' ''(''pyelonephritis'') with ''blood in the urine'' and fever.''Cystitis'' and other ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTIs'')'' accompanied by blood or pus in the urine. ''Low back pain'' can be another symptom of urinary tract infections.''Interstitial cystitis'' involves inflammation of the bladder walls and can cause chronic pelvic pain. With interstitial cystitis, there are no signs or symptoms of infection.''Intestinal conditions'' that result in inflammation or abscesses in the bowel can be a source of pelvic pain. These can include bowel obstruction, ''diverticulitis'', or an ''abscess''.''Inflammatory bowel diseases'"" including Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'' (UC) are chronic conditions.''Hernia'' occurs when the abdominal wall is weakened, and abdominal organs may protrude through the area of ''weakness''. Sometimes the tissues that are found inside of a hernia have a decreased blood supply and cause severe pain.''Irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') ''is a condition that often causes abdominal or pelvic pain along with ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', ''bloating'', and ''gas''.''Broken bones of the pelvis''.''Sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs'')'', such as ''gonorrhea'' or ''chlamydia'', can cause pain as well as burning with urination, and urinary or vaginal discharge.''Post-surgical adhesions'' (''abdominal adhesions'') occur when ''scar tissue'' forms abnormal connections between parts of the body after surgery. For certain surgeries involving organs of the pelvis, these adhesions can develop and cause pain.''Muscle spasms'' of the muscles of the pelvic floor can be a cause of pelvic pain that can become chronic. An example is the ''rectal pain'' caused by levator ani syndrome or levator syndrome, caused by spasms of the levator ani muscle. This has also been referred to as chronic proctalgia.''Anal fissure'' is a painful tear or ''crack'' in the lining of the anus.'  "
What other symptoms are associated with pelvic pain?,"'Depending on the cause of pelvic pain, there may be other associated symptoms, including ''abdominal pain'', tenderness, or distension, fever and chills, nausea, vomiting, ''diarrhea'' or ''constipation'', pain during or after sexual intercourse, vaginal discharge or bleeding, blood or pus in the urine, ''cloudy urine'', ''blood in the stool'', and ''low back pain''.' "
When should I call my doctor for pelvic pain?,"""It's important to seek medical care for any unexplained or new pain that is associated with troubling symptoms. In particular, seek medical care if you notice pain, cramping, or bleeding during pregnancy; ""'blood in the urine'' or ''stool''; abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge; high fever; or severe pain.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat pelvic pain?,"'Because the causes of pelvic pain are so numerous, the type of doctor consulted will depend on the nature of the pain and the associated symptoms. It is always appropriate to seek care from a primary care provider, including internists, family physicians, and pediatricians. Gynecologists may diagnose and manage pelvic pain related to organs of the female reproductive system. Surgeons may be consulted for problems that require surgical correction. Other specialists that may be involved with managing certain causes of pelvic pain include gastroenterologists, orthopedists, urologists, and oncologists.' "
What is the treatment for pelvic pain?,'Treatment for pelvic pain depends upon the underlying cause of the pain and may involve medications or surgery.' 
How is pelvic pain diagnosed?,"'Your health-care professional will first ask you questions about the pelvic pain, including when the pain began, if there are other associated symptoms, what relieves the pain, and if you have any other medical conditions. A physical exam and laboratory studies of blood and urine are the next step in the evaluation. Depending upon your situation, a number of different diagnostic tests may ordered, for example, transvaginal ''ultrasound'', when conditions involving the female reproductive organs are suspected, CT, ''MRI'', or ultrasound imaging studies of the pelvis and abdomen, ''colonoscopy'', and ''laparoscopy'', cultures of abnormal discharge from the vagina or urethra, and pelvic ''X-rays''.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with pelvic pain?,"'The prognosis can be excellent for certain types of pelvic pain, such as an ectopic pregnancy that has not ruptured or an uncomplicated ''UTI''. Other types of pelvic pain are likely to recur and may become chronic, such as prostatitis, ''endometriosis'', interstitial cystitis, or muscle spasms. Conditions like ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's disease persist over time. Pelvic pain due to cancers likely has the most guarded prognosis, and outcomes in these cases depend upon the stage (extent of spread) of ""'cancer'', the specific type of ''cancer'' that is present, and the types of treatments available.' "
Can pelvic pain be prevented?,"'Pelvic pain can only be prevented to the extent that the specific cause of pain can be prevented. For example, ''safe sex'' practices can help prevent sexually-transmitted diseases, reducing the risk of pelvic pain from these infections. Maintaining adequate hydration can help reduce the risk of kidney stones in some cases.' "
Facts you should know about bullous pemphigoid, Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune skin disease characterized by blisters. The cause of bullous pemphigoid is not known. Bullous pemphigoid can involve the lining of the mouth and nose. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is ultimately confirmed by biopsy. Treatment of bullous pemphigoid is individualized and depends on the location and severity of the disease.
What is bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid is an uncommon skin disease characterized by tense blisters on the surface of the skin. Occasionally, the inner lining tissue of the mouth, nasal passages, or conjunctivae of the eyes (mucous membrane tissue) can be involved. The condition is caused by antibodies and inflammation abnormally accumulating in a particular layer of the skin or mucous membranes. This layer of tissue is called the ""basement membrane."" These antibodies (immunoglobulins) bind to proteins in the basement membrane called hemidesmosomal BP antigens and this attracts cells of inflammation. The mucous membrane disease is also referred to separately as mucous membrane pemphigoid.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of bullous pemphigoid?,"'Symptoms of bullous pemphigoid include intense ''itching'' and burning sensation of the skin. When the mucous membranes of the mouth are affected, it can cause ''pain'', burning, peeling away of affected inner lining tissues, and sensitivity to acidic foods. Eating can be difficult, and involvement in the deeper areas of the throat can cause ''coughing''. Involvement of the inner nose can cause ''nosebleeds''. The disease typically worsens and improves over time.'  "
What are bullous pemphigoid causes and risk factors?,"'A majority of those affected by bullous pemphigoid are 50 years of age or older. While the cause is unknown, it is felt by some that an ''aging'' immune system may become activated in certain individuals with a genetic predisposition to develop bullous pemphigoid.' "
Is bullous pemphigoid contagious?,'No. Bullous pemphigoid cannot be transmitted from one person to another.' 
What types of specialists treat bullous pemphigoid?,'Bullous pemphigoid is diagnosed and treated by dermatologists.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid is often diagnosed by clinical examination and is confirmed by the results of a biopsy of involved tissue. The biopsy with traditional pathology evaluation can demonstrate inflammation of the affected skin levels. Additional testing of the biopsy specimen for antibody immune deposits can reveal the abnormal antibodies located in the basement membrane layer of skin or mucous membrane tissue. Blood testing for circulating basement membrane antibodies can also be helpful.''Bullous pemphigoid-like condition can sometimes be associated with other illnesses, including ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'' or ''lupus'') and ''cancer''.' "
What is the treatment for bullous pemphigoid?,"'Bullous pemphigoid can be chronic and mild without substantially disturbing the general health of affected individuals. It can also significantly affect daily lives in its more severe forms. Mild bullous pemphigoid can resolve with topical prescription ''corticosteroid'' creams but sometimes requires high doses of steroids taken internally. Severe bullous pemphigoid can also require immune-suppression ''drugs'' such as ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), mycophenolate (''Cellcept''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex''). The ''tetracycline'' derivatives such as ''minocycline'' or ''doxycycline'' have also been used as an option to reduce inflammation. Other treatments that have been used for severe disease include intravenous immunoglobulin infusions, typically given monthly.''Research has indicated that large quantities of high-potency ''topical corticosteroids'' applied to the body surface are safer in controlling localized bullous pemphigoid than oral ''corticosteroids''. It was felt by the researchers that topical corticosteroids should now be the treatment of choice for bullous pemphigoid, particularly when the disease is not extensive.'  "
Are there home remedies for bullous pemphigoid?,'No. There are no home remedies for bullous pemphigoid other than preventing skin irritation and infection from scratching.' 
What is the prognosis of bullous pemphigoid?,"'The outlook for bullous pemphigoid is variable. As described above, the symptoms tend to wax and wane. In its most severe form it can be fatal without treatment, especially if involving the airways and pharynx.' "
Is it possible to prevent bullous pemphigoid?,'No. There is no ''prevention'' for bullous pemphigoid.' 
What is Pendred syndrome?,"'Pendred syndrome is a ''genetic disorder'' that causes early ''hearing loss'"" in children. It also can affect the thyroid gland and sometimes may affect a person's balance. The syndrome is named after Vaughan Pendred, the physician who first described individuals with the disorder. ""'Children who are born with Pendred syndrome may begin to lose their ''hearing'' at birth or by the time they are three years old. The hearing loss is progressive, which means that a child will have less hearing over time. Some individuals may become totally deaf. '""The loss of hearing often happens suddenly and in stages. Sometimes, after a sudden decrease in hearing, a person's hearing will nearly return to its previous level. Almost all people with Pendred syndrome have bilateral ""'hearing loss'', or hearing loss in both ears. The hearing loss often is greater in one ear than in the other. ' "
How does Pendred syndrome affect other parts of the body?,"'Pendred syndrome can affect the thyroid by causing it to grow too large. An enlarged thyroid gland also is called a goiter. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck, just above your collarbones. The thyroid plays a major role in how your body uses energy from food. In children, the thyroid is important for normal growth and development. Children with Pendred syndrome, however, rarely have problems growing and developing properly even if their thyroid is affected. ''Roughly 60 percent of individuals with Pendred syndrome will develop a goiter in their lifetime. Most people with Pendred syndrome are in their ''teens'' or twenties before they develop a goiter. If a goiter becomes large, a person may have problems ''breathing'"" and swallowing. A health professional is needed to check a person's goiter over time and decide what treatment is necessary. ""'Pendred syndrome also may affect the ''vestibular system'', which controls balance. About 40 percent of individuals with Pendred syndrome will show some ''vestibular'' ''weakness'' when their balance system is tested. However, the brain is very good at making up for a weak vestibular system, and most children and adults with Pendred syndrome do not have a problem with their balance or have difficulty doing routine tasks. Some ''babies'' with Pendred syndrome may start ''walking'' later than other babies. ''It is not known why some individuals with Pendred syndrome develop a goiter or have balance problems and others do not. ' "
What causes Pendred syndrome?,"""Pendred syndrome can be caused by changes, or mutations, to a gene known as SLC26A4 (also referred to as the PDS gene) on  chromosome 7. Because it is a recessive trait, a child needs to inherit two mutated SLC26A4 genes—one from each parent—to have Pendred syndrome. The child's parents do not need to have Pendred syndrome to be a carrier of a mutation in the SLC26A4 gene. ""'Couples who are concerned that they might be able to pass Pendred syndrome on to their children may seek genetic testing. A possible sign that a person may be a carrier of a mutated SLC26A4 gene is a family history of early hearing loss. Another sign is a family member who has both a goiter and hearing loss. A mutation in the SLC26A4 gene can be determined by genetic testing that uses a blood sample. ''The decision to have a genetic test is complex. Most people receive assistance from a genetic counselor trained to help them weigh the medical, emotional, and ethical considerations. A genetic counselor is a health professional who provides information and support to individuals and families who have a ''genetic disease'' or who are at risk for such a disease. ' "
How is Pendred syndrome diagnosed?,"""A physician called an otolaryngologist or a clinical geneticist will consider a person's hearing, inner ear structures, and sometimes the thyroid in diagnosing Pendred syndrome. The specialist will evaluate the timing, amount, and pattern of hearing loss. He or she will ask questions such as:""'Early hearing loss is one of the most common characteristics of Pendred syndrome; however, this symptom alone does not mean a child has the condition. ''The specialist uses inner ear imaging techniques known as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') or computed tomography (CT or CAT) to look for two key characteristics of Pendred syndrome. One characteristic might be a cochlea with too few turns. The cochlea is the spiral-shaped part of the inner ear that converts sound into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. A healthy cochlea has two-and-a-half turns, but the cochlea of a person with Pendred syndrome may have only one-and-a-half turns. ''A second characteristic of Pendred syndrome is enlarged vestibular aqueducts (see figure). The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal that runs from the vestibule (a part of the inner ear between the cochlea and the semicircular canals) to the inside of the skull. Inside the vestibular aqueduct is a fluid-filled tube called the endolymphatic duct, which ends at a balloon-shaped endolymphatic sac. When the vestibular aqueduct is enlarged, the endolymphatic duct and sac grow large with excess fluid in comparison to their normal sizes. The function of the vestibular aqueduct is not well understood. ''Picture of the Inner Ear''''When screening for Pendred syndrome, it is not recommended to test the blood for ''thyroid hormone'' because the amount usually is the same whether someone has Pendred syndrome or not. Some people may receive a ""perchlorate washout test,"" a test that determines whether the thyroid is functioning properly. Although this test is probably the best test for determining thyroid function in Pendred syndrome, it is not used often and may be replaced by genetic testing. Individuals who have a goiter may be referred to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in glandular disorders, to determine whether the goiter is due to Pendred syndrome or to another cause. Goiter is a common feature of Pendred syndrome, but many individuals who develop a goiter do not have Pendred syndrome. Conversely, many people who have Pendred syndrome never develop a goiter. '  ""When did the hearing loss start?,""  ""Has it worsened over 
time?,"" and  ""Did it happen suddenly or in stages?."" "
How common is Pendred syndrome?,"'Scientists estimate that about two to three children out of every 1,000 have early hearing loss, and about half of these cases are ''inherited'"". The SLC26A4 gene, which causes Pendred syndrome, accounts for about five to ten percent of hereditary hearing loss. As researchers gain more insight about the syndrome and its features, they hope to improve doctors' ability to detect and diagnose the disorder in people. "" "
Can Pendred syndrome be treated?,"'Treatment options are available for individuals with Pendred syndrome. Because the syndrome is inherited and can involve thyroid and balance problems, many specialists may be involved in treatment. The treatment team may include a primary care physician, an  audiologist, an endocrinologist, a clinical geneticist, a genetic counselor, an otolaryngologist, and a speech-language pathologist. ''To reduce the likelihood of progression of hearing loss, individuals with Pendred syndrome should:''Pendred syndrome cannot be cured. However, the medical team can help parents and individuals make informed choices about treatment options. They also can help them prepare for increased hearing loss and other possible long-term consequences of the syndrome. ''Children with Pendred syndrome should start early treatment to learn skills that will help them communicate, such as learning sign language or cued speech or how to use a hearing aid. Most individuals with Pendred syndrome will have hearing loss significant enough to be considered eligible for a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant is an electronic device that is surgically inserted into the cochlea. A cochlear implant does not restore or create normal hearing. Instead, a cochlear implant helps a person develop a new way of understanding speech. Children over 12 months of age as well as adults are eligible to receive an implant. ''Individuals with Pendred syndrome who develop a goiter need to have it checked regularly. The goiter in Pendred syndrome is unusual because the thyroid is making the right amount of thyroid hormone but it is growing in size. Such a goiter often is called a euthyroid goiter. '  avoid contact sports that might lead to 
head injury; 
	 wear head protection when engaged in activities that might lead to head injury 
(such as bicycle riding or skiing); and  avoid situations that can lead to
	barotrauma (extreme, 
rapid changes in pressure), such as scuba diving or hyperbaric oxygen treatment. 
	"
What research is being conducted?,"'NIDCD has been working to understand hearing loss caused by inherited syndromes such as Pendred syndrome as well as from other causes. Researchers also are looking carefully at the characteristics of the disorder and how the syndrome might cause problems in such different parts of the body as the thyroid and inner ear. ''Scientists continue to study the genetic basis of Pendred syndrome. The protein that the SLC26A4 gene encodes, called pendrin, is found in the inner ear, kidney, and thyroid gland. Researchers have identified more than 90 deafness-causing mutations or alterations of this gene. ''Scientists have altered the gene in mice so that the mice have an abnormal SLC26A4 gene. The study of these mice is providing information on how the abnormal gene affects the form and function of different parts of the body. For example, by studying the inner ears of mice with SLC26A4 mutations, scientists now realize that the enlarged vestibular aqueduct associated with Pendred syndrome is not caused by a sudden stop in the normal development of the ear. Studies such as this are important because they help scientists rule out some causes of a disorder while helping to identify areas needing more research. Eventually, researchers are hopeful that these studies will lead to therapies that can target the basic causes of the condition.

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "

How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing.

What is Peyronie's disease?,"""Peyronie's disease (also termed Peyronie disease) is the development of scar tissue inside the penis that causes the penis to develop abnormal curvature (contracture) in the scarred area. The disease may occur in about 1% to 8% of men, most frequently in men aged about 40 to 70 years old. The disease also may occur more frequently with men who\xa0develop:""'Occasionally, the disease\xa0can occur in younger men.'   Prostate cancer High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes"
What are the symptoms of Peyronie's disease?,"""The symptoms of Peyronie's disease usually are a combination of one or more symptoms as follows:""   Unusual angulation of the penile shaft (either when flaccid or erect or both) Pain during erections and/or during sex Scarring or plaque palpated at the abnormal bend or angle of the penis An indentation of the penis shaft at the site of the plaque or scarring Erectile dysfunction Anxiety/stress Inability to have intercourse"
What causes Peyronie's disease?,"""The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is not known. However, whatever can cause plaque or scar formation in the penile shaft is a likely causal candidate. Researchers have suggested several possible agents such as vitamin E deficiency, beta-blocking medications, elevations in serotonin, and genetic causes. Some researchers think that minor vascular traumas to the penis (during sex, athletic or ""'exercise'' endeavors) that occur repeatedly over time may lead to scar formation. None of these possible agents or processes is proven to be the cause to date.'  "
What are the phases of Peyronie's disease?,"""There are, in general, two phases of Peyronie's disease."" The acute phase lasts about 18 to 24 months and usually has the highest pain component. The chronic phase (begins at about 18 to 24 months after first symptoms) usually has less pain but in this stage, the plaque or scarring is more refractory to treatment (see below) and may begin to develop large calcium deposits (calcified plaque or scarring)."
What procedures and tests diagnose Peyronie's disease?,"""The patient's history of pain with erections and/or sex and the physical examination of the penis that shows abnormal angulation of the penile shaft or the presence of plaque or scarring felt or palpated in the penis is usually the basis for diagnosis. Urologists are specialists who usually diagnose and treat this disease. There are no definitive blood tests for this disease, although a human cell antigen, HLA-B7 has been associated with the disease. In general, no additional tests are necessary, but ""'ultrasound'' techniques, when accompanied by an injection of drug into the penis (intercavernous injection) can help show the doctor where and how extensive is the scarring, and aid the doctor in determining treatments.' "
What is the treatment for Peyronie's disease?,"""Several types of treatments are designed to reduce the symptoms of Peyronie's disease.""  "
"Medications, home remedies, vitamins, and supplements","'In December, 2013, the FDA approved ''collagenase clostridium histolyticum'' (''Xiaflex'"") to treat individuals with Peyronie's disease. Each treatment cycle consists of two Xiaflex injections into the plaque in the penis to break up the collagen that causes the curvature deformity. Treatments consist of a maximum four injections.""'Oral therapy with vitamin E, ''colchicine'', PABA, ''tamoxifen'', and other medications have been tried with limited success in some patients. Usually those in the acute phase of the disease responded best.''In the early stages of the disease, erectile dysfunction (''ED'') may be treated with such drugs as ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra''), and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis'', Adcirca).''Injection therapy uses combinations of drugs mentioned above and adds prostaglandin E1 or other drugs such as betamethasone alone or with hyaluronidase; PABA has been reported to reduce the penile plaque size.''Other drugs have also been used with varying degree of success. ''Verapamil'' (''Calan'', ''Verelan'', Verelan PM, ''Isoptin'', Isoptin SR, ''Covera-HS'' [a medication usually used for ''high blood pressure treatment'""]) appears to disrupt the production of a protein involved in the formation of Peyronie's disease lesions.""'Another method is iontophoresis (also termed electromotive administration or EMDA) where verapamil and other drugs are applied to the penile skin and pushed through the skin with a low electrical current.' "
Shockwave therapy,"'Shockwave therapy (done with a lithotripter device like those used to break up ''kidney stones'') has been used on plaque or scaring that is calcified. Other mechanical devices, including vacuum-based machines and low-dose radiotherapy have been tried. Although some successes are seen with these methods, best results are in acute phase patients. There are ongoing studies with different drugs (for example, interferons, and collagenase) and surgical techniques.' "
Surgery,"""Surgical therapy is done on some patients. These surgical patients usually have to meet criteria that may vary from surgeon to surgeon. In general, surgical therapy is done when other methods have failed or the patient is in the chronic stage of the disease and erectile dysfunction is part of the patient's symptoms. Surgical therapy may involve incision or cutting the scarred tissue, scar tissue removal, scar tissue removal with auto-grafting or artificial graft material. In addition, implanted devices (penile implant) that allow the patient to sustain an erection are also utilized in some individuals."" "
Can exercises help Peyronie's disease?,'Some individuals suggest stretching and/or milking the penis are exercises that can help reduce the penile curvature that occurs in the disease. Patients should discuss these techniques with their doctor (''urologist'') before using these methods.' 
What are the complications of Peyronie's disease?,"'The complications of the disease are mainly the symptoms of:''In addition, surgical complications may include:''Depression'' and stress can become significant complications.'   Pain Painful intercourse Inability to have intercourse due to pain or erectile dysfunction Permanent angulation of the penis Reduction in penis length Infections Loss of any erectile functions"
What is the prognosis for Peyronie's disease? Can it be cured?,"""The prognosis (outcome) of this disease is variable, from good to poor, depending on the response to treatment and the patient's emotional response to the symptoms and treatments.\xa0There is no treatment that will cure Peyronie's disease, but symptoms can be reduced."" "
Penile Prosthesis Introduction,"'A penile prosthesis is another treatment option for men with ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED''). These devices are either malleable or inflatable. The simplest type of prosthesis consists of a pair of malleable (bendable) rods surgically implanted within the erection chambers of the penis. With this type of implant the penis is always semi-rigid and merely needs to be lifted or adjusted into the erect position to initiate sex. Today, many men choose a hydraulic, inflatable prosthesis, which allows a man to have an erection whenever he chooses and is much easier to conceal. It is also more natural.''A penile implant is usually used when there is a clear medical cause for ''ED'"" and when the problem is unlikely to resolve or improve naturally or with other medical treatments. Sometimes a penile prosthesis is implanted during surgery to reconstruct the penis when scarring has caused erections to curve (Peyronie's disease)."" "
How Does the Penile Prosthesis Work?,"'The inflatable penile prosthesis consists of two cylinders -- a reservoir and a pump -- which are placed surgically in the body. The two cylinders are inserted in the penis and connected by tubing to a separate reservoir of fluid. The reservoir is implanted under the groin muscles. A pump is also connected to the system and sits under the loose skin of the scrotal sac, between the testicles.''To inflate the prosthesis, the man presses on the pump. The pump transfers fluid from the reservoir to the cylinders in the penis, inflating them. Pressing on a deflation valve at the base of the pump returns the fluid to the reservoir, deflating the penis.' "
Is the Prosthesis Noticeable?,"'While men who have had the prosthesis surgery can see the small surgical ''scar'' where the bottom of the penis meets the scrotal sac, other people probably will be unable to tell that a man has an inflatable penile prosthesis. Most men would not be embarrassed in a locker room or public restroom, for example.' "
What Is Sex Like With the Prosthesis?,"'When the penis is inflated, the prosthesis makes the penis stiff and thick, similar to a natural erection. Most men rate the erection as shorter than their normal erection; however, newer models have cylinders that may increase the length, thickness, and ''stiffness'' of the penis.'""A penile prosthesis does not change sensation on the skin of the penis or a man's ability to reach ""'orgasm''. Ejaculation is not affected. Once a penile prosthesis is put in, however, it may destroy the natural erection reflex. Men usually cannot get an erection without inflating the implant. If the implant is removed, the man may never again have natural erections.'  "
How Effective Are the Implants?,"'About 90%-95% of inflatable prosthesis implants produce erections suitable for intercourse. Satisfaction rates with the prosthesis are very high, and typically 80%-90% of men are satisfied with the results and say they would choose the surgery again.' "
Is the Implant Safe?,'No surgery is totally free of possible complications. Complications associated with penile implants include:' Uncontrolled bleeding after the surgery possibly leading to re-operation Infection Scar tissue formation Erosion (tissue around the implant may break down) Mechanical failure
Will Insurance Cover the Cost of the Penis Prosthesis Implant?,"'Insurance coverage for these operations is often good, as long as a medical cause of ''ED'' is established. Medicare covers the surgery, but Medicaid does not.' "
Penile cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the penis.,'The penis is a rod-shaped male reproductive organ that passes sperm and urine from the body. It contains two types of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with blood vessels that fill with blood to make an erection):''The erectile tissue is wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin. The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the foreskin.' Corpora cavernosa: The two columns of erectile tissue that form most of the penis. Corpus spongiosum: The single column of erectile tissue that forms a small portion of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine and sperm pass from the body).
Human papillomavirus infection may increase the risk of developing penile cancer.,"""Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for penile cancer include the following:""'Circumcision'' may help prevent infection with the human papillomavirus (''HPV''). A circumcision is an operation in which the doctor removes part or all of the foreskin from the penis. Many boys are circumcised shortly after birth. Men who were not circumcised at birth may have a higher risk of developing penile cancer.''Other risk factors for penile cancer include the following:'  Being age 60 or older. Having phimosis (a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back over the glans). Having poor personal hygiene. Having many sexual partners. Using tobacco products."
"Signs of penile cancer include sores, discharge, and bleeding.","'These and other signs may be caused by penile cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'   Redness, irritation, or a sore on the penis. A lump on the penis."
Tests that examine the penis are used to detect (find) and diagnose penile cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:'  Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking the penis for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal.Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn't look normal. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Incisional biopsy: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn't look normal. Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesn't look normal."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' The stage of the cancer. The location and size of the tumor. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).
Stages of penile cancer,"'After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.''The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:''Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:''When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not ''lung cancer''.''In stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like ''warts'' are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called ''carcinoma in situ''.''In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. The tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.''In stage II, cancer has spread:''Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb.''In stage IIIa, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. Cancer has also spread:''In stage IIIb, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. Cancer has also spread:''In stage IV, cancer has spread:''Recurrent penile cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the penis or in other parts of the body.'   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:Sentinel lymph node biopsy: The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.Lymph node dissection: A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.

There are different types of treatment for patients with penile cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with penile cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Surgery is the most common treatment for all stages of penile cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following operations:''Lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or ''radiation'' therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy.''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\xa0External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat penile cancer.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly onto the skin (topical chemotherapy) or into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Topical chemotherapy may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer.'""Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called ""'biotherapy'' or immunotherapy. Topical biologic therapy with imiquimod may be used to treat stage 0 penile cancer.' Mohs microsurgery: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During the surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove cancer on the skin. It is also called Mohs surgery. Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. Circumcision: Surgery to remove part or the entire foreskin of the penis. Wide local excision: Surgery to remove only the cancer and some normal tissue around it. Amputation of the penis: Surgery to remove part or all of the penis. If part of the penis is removed, it is a partial penectomy. If all of the penis is removed, it is a total penectomy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.,"'This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.''Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells.''Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery''Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the cancer.''For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.''Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment options by stage,"'Treatment of stage 0 may be one of the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''If the cancer is only in the foreskin, wide local excision and circumcision may be the only treatment needed.''Treatment of stage I penile cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage II penile cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III penile cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage IV penile cancer is usually palliative (to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life).

What is the definition of priapism?,"'Priapism is a prolonged, unwanted erection of the penis. It is usually painful and not related to sexual stimulation or arousal. ''Most clinicians consider priapism a medical emergency'' because the condition can result in ''impotence'', sexual dysfunction or penile infection. ' "
What causes priapism?,"'A normal erection occurs in response to sexual stimulation. Priapism occurs in several conditions that interfere with the blood flow to the penis or blood drainage from the penis. This condition is unrelated to sexual stimulation and can last for several hours. Below are some of the causes of priapism.''Medical conditions that can cause priapism:''Trauma'' as a cause of priapism:''Medications (several ''drugs'' have priapism as a side effect):'   Sickle cell disease (most common reason for priapism) Leukemia History of malignancy (cancer) Direct trauma to the penis, pelvis, or perineum Spinal cord injuries Antidepressants Antipsychotics Blood thinners (warfarin [Coumadin] and heparin) Medications to help with erectile dysfunction (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Caverject) Illegal drugs ( cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, crystal meth, cannabis)"
What are the symptoms of priapism?,"'Priapism results in a persistent erection. Priapism is usually divided into three categories.'  Ischemic priapism is the most common category of priapism. Blood is not able to leave the penis causing the erection. This painful event is considered an emergency if it lasts for more than 4 hours. Non-ischemic (high-flow) priapism is the second category of priapism, and much less common. In this form, too much blood flows into the penis. The erection tends to be painless and less rigid then the ischemic form. Suttering priapism is the third category of priapism. In stuttering priapism, the erection occurs repeatedly but is transient in nature."
How is priapism diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of priapism is based on history (asking the patient questions) and the physical exam of the genitalia. Once a health care professional has finished this part of the exam a few other tests might be ordered.' Measurement of blood gas: By inserting a small needle and removing blood from 
	the penis the doctor will be able to establish the oxygen content and therefore 
the type of priapism the patient has. Blood tests: Measuring white and red blood cells and platelets will help 
the health care professional determine why the patient might have a priapism."
What is the treatment for priapism?,"'The treatment of ischemic priapism includes several modalities and will depend on how long the priapism has been present, and the results of the blood tests. These interventions are performed in a step wise fashion with surgery being the last resort. Unfortunately, some of the treatments of priapism can lead to ''erectile dysfunction'' in the future.''Treatments for priapism are as follows:''Ice to the area around the genitals is sometime utilized. In severe cases surgical procedures are available.''Non-ischemic priapism is usually not an emergency and will frequently resolve without interventions.'   Aspiration: Blood is drained from the penis using a 16 or 18 gauge needle and syringe. Medication: A medication that constricts blood vessels that carry blood into the penis (Alpha Adrenergic Sympathomimetic; phenylephrine) is injected into the penis using a small (29 gauge) needle into the corpora cavernosa area of the penis. Surgery: A surgical procedure that reroutes blood can be performed."
What are the complications of priapism?,"'Ischemic priapism can cause significant complications. Due to the lack of oxygen, there can be significant damage if priapism lasts for more than four hours. The complications include ''erectile dysfunction'' as well as disfigurement of the penis.' "
When to see a health care professional,"""A painful erection lasting for more than 4 hours should trigger an emergency department visit. If the unwanted erection resolves in less than four hours a nonemergent doctor's visit should be scheduled."" "
Can priapism be prevented?,'Priapism or recurrence of priapism can be prevented by treating the underlying medical cause that resulted in priapism or changing medications that have priapism as their side effects. No medications should be discontinued or changed until you speak with your healthcare provider.' 
What is balanitis (inflammation of the head of penis)?,"'Balanitis is an inflammation of the skin of the head of penis (glans penis). If the foreskin is involved as well, it is referred to as balanoposthitis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of balanitis? Is it painful?,"'Usually, most common signs and symptoms of balanitis are:''An odorous discharge can accompany these symptoms.'   Redness or mild swelling Iitching Rash Irritation or pain on or around the penis"
What causes balanitis?,"   Balanitis is usually found in uncircumcised males. Poor hygiene can contribute when the area under the foreskin is not washed regularly and bacteria, skin, and sweat accumulate. Some underlying medical conditions can also increase the risk of balanitis, especially diabetes mellitus. Allergies to certain chemicals can cause an allergic balanitis. This could be chemicals in soaps or other products in touch with the glans of the penis. Certain infections (especially yeast infections) can cause a balanitis. Reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome) is associated with inflammation around the head of the penis (circinate balanitis). Balanitis is not a sexually transmitted disease (STD); however, it can have similar symptoms (for example, itching and redness). "
How is balanitis diagnosed?,"'A health care professional will usually be able to diagnose balanitis based on asking the patient questions (history) and physical examination. No additional tests are usually necessary. If a doctor suspects that the balanitis is caused by an underlying medical condition, the patient might require blood tests.' "
Which medications treat balanitis?,"'First, the underlying cause is determined and the treatment directed against the reason for the condition. If there is an infection, the appropriate antifungal medication can be used. If it is a hygiene issue, daily habits are changed. Young boys may require instruction on how to retract and clean their foreskin.''The optimal medications will depend on the underlying cause of the balanitis. For examples, doctors will prescribe a topical antifungal cream if ''Candida'' infection is present, or an antibiotic if a ''cellulitis'' is suspected. In refractory or repeated situations, the doctor might suggest ''circumcision'' as a possible way to prevent further infections by eliminating the overlying foreskin.'  "
Which home remedies or OTC medications soothe pain and treat balanitis?,"'Switching soaps or other possible offending irritants can be helpful. Other times, the doctor will prescribe oral or topical medications.'  "
What is the prognosis for balanitis? Can it be cured?,'The prognosis of balanitis is generally good.' 
Can balanitis be prevented?,"'The risk of balanitis can be reduced with proper hygiene, but not all balanitis can be prevented depending on the underlying cause. ''Circumcision'' has been advocated as a way of preventing or reducing the risk of balanitis in patients who had multiple episodes.' "
What disorders affect the penis?,"'Some disorders that affect the penis include ''priapism'"", Peyronie's disease , ""'balanitis'', ''phimosis'', ''paraphimosis'', and ''penile cancer'' .' "
What is priapism?,"'Priapism is a persistent, often painful erection lasting more than 4 hours in duration. The priapism erection is not associated with sexual activity and is not relieved by ''orgasm''. It occurs when blood flows into the penis but is not adequately drained.' "
What causes priapism?,"'Common causes of priapism include:' Alcohol or drug abuse (especially cocaine) Certain medications, including some antidepressants and blood pressure medications Spinal cord problems Injury to the genitals Anesthesia Penile injection therapy (a treatment for erectile dysfunction) Blood diseases, including leukemia and sickle cell anemia"
How is priapism treated?,"'Treatment for priapism is a medical emergency, because a prolonged erection can ''scar'' the penis and result in a long term complication of ''erectile dysfunction'' if if not treated. The goal of treatment is to relieve the erection and preserve normal penile function. In most cases, treatment involves draining the blood using a needle placed in the side of the penis. Medications that help shrink blood vessels, which decreases blood flow to the penis, also may be used. In rare cases, surgery may be required to avoid permanent damage to the penis. If the condition is due to ''sickle cell disease'', a ''blood transfusion'' may be necessary. Treating any underlying medical condition or ''substance abuse'' problem is important to preventing priapism.' "
What is Peyronie's disease?,"""Peyronie's disease is a condition in which a plaque, or hard lump, forms on the penis. The plaque may develop on the upper (more common) or lower side of the penis, in the layers that contain erectile tissue. The plaque often begins as a localized area of irritation and swelling (inflammation), and can develop into a hardened scar. The scarring reduces the elasticity of the penis in the area affected.""""Peyronie's disease can occur in a mild form that heals without treatment in 6 -18 months. In these cases, the problem does not progress past the inflammation phase. In severe cases, the disease can be permanent. The hardened plaque reduces flexibility, causing ""'pain'' and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection.'""In addition to the bending of the penis, Peyronie's disease can cause general ""'pain'"" as well as painful erections. It also can cause emotional distress, and affect a man's desire and ability to function during sex."" "
What causes Peyronie's disease?,"""The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is unknown. In people whose disease develops quickly, lasts a short time, and goes away without treatment, the likely cause is ""'trauma'"" (hitting or bending) that causes bleeding inside the penis. However, in some people, Peyronie's disease develops slowly and is severe enough to require surgical treatment. Other possible causes of Peyronie's disease include:"" Vasculitis: This is an inflammation of blood or lymphatic vessels. This inflammation can lead to the formation of scar tissue. Connective tissue disorders: According to the National Institutes of Health, about 30% of men with Peyronie's disease also develop disorders that affect the connective tissue in other parts of their bodies, such as the hands and feet. These conditions generally cause a thickening or hardening of the connective tissue. Connective tissue is specialized tissue -- such as cartilage, bone, and skin -- that acts to support other body tissues. Heredity: Some studies suggest that a man who has a relative with Peyronie's disease is at greater risk for developing the disease himself."
How is Peyronie's disease treated?,"""There are two ways in which Peyronie's disease can be treated: surgery or non-surgical treatment.""""Because the plaque of Peyronie's disease often shrinks or disappears without treatment, most doctors suggest waiting one to two years or longer before attempting to correct it with surgery. In many cases, surgery produces positive results. But because complications can occur, and because many of the problems associated with Peyronie's disease (for example, shortening of the penis) are not corrected by surgery, most doctors prefer to perform surgery only on men with curvatures so severe that sexual intercourse is impossible.""""There are two surgical techniques used to treat Peyronie's disease. One method involves the removal of the plaque followed by placement of a patch of skin or artificial material (skin graft). With the second technique, the surgeon removes or pinches the tissue from the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which cancels out the bending effect. The first method can involve partial loss of erectile function, especially rigidity. The second method, known as the Nesbit procedure, causes a shortening of the erect penis.""'Penile implants'"" can be used in cases where Peyronie's disease has affected the man's ability to achieve or maintain an erection.""""A non-surgical treatment for Peyronie's disease involves injecting medication directly into the plaque in an attempt to soften the affected tissue, decrease the pain, and correct the ""'curvature of the penis''. ''Vitamin E'"" pills haves also been shown to benefit some men with Peyronie's disease.""""Another, less invasive option is laser treatment to thin the plaques of Peyronie's disease."" "
What is balanitis?,"'Balanitis is an inflammation of the head of the penis. A similar condition, ''balanoposthitis'', refers to inflammation of the head of the penis and the foreskin. Symptoms of balanitis include redness or swelling, ''itching'', ''rash'', pain and a foul-smelling discharge.' "
What causes balanitis?,"'Balanitis most often occurs in men and boys who have not been circumcised (had their foreskin surgically removed), and who have ''poor hygiene''. Inflammation can occur if the sensitive skin under the foreskin is not washed regularly, allowing sweat, debris, dead skin and bacteria to collect under the foreskin and cause irritation. The presence of tight foreskin may make it difficult to keep this area clean and can lead to irritation by a foul-smelling substance (smegma) that can accumulate under the foreskin.''Other causes of balanitis may include:''In addition, men with ''diabetes'' are at greater risk for balanitis. Glucose (''sugar'') in the urine that is trapped under the foreskin serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.' Dermatitis/Allergy: Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin, often caused by an irritating substance or a contact allergy. Sensitivity to chemicals in certain products -- such as soaps, detergents, perfumes and spermicides -- can cause an allergic reaction, including irritation, itching, and a rash. Infection: Infection with the yeast candida albicans (thrush) can result in an itchy, spotty rash. Certain sexually transmitted diseases -- including gonorrhea, herpes and syphilis -- can produce symptoms of balanitis."
How Is balanitis treated?,"'Treatment for balanitis depends on the underlying cause. If there is an infection, treatment will include an appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medication. In cases of severe or persistent inflammation, a ''circumcision'' may be recommended.''Taking appropriate hygiene measures can help prevent future bouts of balanitis, such as retracting the foreskin daily and adequately cleaning and drying the head of the penis. In addition, it is important to avoid strong soaps or chemicals, especially those known to cause a skin reaction.' "
What is phimosis?,'Phimosis'' is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is so tight that it cannot be pulled back (retracted) to reveal the head of the penis.' 
What causes phimosis?,"'Phimosis, which is seen most often in children, may be present at birth. It also can be caused by an infection, or by scar tissue that formed as a result of injury or chronic inflammation. Another cause of phimosis is balanitis, which leads to scarring and tightness of the foreskin. Immediate medical attention is necessary if the condition makes urination difficult or impossible.' "
How is phimosis treated?,"'Treatment of phimosis may include gentle, manual stretching of the foreskin over a period of time. Sometimes, the foreskin can be loosened with medication applied to the penis. Circumcision, the surgical removal of the foreskin, often is used to treat phimosis. Another surgical procedure, called preputioplasty, involves separating the foreskin from the glans (head of the penis). This procedure preserves the foreskin and is less traumatic than circumcision.' "
What is paraphimosis?,"'Paraphimosis occurs when the foreskin, once retracted, cannot return to its original location. It is a medical emergency that can cause serious complications if not treated.' "
What causes paraphimosis?,"'Paraphimosis may occur after an erection or sexual activity, or as the result of injury to the head of the penis. With paraphimosis, the foreskin becomes stuck behind the ridge of the head of the penis. If this condition is prolonged, it can cause pain and swelling, and impair blood flow to the penis. In extreme cases, the lack of blood flow can result in the death of tissue (''gangrene''), and amputation of the penis may be necessary.' "
How is paraphimosis treated?,"'Treatment of paraphimosis focuses on reducing the swelling of the glans and foreskin. Applying ice may help reduce swelling, as may applying pressure to the glans to force out blood and fluid. If these measures fail to reduce swelling and allow the foreskin to return to its normal position, an injection of medication to help drain the penis may be necessary. In severe cases, a surgeon may make small ''cuts'' in the foreskin to release it. Circumcision also may be used as a treatment for paraphimosis.' "
What is penile cancer?,'Penile ''cancer'' is a rare form of ''cancer'' that occurs when abnormal cells in the penis divide and grow uncontrolled. Certain benign (non-cancerous) tumors may progress and become ''cancer''.' 
What causes penile cancer?,"""The exact cause of penile cancer is not known, but there are certain risk factors for the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. The risk factors for ""'cancer of the penis'' may include the following:' Uncircumcision: Men who are not circumcised at birth have a higher risk for getting cancer of the penis. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection: HPV includes more than 100 types of viruses that can cause warts (papillomas). Certain types of HPV can infect the reproductive organs and the anal area. These types of HPV are passed from one person to another during sexual contact. Smoking: Smoking exposes the body to many cancer-causing chemicals that affect more than the lungs. Smegma: Oily secretions from the skin can accumulate under the foreskin of the penis. The result is a thick, bad-smelling substance called smegma. If the penis is not cleaned thoroughly, the presence of smegma can cause irritation and inflammation. Phimosis: This is a condition in which the foreskin becomes constricted and difficult to retract. Treatment for psoriasis: The skin disease psoriasis is sometimes treated with a combination of medication and exposure to ultraviolet light, which may increase a person's risk for penile cancer. Age: Over half of penile cancer occur in men over age 68."
What are the symptoms of penile cancer?,"'Symptoms of penile cancer include growths or sores on the penis, abnormal discharge from the penis, and bleeding.' "
What treatments are given for penile cancer?,"'Surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for penile cancer. A doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations:''Radiation'', which uses high-energy rays to attack cancer, and ''chemotherapy'', which uses ''drugs'' to kill cancer, are other treatment options.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Urological Institute.''Reviewed by Daniel Perlman, MD on September 24, 2007''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' Wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side. Electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette (thin, long instrument with a scraping edge) and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells. Cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells. Microsurgery (Moh's surgery) is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible. During this surgery, the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed. Laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells. Circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin. Amputation of the penis (penectomy) is an operation that removes the penis. It is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis. In a partial penectomy, part of the penis is removed. In a total penectomy, the whole penis is removed. Lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery."
How Do Vacuum Constriction Devices Work?,"'To use a vacuum constriction device:''Intercourse can be attempted with the constriction band in place to helpmaintain the erection. The band can be left on safely for up to 30 minutes toallow for successful intercourse.''Be sure that devices brought without a prescription contains a ""quick release"" feature, as there have been reports of penile injuries due to devices that did not release its vacuum on-demand or released it too slowly.' Place the pump, which can be pumped by hand or run on batteries, over the penis. Pump the air out of the cylinder so that a vacuum is created. The vacuum draws blood into the shaft of the penis and causes it to swell and become erect. Once the penis is erect, with the help of lubricant, slide the retaining band down onto the lower end of the penis. Remove the pump after releasing the vacuum."
How Well Do Vacuum Constriction Devices Work?,"'Studies suggest that about 50%-80% of men are satisfied with the results ofVCDs. As with any other method of treatment for ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED''),satisfaction rates may decrease with time.' "
"Who Should Consider Using a Vacuum Constriction 
Device?","'Vacuum constriction devices are safe and can be used by patients with ''ED''caused by many conditions, including:''Vacuum constriction devices should not be used by men who may have asignificant congenital ''bleeding disorder'' or a disorder that predisposes them toa condition called ''priapism'' (a prolonged, sometime painful erection lastingover several hours). Examples include ''sickle cell anemia'', some forms of ''leukemia'', and other blood conditions.' Poor blood flow to the penis Diabetes Surgery for prostate or colon cancer Psychological issues such as anxiety or depression"
What Are the Side Effects of Vacuum Constriction Devices?,"'An erection obtained by the vacuum constriction device is not the same as anerection achieved naturally. The penis tends to be purplish in color and can be''cold'' or numb. Other side effects can include:' A black and blue mark or small area of 
bruising on the shaft of the penis.
This is usually painless and generally will resolve in a few days. Decrease in the force of the ejaculation. The constriction band traps the
ejaculate or semen at the time of orgasm. This is not dangerous and usually
does not cause pain. The semen will usually dribble out once the constriction
band is removed. Generally, this does not interfere with the pleasure of a
climax or orgasm."
How Much Does a Vacuum Constriction Device Cost?,"'Vacuum constriction devices vary in cost from $300 to $500, depending on thebrand and type. The battery-powered versions tend to be more expensive, butalso tend to work a little more quickly. Battery-powered devices are especiallyhelpful for men who do not have good hand strength or coordination or who have ''arthritis''.''There are several devices currently on the market that work effectively.Some of these devices can be obtained without a prescription.' "
Does Insurance Cover Vacuum Constriction Devices?,"'Most insurance policies, including Medicare, cover at least part of thecosts of a vacuum constriction device, especially if a medical cause for ''ED'' hasbeen documented. Medicaid, however, does not cover the device except under extreme circumstances in certain states.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is a peptic ulcer?,"'A peptic ulcer (stomach or duodenal) is a break in the inner lining of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. A peptic ulcer of the stomach is called a gastric ulcer; of the duodenum, a duodenal ulcer; and of the esophagus, an esophageal ulcer. Peptic ulcers occur when the lining these organs is eroded by the acidic digestive (peptic) juices that the cells of the lining secrete of the stomach secrete. A peptic ulcer differs from an erosion because it extends deeper into the lining and incites more of an inflammatory reaction from the tissues that are involved, occasionally with scaring. Peptic ulcer also is referred to as peptic ulcer disease.''Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting millions of Americans yearly. Moreover, peptic ulcers are a recurrent problem; even healed ulcers can recur unless treatment is directed at preventing their recurrence. The medical cost of treating peptic ulcer and its complications runs into billions of dollars annually. Recent medical advances have increased our understanding of ulcer formation. Improved and expanded treatment options now are available.' "
Are peptic ulcers painful?,'The pain of ulcer disease correlates poorly with the presence or severity of active ulceration. Some individuals have persistent pain even after an ulcer is almost completely healed by medication. Others experience no pain at all. Ulcers often come and go spontaneously without the individual ever knowing that they are present unless a serious complication (like bleeding or perforation) occurs.' 
What are the early signs and symptoms of peptic ulcers?,"'Symptoms and signs of\xa0peptic (esophageal, duodenal, or stomach) ulcers disease vary. Some people with stomach ulcers do not have any symptoms or signs while others may have a few or several.''The most common symptom\xa0of a peptic ulcer is a dull or burning pain in the stomach. The pain may be felt anywhere between your ''belly button'' and breastbone. Pain from a peptic or stomach ulcer;''Peptic ulcer other symptoms and signs that are less common include;''Even if your symptoms are mild, you may have a peptic ulcer. You should see your doctor to talk about your symptoms. Without treatment, your peptic ulcer can get worse.'   usually happens when your stomach is empty, for example, such as between meals or during the night; may stop briefly if you eat or take antacids; may last for minutes to hours; may come and go for several days, weeks, or months bloating, burping, feeling sick to your stomach, poor appetite, vomiting, and weight loss."
What causes peptic ulcers?,"'For many years, excess acid was believed to be the major cause of ulcer disease. Accordingly, the emphasis of treatment was on neutralizing and inhibiting the secretion of stomach acid. While acid is still considered necessary for the formation of ulcers and its suppression is still the primary treatment, the two most important initiating causes of ulcers are infection of the stomach by a bacterium named ""''Helicobacter pylori''"" (''H. pylori'') and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or NSAIDs, including ''aspirin''. ''Cigarette smoking'' also is an important cause of ulcers as well as failure of ulcer healing.''Infection with ''H. pylori'' is very common, affecting more than a billion people worldwide. It is estimated that half of the United States population older than age 60 has been infected with ''H. pylori''. Infection usually persists for many years, leading to ulcer disease in 10% to 15% of those infected. In the past, ''H. pylori'' was found in more than 80% of patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers. With increasing appreciation, diagnosis and treatment of this infection, the prevalence of infection with ''H. pylori'' as well as the proportion of ulcers caused by the bacterium has decreased. It is estimated that currently only 20% of ulcers are associated with the bacterium. While the mechanism by which ''H. pylori'' causes ulcers is complex, elimination of the bacterium by antibiotics has clearly been shown to heal ulcers and prevent their recurrence.''NSAIDs are medications used for the treatment of ''arthritis'' and other painful inflammatory conditions in the body. Aspirin, ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'', ''Naprosyn''), and ''etodolac'' (Lodine) are a few examples of this class of medications. Prostaglandins are substances produced by the body, which are important in helping the linings of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to resist damage by the acidic digestive juices of the stomach. NSAIDs cause ulcers by interfering with the production of prostaglandins in the stomach.''Cigarette smoking'' not only causes ulcers, but it also increases the risk of complications from ulcers such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. ''Cigarette smoking'' also is a leading cause of failure of treatment for ulcers.''Contrary to popular belief, ''alcohol'', coffee, colas, spicy foods, and ''caffeine'' have no proven role in ulcer formation. Similarly, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that life stresses or personality types contribute to ulcer disease.'  "
What procedures and tests diagnose peptic ulcers?,"'The diagnosis of an ulcer is made by either a barium upper gastrointestinal X-ray (upper GI series) or an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (''EGD'' or ''esophagogastroduodenoscopy''). The barium upper gastrointestinal (GI) X-ray is easy to perform and involves no risk (other than exposure to ''radiation'') or discomfort. Barium is a chalky substance that is swallowed. It is visible on X- rays\xa0and allows the outline of the stomach to be seen on ''X-rays''; however, barium X-rays are less accurate and may miss ulcers up to 20% of the time.''An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is more accurate than X-rays, but usually involves sedation of the patient and the insertion of a flexible tube through the mouth to inspect the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. ''Upper endoscopy'' has the added advantage of having the capability of removing small tissue samples (biopsies) to test for ''H. pylori'' infection. Biopsies are also examined under a microscope to exclude a cancerous ulcer. While virtually all duodenal ulcers are benign, gastric ulcers can occasionally be cancerous. Therefore, biopsies often are performed on gastric ulcers to exclude ''cancer''.' "
Is there a diet for peptic ulcers? Can you drink alcohol?,"'There is no conclusive evidence that dietary restrictions and bland diets play a role in ulcer healing. No proven relationship exists between peptic ulcer disease and the intake of coffee and alcohol. However, since coffee stimulates gastric acid secretion, and alcohol can cause ''gastritis'', moderation in alcohol and coffee consumption is recommended.' "
What is the treatment for peptic ulcers?,"'The goal of ulcer treatment is to relieve pain, heal the ulcer, and prevent complications. The first step in treatment involves the reduction of risk factors (NSAIDs and cigarettes). The next step is medications.''Many people harbor ''H. pylori ''in their stomachs without ever having pain or ulcers. It is not completely clear whether these patients should be treated with antibiotics. More studies are needed to answer this question.''Eradication of ''H. pylori'' prevents the return of ulcers (a major problem with all other ulcer treatment options). Elimination of this bacteria also may decrease the risk of developing ''gastric cancer'' in the future.''Treatment with antibiotics carries the risk of ''allergic'' reactions, ''diarrhea'', and sometimes severe antibiotic-induced ''colitis'' (inflammation of the colon).'   Patients with documented ulcer disease and H. pylori infection should be treated for both the ulcer and the H. pylori. H. pylori can be very difficult to completely eradicate. Treatment for peptic ulcers requires a combination of several antibiotics, sometimes in combination with a proton-pump inhibitor, H2 blockers, or Pepto-Bismol. Commonly used antibiotics are;tetracycline,amoxicillin,metronidazole (Flagyl),clarithromycin (Biaxin), andlevofloxacin (Levaquin). tetracycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole (Flagyl), clarithromycin (Biaxin), and levofloxacin (Levaquin)."
Antacids and H2 blockers,"'Antacids neutralize existing acid in the stomach. Antacids such as ''Maalox'', ''Mylanta'', and ''Amphojel'' are safe and effective treatments. However, the neutralizing action of these agents is short-lived, and frequent dosing is required. Magnesium containing antacids, such as Maalox and Mylanta, can cause ''diarrhea'', while aluminum containing agents like Amphojel can cause ''constipation''. Ulcers frequently return when antacids are discontinued.''Studies have shown that a protein released in the stomach called histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion. Histamine antagonists (H2 blockers) are drugs designed to block the action of histamine on gastric cells and reduce the production of acid. Examples of H2 blockers are ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''), ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''), ''nizatidine'' (''Axid''), and ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''). While H2 blockers are effective in ulcer healing, they have a limited role in eradicating H. pylori without antibiotics. Therefore, ulcers frequently return when H2 blockers are stopped.''Generally, H2 blockers are well tolerated and have few side effects even with long-term use. In rare instances, patients report ''headache'', ''confusion'', lethargy, or ''hallucinations''. Chronic use of cimetidine may rarely cause ''impotence'' or ''breast swelling'"". Both cimetidine and ranitidine can interfere with the body's ability to handle alcohol. Patients on these drugs who drink alcohol may have elevated blood alcohol levels. These drugs also may interfere with the ""'liver'""'s handling of other medications like ""'phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), ''warfarin'' (''Jantoven'', ''Coumadin''), and ''theophylline''. Frequent monitoring and adjustments of the dosages of these medications may be needed.' "
"Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), Carafate, and Cytotec","'Proton-pump inhibitors such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), ''pantoprazole'' (''Protonix''), ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), and ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex'') are more potent than H2 blockers in suppressing acid secretion. The different proton-pump inhibitors are very similar in action and there is no evidence that one is more effective than the other in healing ulcers. While proton-pump inhibitors are comparable to H2 blockers in effectiveness in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, they are superior to H2 blockers in treating esophageal ulcers. Esophageal ulcers are more sensitive than gastric and duodenal ulcers to minute amounts of acid. Therefore, more complete acid suppression accomplished by proton-pump inhibitors is important for esophageal ulcer healing.''Proton-pump inhibitors are well tolerated. Side effects are uncommon; they include ''headache'', ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', ''nausea'' and ''rash'"". Interestingly, proton-pump inhibitors do not have any effect on a person's ability to digest and absorb nutrients. Proton-pump inhibitors have also been found to be safe when used long term, without serious adverse health effects. Although they may promote loss of bone (""'osteoporosis'') and low magnesium levels, both\xa0side effects are easily identified and treated.''Sucralfate'' (''Carafate'') and ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec'') are agents that strengthen the gut lining against attacks by acidic digestive juices. Sucralfate coats the ulcer surface and promotes healing. Sucralfate has very few side effects. The most common side effect is ''constipation'' and the interference with the absorption of other medications. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin-like substance commonly used to counteract the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. Studies suggest that misoprostol may protect the stomach from ulceration among people who take NSAIDs chronically. Diarrhea is a common side effect. Misoprostol can cause miscarriages when given to ''pregnant'' women\xa0and should be avoided by women of childbearing age.' "
What are the complications of peptic ulcers?,"'With modern treatment, people with ulcer disease can lead normal lives without lifestyle changes or dietary restrictions. ''Cigarette'' ''smokers'' have been found to have more complications from ulcers and treatment failure.''Eradication of the bacteria ''H. pylori ''not only heals ulcers but also prevents the recurrence of ulcer disease.''Patients with ulcers generally function quite comfortably.''Some ulcers probably heal even without medications (though they probably recur as well). Therefore, the major problems resulting from ulcers are related to ulcer complications. Complications include;''Patients with bleeding ulcers may report;''Patients with persistent or severe bleeding may require blood transfusions. An endoscopy is performed to establish the site of bleeding and to stop active ulcer bleeding with the aid of specialized endoscopic instruments.''Perforation ''through the stomach leads to the leakage of stomach contents into the abdominal (peritoneal) ''cavity'', resulting in acute ''peritonitis'' (infection of the abdominal ''cavity''). These patients report a sudden onset of extreme ''abdominal pain'', which is worsened by any type of motion. Abdominal muscles become rigid and board-like. ''Urgent surgery usually is required.'' A duodenal ulcer that has perforated can burrow into adjacent organs such as the pancreas or behind the abdomen and into the back. An esophageal ulcer that perforates can cause severe inflammation of the tissues that surround it (mediastinitis).''Duodenum -\xa0''A\xa0peptic ulcer that forms in the narrow outlet from the stomach, it can obstruct the flow of stomach contents into the duodenum. Duodenal ulcers sometimes also may obstruct the flow of intestinal contents.\xa0''Patients with obstruction often report;''The obstruction usually occurs at or near the pylorus of the stomach. Endoscopy is useful in establishing the diagnosis of obstruction from an ulcer and excluding gastric ''cancer'' as the cause of the obstruction. In some patients, gastric obstruction can be relieved by suction of the stomach contents with a tube for 72 hours, along with intravenous anti-ulcer medications, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) and ranitidine (Zantac).''Patients with persistent obstruction require surgery.'   bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of emptying of the passage of food. passage of black tarry stools (melena), weakness, a sense of light-headedness or ay even pass out upon standing (orthostatic hypotension or syncope), and vomiting blood (hematemesis).

What is the prognosis for a person with peptic ulcer disease? Can it be cured?,"'With modern treatment, people with ulcer disease can lead normal lives without lifestyle changes or dietary restrictions. Cigarette smokers have been found to have more complications from ulcers and treatment failure. Eradication of the bacteria ''H. pylori'' not only heals ulcers but also prevents the recurrence of ulcer disease.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat peptic ulcers?,"'Doctors who commonly treat peptic ulcer disease include primary care providers, such as general medicine physicians, family medicine doctors, and internists. Specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of peptic ulcer disease are gastroenterologists.' "
What is peptic ulcer disease?,"'Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the inner lining of your\xa0stomach\xa0and the upper portion of your small bowel (duodenum).''There are\xa0 two types of ulcers, stomach ulcers and duodenal ulcers.''A ''peptic ulcer'' can give you belly ''pain'' or sometimes bleeding or it may make a hole in your stomach or bowel.'

A medicine that has bismuth to coat the ulcer, so it heals well. A medicine to reduce stomach acid such as a proton pump inhibitor and an antacid. A probiotic to increase good bacteria in your gut. An alternative painkiller such as paracetamol and advise you to stop all the painkillers, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs you may be taking."
What to expect and how to prevent the disease,"'Wash your hands thoroughly before meals to prevent the spread of H. pylori infections.' You should drink water from a safe and clean source. There is no vaccination currently available for an H. pylori infection. Complete the antibiotic course advised by your doctor as directed to avoid any antibiotic resistance and recurrence of the symptoms. Medications are taken for one to two weeks, which can usually cure ulcers. If you have ulcers not caused by H. pylori, stop using analgesics or painkillers and your doctor will start you on medicines to reduce stomach acid levels. If the ulcer fails to heal (rarely), you may need surgery. You should stop smoking, drinking alcohol and consuming spicy food to reduce the risk of future ulcers. If a child is suffering, they may require extensive diagnostic workup for their symptoms."
What are the complications of peptic ulcer disease?, Bleeding from your stomach or small bowel Stomach or gut obstruction Hole in your stomach or small bowel
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
What is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure for placing a tube for feeding without having to perform an open operation on the abdomen (laparotomy). It is used in patients who will be unable to take in food by mouth for a prolonged period of time. A gastrostomy, or surgical opening into the stomach, is made through the skin using an a flexible, lighted instrument (endoscope) passed orally into the stomach to assist with the placement of the tube and secure it in place.' "
What is the purpose of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'The purpose of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is to feed those patients who cannot swallow food. Irrespective of the age of the patient or their medical condition, the purpose of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is to provide fluids and ''nutrition'' directly into the stomach.' "
Who does percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is done by a physician. The physician may be a general surgeon, an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), radiologist, or a ''gastroenterologist'' (gastrointestinal specialist).' "
Where is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy done (PEG)?,'PEG is performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility. It is not necessary to perform a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in an operating room.' 
How is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) performed?,"'Local anesthesia (usually ''lidocaine'' or another spray) is used to anesthetize the throat. An endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera and a light on the end) is passed through the mouth, throat and ''esophagus'' into the stomach. The physician then makes a small incision (cut) in the skin of the abdomen over the stomach and pushes a needle through the skin and into the stomach. The tube for feeding then is pushed through the needle and into the stomach. The tube then is sutured (tied) in place to the skin.' "
When can the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy patient go home (PEG)?,"'The patient usually can go home the same day or the next morning, unless they are in the hospital for other reasons.' "
What are the possible complications with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)?,"'Possible complications include infection of the puncture site (as in any kind of surgery,) dislodgement of the tube with leakage of the ''liquid diet'' that is fed through the tube into the abdomen, and clogging of the tube.' "
What are the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy?,"'Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy takes less time, carries less risk and costs less than a surgical gastrostomy which requires opening the abdomen. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is commonly performed, so there are many physicians with experience in performing the procedure. When feasible, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is preferable to a surgical gastrostomy.' "
How is percutaneous alcohol injection done and how does it work?,"'In this technique, sterile, 100% ''alcohol'' is injected into cancerous growths, or tumors, in the ''liver''\xa0to kill ''cancer'' cells. This has worked best against growths comprised of hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' or primary ''liver cancer'', but has been tried as well against liver metastases from other types of ''cancer'' arising elsewhere (secondary ''cancers''). The alcohol is injected through the skin (percutaneously) into the ''tumor'' using a very thin needle with the help of ''ultrasound'' or CT visual guidance. Alcohol causes tumor destruction by drawing water out of tumor cells (dehydrating them) and thereby altering (denaturing) the structure of cellular proteins. It may take up to five or six sessions of injections to completely destroy the ''cancer''.' "
Which patients are treated with percutaneous alcohol injection?,"'The ideal patient for alcohol injection has fewer than three Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) tumors, each of which is:''Additionally, patients with HCC undergoing alcohol injection should have no signs of chronic liver failure, such as free fluid build-up around the liver or in the abdominal ''cavity'' (''ascites'') or ''jaundice''. (Patients with severe liver damage and little remaining normal ''liver function'' are said to be in liver failure, and would not be able to tolerate the alcohol injections.)'  well defined (distinct margins) less than 3cm in diameter surrounded by a shell consisting of scar tissue (fibrous encapsulation) not near the surface of the liver"
What are the side effects of percutaneous alcohol injection?,"'The most common side effect of alcohol injection is leakage of alcohol onto the surface of the liver and into the abdominal ''cavity'', thereby causing ''pain'' and ''fever''. It is important that the location of the tumor relative to the adjacent blood vessels and bile ducts is clearly identified. The reason for needing to locate these structures is to avoid injuring them during the procedure and causing bleeding, bile duct inflammation, or bile leakage.' "
How dangerous is percutaneous heart valve replacement surgery?,'A percutaneous valve replacement is a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased ''heart'' valve. The native valve is replaced with an artificial valve sewn into a ''stent''. The valve may be made of animal tissue or human tissue from the heart’s protective membrane (pericardium).\xa0''Percutaneous valve repair is widely performed and carries the typical surgical risks of a cardiac procedure. Percutaneous ''heart valve replacement'' techniques are still evolving. The associated risks are expected to decline with advancements in this field.''Percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement has a reasonably good outcome since it is performed primarily on young patients with congenital ''heart disease''.''Percutaneous ''aortic valve'' replacement carries higher risks and the procedure is performed only when open surgery is not feasible. The patients are primarily those who are elderly with already compromised health and have associated risks including:' Emergency nature of the procedure Congestive heart failure Left ventricular dysfunction Coronary disease Previous surgeries Other coexisting conditions (comorbidities)
How is percutaneous valve replacement performed?,"'Percutaneous valve replacement procedure is performed in a ''cardiac catheterization'' laboratory. A specially trained interventional cardiovascular physician performs the procedure. The physician may use general anesthesia or local anesthesia with mild sedation, depending on the patient’s condition and the complexity of the procedure.''A flexible tube (catheter) is used to carry and deploy the valve. The catheter may be inserted through the ribs into the apex of the heart (transapical), an artery in the wrist (transradial), neck (transjugular), or the groin (transfemoral). The cardiologist uses ultrasonagraphy and continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) images for guidance. The procedure may take up to four hours depending on how many valves are replaced.''In preparation for the procedure, the patient must''The patient undergoes''The anesthesiologist''The cardiovascular physician' Avoid eating or drinking for eight hours prior to the procedure Inform the doctor of any allergies Inform the doctor if they are pregnant Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications Complete blood tests that include coagulation parameters Cardiac radiography tests such as Chest X-ray echocardiography electrocardiography Administers painkillers and sedation through an IV line in case of local anesthesia Intubates the patient to provide oxygen, in the case of general anesthesia May attach external defibrillator pads Inserts a urinary catheter Connects the patient to the electrocardiogram to monitor the heart’s electrical impulse Monitors the patient’s vital functions includingheart rateblood pressureoxygen levels heart rate blood pressure oxygen levels Injects a local anesthetic in the site chosen for catheter insertion. Makes a tiny incision in the skin, punctures the blood vessel and inserts the catheter using a guidewire. Gently advances the catheter through the artery towards the heart, using ultrasound images for guidance. In the case of transapical approach, the surgeon inserts the catheter directly into the ventricle through the space between the ribs (intercostal space) to reach the heart valve. Injects a dye to scan the blood vessels through fluoroscopy. Deploys the replacement valve in position and inflates it with a balloon to fit tightly in place. Ensures that the valve is in position and functioning properly. Withdraws the catheter gently. Arrests bleeding from the insertion site and bandages it. Post-procedure, the patient is monitored for several hours until stable."
How long does it take to recover from percutaneous valve replacement?,"'Percutaneous valve replacement patients may need hospitalization for a week. Most people resume light activities in a week.\xa0 However, they must avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities. Complete recovery may take up to three months.''Patients must have regular checkups to assess cardiovascular health. Most people need to make permanent changes in lifestyle and food habits.' "
What is the life expectancy after aortic valve replacement?,'The life expectancy depends on the patient’s age and severity of the condition. Average life expectancy of a 60-year-old after aortic valve replacement is approximately 12 years.' 
What are the risks and complications of a percutaneous valve replacement?,'Complications of percutaneous valve replacement include' Hemorrhage Severe fluid collection in the pericardium (cardiac tamponade) Cardiac arrest Heart attack or failure Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Blood clot and stroke Improper valve functioning Valve slipping out of place Allergic reaction to medications or dye material Injury toheartlungblood vesselsnerveslymphatic duct heart lung blood vessels nerves lymphatic duct Bleeding and infection at the catheter insertion site Infection and sepsis Kidney disease Death
What is a Liver Biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This is performed as an office or outpatient procedure or during surgery. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of:' Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes). Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice). A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan. Unexplained enlargement of the liver."
Is Liver Biopsy Safe?,"'In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely ''internal bleeding'' may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder.' "
How Do I Prepare for a Liver Biopsy?,"'When preparing for a liver biopsy, there are several things to keep in mind.''Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor.' Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, Plavix, or Persantine. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor."
What Happens on the Day of a Liver Biopsy?,"'Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a ''platelet count'"", and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot.""'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor cleans and numbs an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor then makes a small incision on your upper abdomen and inserts a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may takeacetaminophen (Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure."
What other methods of liver biopsy are available?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous.''During a laparoscopic biopsy'', a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the physician watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver.'' A transvenous biopsy'' may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.' "
Warning About Liver Biopsy,"'If you have a ''fever''; difficulty ''breathing''; ''chills''; ''dizziness''; or tenderness or severe pain at the site of a liver biopsy or in the chest, shoulder, or abdomen within 72 hours after the procedure, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.' "
What Is Percutaneous Needle Technique Musculoskeletal Biopsy?,"'Percutaneous needle technique musculoskeletal biopsy is a procedure to obtain a small piece of tissue (biopsy) from the muscles and/or the bones. It is performed by passing a special type of needle through the skin (percutaneously) under image guidance (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scan, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' [''MRI'']). The procedure provides an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for helping doctors diagnose ''cancers'' and noncancer conditions.\xa0''Percutaneous needle technique biopsy can lead to a rapid and accurate diagnosis\xa0if a medical condition cannot be diagnosed accurately by physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory values. Most percutaneous needle technique musculoskeletal biopsies can be performed using local anesthesia, with an addition of light sedation if needed. Various imaging techniques, such as CT, fluoroscopy,\xa0''ultrasonography'' (USG), and MRI, can be used to target the lesion. The procedure is safe and major complications are rarely observed.\xa0' "
What happens during a percutaneous needle technique musculoskeletal biopsy?,"'Before the procedure, your doctor may:''During the procedure:' Order some blood tests and imaging studies (e.g., X-ray, ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI). Ask you about any chronic health conditions you may have. Ask you about any medications you are on. Ask about any allergies you may have. Explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications, and address your doubts and concerns related to the procedure. Obtain your written consent. Ask you to not eat or drink anything for a few hours before the procedure. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will be comfortably positioned on the operating table/bed depending on the site of biopsy. The doctor administers local/regional anesthesia. General anesthesia may be required for procedures that are expected to be lengthy, complicated, or painful and if you are severely anxious or frightened. You may be given intravenous drugs to keep you sedated and comfortable during the procedure. The doctor will clean the area from where the biopsy is to be done. They will insert a specialized needle through the skin under image guidance (USG/CT/MRI/fluoroscopy). Once the needle reaches the desired site, a small piece of tissue (biopsy) is collected. The dressing is done. The biopsy sample is sent for examination by a pathologist and examined under a microscope. You may be asked to lie in a particular position for some time to avoid pressure at the biopsy site The doctor or nurse will regularly record your vitals and look for any complications."
Is percutaneous needle technique musculoskeletal biopsy safe?,'The percutaneous needle technique musculoskeletal biopsy is a safe procedure with low chances of complications. The risk largely depends on the type of needle selected and the site of the biopsy. The reported incidence of complications is in the range of 0-10% with significant complications’ risk being less than 1%.''The complications may include:' Bleeding Infections Nerve injury Pneumothorax (entrapment of air in the chest) Fracture Tumor seeding or spillage along the biopsy needle track
What is percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography?,'Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is a minimally invasive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure to evaluate and treat obstruction in the biliary tract. The biliary tract is the drainage system for the ''liver'' and gallbladder.''The procedure involves injection of a contrast dye into the bile duct to produce an image of the biliary tract using continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) to guide the surgeon. An ultra-sonar scan may also be used for the procedure. A catheter may be introduced through the same path if bile drainage is required.' 
Why is percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography performed?,"'Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is usually performed when noninvasive diagnostic procedures such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') are not feasible.''Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is performed to find out the cause and location of biliary obstruction. The procedure is usually a preliminary step in treatment of biliary diseases.''The biliary tract, also known as the biliary system or biliary tree, consists of the liver, gallbladder and a network of drainage ducts. The biliary tract produces, stores and releases bile into the beginning portion of the intestine (duodenum). Bile fluid aids in ''digestion'' of ''fats'' and fat-soluble ''vitamins''. Bile also carries the waste processed by the liver, to the duodenum to be excreted.''The liver produces bile, 50% of which is stored in the gallbladder. The hepatic ducts from the liver and the cystic duct from the gallbladder join to form the common bile duct that carries the bile to the duodenum. If the bile flow is obstructed in any part of the biliary system, it leads to ''jaundice'' and associated complications.''Causes of bile duct obstruction include''Purely diagnostic percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is uncommon, the procedure usually also includes placement of a catheter for draining the bile fluid.\xa0' Bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) Gallstones (cholelithiasis) Bile duct strictures Inflammation and scarring of bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) Inflammation of the biliary system Inflammation of pancreas (pancreatitis) Systemic infections Benign tumors Abnormal tissue growth Cancer of  pancreas bile duct liver gallbladder secondary cancer due to other cancers (metastasis)"
How is percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography done?,"'Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is usually performed by an interventional radiologist in the radiology lab. The procedure may take up to an hour, and is performed using local anesthesia and mild sedation. Some people may require a nerve block with an epidural injection, or rarely, general anesthesia.''Prior to procedure, the patient\xa0''The interventional radiologist' Undergoes imaging tests, and blood tests to check coagulation parameters and liver function.

Administers painkillers and mild sedation through an IV line. Administers local anesthesia at the site chosen for needle insertion. Monitors the patient’s heart rate and blood pressure during the procedure. Inserts the needle through the liver (transhepatic) into the bile duct, from the right or middle of the upper abdomen, with ultra-scan and fluoroscopy guidance. Removes bile fluid and tissue for biopsy. Injects the contrast dye into the bile duct. Records X-ray films in the fluoroscope as the contrast dye spreads and reveals the biliary system by turning it opaque. Withdraws the needle if no intervention is required. Places a catheter for bile drainage, if required. The patient will be able to leave shortly after the procedure or the next day, depending on the type of anesthesia used. The patient may experience some amount of post-procedure pain that can be resolved with painkillers. Further treatment will depend on examining the fluoroscopic films."
What are the risks and complications of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography?,"'Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is generally a low-risk procedure. Potential complications include:' Allergic reaction to the dye material Hemorrhage Infection Inflammation of the abdominal lining (peritonitis) Bile leakage Bile duct inflammation Injury to the liver Injury to the gallbladder Bowel perforation Puncture of the lung (pneumothorax), very rarely Sepsis"
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
What is percutaneous valve replacement procedure?,"'A percutaneous valve replacement is a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased ''heart'' valve. The malfunctioning valve is removed and replaced with a manufactured valve, which may be mechanical. Other valve replacements may be crafted from animal tissue, or human tissue harvested from the patient’s own membrane enveloping the heart (pericardium).''A flexible tube (catheter) carries the valve to the heart through blood vessels, and then deploys the valve in place. The catheter may be inserted\xa0''The cardiologist uses ''ultrasonography'' and continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) images for guidance.' through the ribs into the apex of the heart (transapical),  an artery in the wrist (transradial),  neck (transjugular), or the  groin (transfemoral). "
Developments in percutaneous heart valve replacement,"'Percutaneous repair and replacement of heart valves is currently a developing field. While repair and balloon dilation of heart valves (valvuloplasty) are being performed extensively now, many of the valve replacement devices and techniques are still in developmental stages.''Currently, percutaneous valve replacement is performed only on patients who are at high risk for ''open heart surgery''. Studies are ongoing to make it available as a less-invasive option to low-risk patients.''The heart has four valves that regulate the blood flow:''Current stages of development in percutaneous replacement of the four heart valves are as follows:''Percutaneous aortic valve replacement/implantation (PAVR/PAVI) also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement/implantation (TAVR/TAVI) is a well-established treatment under certain conditions. ''Balloon valvuloplasty'' is widely performed as a temporary treatment for aortic calve narrowing (stenosis).''Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is widely performed to dilate the mitral valve, but other procedures are in testing and clinical trial phases. Percutaneous mitral valve repair has been performed only in ''clinical trials'', while percutaneous replacement is yet to be performed on humans.''Clinical experience in percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement is the largest among all percutaneous valve replacements. Pulmonary valve replacement is performed primarily for congenital ''heart disease''.''At present percutaneous tricuspid valve repair procedure is under clinical trials and valve replacement is in early stages of development.' Aortic valve between the left ventricle and aorta Mitral valve separating left atrium and left ventricle Pulmonary valve between right ventricle and pulmonary artery Tricuspid valve separating right atrium and right ventricle"
Why is percutaneous valve replacement performed?,"'Percutaneous procedure is a minimally invasive procedure for patients with serious ''heart valve disease'' who are elderly or those with significant other coexisting conditions (comorbidities) that preclude open surgery.''Currently, only aortic and pulmonary valve replacements are performed percutaneously. Only valve repairs and dilatation are percutaneously performed in the mitral and tricuspid valves.''Percutaneous valve replacement is performed to treat the following conditions:' Backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle (aortic regurgitation) due toDeterioration of the valveBacterial infection (endocarditis)Obstruction of blood flow due to aortic valve stenosis Deterioration of the valve Bacterial infection (endocarditis) Obstruction of blood flow due to aortic valve stenosis Congenital heart disease with malformed aortic valve that leads to regurgitation or obstruction Pulmonary hypertension and dysfunctional pulmonary valve that results in pulmonary regurgitation"
What is pericarditis?,"'The heart muscle has a tight covering that surrounds it, a lining sac called the pericardium (peri=around+cardium=heart). This sac actually has two layers. The visceral pericardium is only one cell layer thick and fits tightly onto the heart muscle. The parietal pericardium is much tougher and thicker and has fibers that tether the heart to the rib cage and ''diaphragm''. There is a potential space between the layers, meaning that in normal situations, it has a minimal amount of fluid. However, should inflammation occur, it can fill with fluid. Inflammation of the lining of the heart is called pericarditis (itis=inflammation).'  "
What are the symptoms of pericarditis?,"'Chest pain'' is the most common symptom of pericarditis.''Other symptoms may include ''fevers'' and ''chills'', sweats, ''shortness of breath'', and ''difficulty swallowing''.''When pericarditis is due to infection, the symptoms tend to arise quickly. Inflammation due to chronic diseases is more gradual in onset.'   Classically, the pain begins in the center of the chest and radiates to the neck or upper back. The pain is sharp and stabbing, but may also be felt as a dull ache or burning pain. The intensity may be mild or very severe and it can come on gradually or suddenly. The pain makes it hurt to take a breath. Most individuals feel worse when lying flat."
What causes pericarditis?,"'Pericarditis is usually from unknown causes (idiopathic). The cause may often be viral infections. Causes of pericarditis include:''Infections: ''Inflammatory diseases: ''Diseases that can cause generalized inflammation in other places within the body can also cause inflammation of the pericardium. Some examples include:''Metabolic illnesses:''Heart disease'':''Other causes: '   Viruses Bacteria (like tuberculosis) HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Scleroderma Ankylosing spondylitis Inflammatory bowel disease Kidney failure and uremia Hypothyroidism Heart attack can cause direct irritation and inflammation of the pericardial lining. Dressler's syndrome describes inflammation caused by an immune response to heart tissue damage from heart attack, open heart surgery, or a trauma. Tumors Radiation therapy Medications"
How is pericarditis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of pericarditis begins with the health care professional taking a history about the pain and its character. The health care professional will perform a physical examination and ask the patient about associated symptoms. Past medical history is important, since pericarditis can be a complication of a chronic disease or a side effect of medication.''The most common physical finding that helps confirm the diagnosis of pericarditis is a pericardial friction rub. Inflammation prevents the two layers of pericardium from easily sliding against each other with each heartbeat. The inflammation causes a friction noise that can be heard with a stethoscope when listening to the heart. It is better heard when the patient leans forward, which causes the heart to shift to the front of the chest. The rub may not always be present and may come and go from hour to hour.''The electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) shows electrical activity of the heart. In pericarditis, there are hallmark changes that are seen and can help make the diagnosis. While an abnormal EKG is helpful in making the diagnosis, in the early stages of inflammation, the EKG may be normal. In most cases of uncomplicated pericarditis, a chest X-ray is usually normal. However, if fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, the heart can appear larger on the X-ray.''A sound wave test of the heart (an echocardiogram or ''ultrasound'' of the heart) is very helpful in detecting and quantifying the fluid in pericarditis. The purpose of the test is to detect an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, called an effusion. Although in many mild cases of acute pericarditis, there is no pericardial fluid seen with ''echocardiography''. A variety of blood tests may be ordered depending upon the clinical situation.''Pericardiocentesis (please see below), a procedure using a needle, is used to draw fluid out of the pericardial sac. It may be done to detect bacterial infection. This procedure can also be used to treat dangerous, severe pericarditis called pericardial tamponade.' "
What is the treatment for pericarditis?,"'Most often, pericarditis is caused by a viral infection and the treatment is aimed at decreasing inflammation and controlling pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' or ''NSAIDs'' (ibuprofen [''Motrin'' and others], ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'', ''Naprosyn'', and others]) are commonly used. A short course of narcotic pain medication may be helpful. For other causes of pericarditis, treatment of the underlying cause of pericarditis is essential.''Pericardiocentesis, a procedure where a thin needle is inserted through the chest wall into the pericardial sac, may be considered if a large effusion is present that affects ''heart function'' (see cardiac tamponade below).''Pericardotomy (cutting a hole in the pericardial sac) or pericardectomy (removing the sac completely) may be needed for recurrent pericarditis that causes scarring within the pericardial sac and prevents the heart from beating properly.'  "
What are the complications of pericarditis?,"'If enough fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, it can affect heart function and decrease ''blood pressure''. The fluid can accumulate gradually over time or can gather rapidly, depending on the cause. The increased amount of fluid can cause a rise in pressure within the pericardial sac. This causes two potential problems:''If a disease causes the pericardial effusion to increase in size slowly, symptoms may come on gradually and the heart can adapt. The symptoms may be nonspecific but can include shortness of breath and difficulty with ''exercise'' or doing daily activities. But if the fluid accumulates quickly, like bleeding because of trauma, small amounts of fluid can cause significant problems.''Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency and the patient may be in ''shock'' with ''low blood pressure'', difficulty ''breathing'', and ''congestive heart failure''. The classic findings of cardiac tamponade are:''Testing requires emergent EKG, portable chest X-ray, and echocardiogram. Some hospitals are not staffed 24 hours a day by a cardiologist or with an echocardiogram and the diagnosis is often made clinically.''Cardiac tamponade is a true medical emergency that requires pericardiocentesis, a procedure where a long needle is inserted through the chest wall into the pericardial sac and the fluid is removed. This relieves the pressure within the sac and temporarily resolves the acute emergency. A ''plastic'' tube or catheter may be left in the chest until the underlying illness that caused the tamponade is treated and stabilized.''Recurrent inflammation of the pericardial sac can lead to scarring of the space between the two layers of the pericardial sac. The scarring constricts the movement of the heart during each heartbeat and can prevent the heart from expanding to accept blood returning from the body after each heartbeat. This affects heart function and cardiac output because with less blood returning with each beat, there is less that can be pumped out with the next heartbeat.''Bleeding into the pericardium from trauma or from a heart operation is the most common cause of ''constrictive pericarditis'', but tumors, or infections like ''tuberculosis'' or fungus, can also be the cause.''The constriction occurs slowly over time and will cause shortness of breath on exertion and decreased ability to ''exercise''. Swelling in the legs and the abdomen may exist because it is difficult for blood to return to the heart, and the back pressure in the veins causes fluid to leak out into the tissues.''Diagnosis is made again by history, physical examination, EKG, echocardiography, and sometimes ''computerized tomography'' (CT) of the chest.''If there is significant scarring of the pericardial sac, pericardotomy -- an operation to split open the pericardium to free up the constriction -- may be required to improve function. If the whole pericardium must be stripped away from the heart muscle, the procedure is called a pericardectomy.' The ventricles or lower chambers of the heart responsible for pumping blood to the body have difficulty filling with blood because the fluid in the sac prevents them from filling with blood. That means there is less blood to send to the body with each heartbeat. The increased pressure within the pericardium may decrease the amount of blood that can return to the heart.

What is cauliflower ear?," Cauliflower ear is an acquired deformity of the outer ear. It is usually due to blunt trauma to the ear. When the cartilage of the ear is injured by trauma or inflammation, the blood supply from the skin is disrupted, often forming a large pocket of blood, called a hematoma. As the injury to the ear heals it can shrivel up and fold in on itself and appear pale, giving it a cauliflower-like appearance, hence the term cauliflower ear. Wrestlers, boxers, and martial artists in particular are susceptible to this type of injury, therefore, cauliflower ear is also sometimes called boxer's ear or wrestler's ear. In 2014, UFC fighter Leslie Smith's cauliflower ear exploded after a direct hit from opponent Jessica Eye, causing the fight to stop. The fighter had an existing cauliflower ear that was intermittently being drained of fluid before the fight, but the ear was further damaged by the intense blow, causing it to bleed profusely."
What causes cauliflower ear?,"'The ear is vulnerable to blunt trauma. When the ear is struck and a ''blood clot'' develops under the skin, or the skin is sheared from the cartilage, the connection of the skin to the cartilage is disrupted, causing cauliflower ear. ''The cartilage of the ear has no other blood supply except that supplied by the overlying skin. When the skin is pulled from the cartilage, and/or separated from the cartilage by blood (as with accumulated blood from injury or inflammation, or infection), the cartilage is deprived of important nutrients. Ultimately, the cartilage dies and the risk of infection is increased.''Untreated, the ear cartilage contracts on itself forming a shriveled up outer ear, known as the cauliflower ear deformity. Once cartilage death and scarring (fibrosis) occurs, the resulting deformity is generally permanent. The ear may also appear pale, due to loss of blood supply. In some cases, cosmetic procedures may improve the appearance of the ear. ''Cartilage damage may also result from piercing the upper ear in the cartilage. Piercing can lead to a type of ear cartilage infection called auricular perichondritis, which can result in cauliflower ear.  An even more rare cause of cauliflower ear is from the inflammation of cartilage in relapsing ''polychondritis''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of cauliflower ear?,"'Because cauliflower ear is usually due to trauma, the symptoms depend on the severity of the trauma to the ear.''Common symptoms of acute cauliflower ear''Severe symptoms of cauliflower ear''If the damage from the trauma is severe and medical attention should be sought immediately. Once scarring and deformity of the cartilage occurs, there may be no symptoms.'  Pain Swelling Bruising Deformity of the curvature of the ear Loss of hearing Ringing in the ear (tinnitus) Headaches Blurred vision Facial swelling Severe bleeding"
What is the treatment for cauliflower ear?,"'The goals of treatment are to prevent permanent damage to the cartilage by draining blood from the hematoma, treating any infection, and reducing inflammation in order to re-establish the connection of the skin to the underlying cartilage. Antibiotics are prescribed to prevent infection.''Patients may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat doctor (otolaryngologist) or ''plastic surgeon'' to treat this deformity and assure proper healing.''Cauliflower ear repair consists of draining accumulated blood (the hematoma) through an incision in the ear and applying a compressive dressing to sandwich the two sides of the skin against the cartilage. ' "
What is the prognosis for cauliflower ear?,"'When treated aggressively and promptly, cauliflower ear deformity is unlikely. Any delay in diagnosis leads to more difficulty in managing the problem, increased chances for insufficient blood supply to the ear cartilage, and escalated risk of deformity.' "
Is it possible to prevent cauliflower ear?,'Protective headgear and helmets worn during sporting activities can help prevent this condition. Helmets can also protect from serious ''head injury''.''See a doctor (preferably an otolaryngologist or ''plastic'' surgeon) for definitive care as soon as possible after the injury.' 
What causes pericoronitis?,"'The primary cause for pericoronitis is accumulation of bacteria. Usually, the tooth is only partially exposed (soft tissue impaction) and has excess gum tissue that overlaps the tooth. Bacteria and food debris get trapped in the space between the tooth and the overlapping ''gingiva''. This overlapping gum flap is called an ""operculum."" Initially, inflammation of the operculum (operculitis) takes place. A pericoronal infection can develop by the formation of an abscess under the operculum. If left unattended, the infection can spread to other soft tissue spaces.' "
"What 
are risk factors for pericoronitis?","'Most commonly, pericoronitis affects young adults in their mid-20s who are experiencing poorly erupting ''wisdom teeth'' (third molars). Pericoronitis is essentially a ""wisdom tooth infection."" Risk factors for pericoronitis include the presence of excess gum tissue (operculum) overlying the wisdom tooth and difficult access to the ''wisdom teeth'' for proper cleaning.' "
What are pericoronitis symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of pericoronitis can range from mild to severe and include'   pain, swelling of the gums, tenderness, redness of gum tissue, bad breath (halitosis), bad taste from pus, difficulty opening the jaw (trismus), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), swollen submandibular lymph nodes, fever, loss of appetite, and feeling unwell."
What specialists treat pericoronitis?,"'Any licensed dentist is able to treat pericoronitis. In situations where surgery is required or if it is a severe and complicated case, dental specialists such an ''oral surgeon'' or a periodontist (gum surgeon) can provide treatment. In very rare instances, should the infection become more widespread, emergency services with physician care might be needed.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose pericoronitis?,"'Diagnosis of pericoronitis is based on symptoms and appearance during a clinical evaluation with a health care professional such as a dentist or oral surgeon. A dental X-ray is used to assess the area and rule out other possible causes for pain, such as dental decay. Once all the information from the patient and facts are gathered, the diagnosis of pericoronitis can be made.' "
What is the treatment for pericoronitis?,"'There are three methods for treatment of pericoronitis depending on the severity of the condition:''To manage the pain of acute pericoronitis, use ''over-the-counter'' medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''). If it is localized to the tooth and there has been no spread of the infection, a dentist thoroughly cleans out the area under local anesthesia. A dentist may prescribe an oral rinse containing chlorhexidine to keep the area clean. Otherwise, warm saltwater or diluted hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oral rinse. If there is swelling or fever, a dentist may prescribe oral antibiotics such as ''amoxicillin'' or ''erythromycin''.''When the molar can be useful for chewing and there is a desire to keep the tooth, minor oral surgery can be performed to remove the operculum. This will allow better access to properly clean the area and prevent the accumulation of bacteria and food debris. In some unfortunate instances, the gum tissue may grow back and create the same problem.''Removal (extraction) of the tooth is the most common treatment method since wisdom ''teeth'' oftentimes are poorly positioned and do not erupt completely. This method eliminates any future occurrences of a wisdom tooth infection.''In rare instances, the symptoms become so severe that an individual needs to go the hospital emergency room to seek care due to the rapid spread of a pericoronal abscess. This is especially the case if there is swelling of the lymph nodes.'   Management of pain and resolving the pericoronal inflammation and/or infection Minor oral surgery to remove the overlapping gingival tissue (operculectomy) Removal of the wisdom tooth"
Are home remedies effective for pericoronitis?,"'Sometimes, mild symptoms of pericoronitis can be treated at home through meticulous oral hygiene without the use of antibiotics. Thorough and gentle brushing of the area with a small-headed ''toothbrush'' may help to break up the plaque or food that is trapped. Oral water irrigators can be effective in clearing out the debris trapped under the operculum, as well. Rinsing with warm saltwater can help to soothe the area. Additionally, diluted hydrogen peroxide can be used as a rinse or irrigating solution to help reduce the bacteria in the area.''For severe pericoronitis where swelling and fever are present, home treatments are not advised and proper care should be sought with the appropriate health care professional.' "
What is the prognosis for pericoronitis?,"'The prognosis for pericoronitis is usually very good. With timely care and treatment, pericoronitis can properly be managed or eliminated. Symptoms of pericoronitis can last for days to weeks depending on the severity. The condition should resolve in approximately one to two weeks with treatment. If the initial cause of the infection is not treated, the condition will likely return.''Complications can occur with pericoronitis. Although rare, the infection can spread from the mouth into the head and neck and cause a serious complication called ""Ludwig\'s ''angina''."" This can be a life-threatening condition where the ''airway'' could be blocked. Another life-threatening concern is the spread of the infection to the bloodstream (''sepsis''). Symptoms are to be addressed as soon as possible to avoid any possible complications.' "
Is it possible to prevent pericoronitis?,"'Prevention'' of pericoronitis may be achieved with conscientious oral hygiene, regular dental visits, and preemptive care. The dentist can aid in keeping these potential problem areas clean and determine the need for removal of the operculum. Alternatively, the dentist can also monitor the eruption of the third molars and determine the need for early extraction of these ''teeth''. Removal of the wisdom teeth prior to eruption can prevent pericoronitis.' "
What is perimenopause?,"'Perimenopause refers to the time period that begins when the ovaries begin to decline in function and continues until menopause (defined as the total cessation of menstrual flow for one calendar year) has been reached. Perimenopause has been called the ""''change of life''"" or ""transition period."" It usually begins in the 40s, but may start as early as the late 30s. During this time, a woman may exhibit a number of symptoms that are largely due to abnormal hormonal fluctuations.'""Perimenopause has the potential to become a difficult period in a woman's life, as the ovaries begin to become depleted in eggs and produce hormones in reduced amounts. It is important that each woman attempt to understand the alterations that her body is undergoing and attempt to proactively manage these physiological changes. Moreover, she should not attempt hide her feelings and symptoms from others involved in her life, as this may lead to misunderstanding and frustration. Professional help is available, and new products and technologies are constantly being developed to assist with the control of perimenopausal symptoms. With appropriate dialogue between a woman and her health-care professional, most women can navigate this potentially difficult period of their lives."" "
What causes a woman to go through perimenopause?,"'Every woman is endowed at birth with a set number of eggs within each ovary. As she enters adolescence, the higher brain centers that are responsible for the onset of ''puberty'' begin to mature and function in a coordinated fashion. Menstrual cycles begin, and once a month, one of the ovaries will release an egg, which may be fertilized if intercourse occurs during the days when the egg is viable. If ''fertilization'' does not occur, the egg, which is composed of a single cell, degenerates and dies within the abdominal ''cavity''. Without fertilization of the egg, the uterine lining is shed off approximately two weeks after ''ovulation'' (i.e. release of an egg by the ovary). This cycle is repeated monthly unless a ''pregnancy'' is conceived. As a woman ages, her ovaries become depleted of eggs. At this point, ovulation may become erratic. This results in irregular bleeding episodes that may be heavy and unpredictable.''Throughout the normal ''menstrual cycle'', hormones are produced from the ovaries in a rather precise sequence. This can cause numerous side effects (for example, ''menstrual cramps'',) which may or may not be predictable. As the ovaries become depleted of eggs and bleeding episodes become more erratic, there are alterations in the quantity and frequency of ovarian hormone production, which can lead to numerous physical manifestations. The time period when the depletion of ovarian eggs results in irregular bleeding and other related symptoms has been termed ""perimenopause.""' "
13 Causes of perimenopause,"'The ovaries are responsible for the production of the hormone estrogen in a reproducible pattern. As the ovaries become deficient in eggs (ova), the production of estrogen becomes less precise. Estrogen is the hormone that, when produced in the normal sequence and concentration, results in the orderly shedding of the uterine lining. If the estrogen production is not regular, the uterine lining or ''endometrium'' maybe shed off in small amounts, resulting in irregular vaginal ''spotting''. The time interval between ovulatory events may lengthen. During that long interval, the ''endometrium'' continues to grow and may become quite thick. When the ovary finally releases another egg and subsequent shedding of a thickened uterine lining occurs, the menstrual flow may be extremely heavy and associated with severe ''cramps''.''Hot flashes'""\xa0are episodic sensations of heat rising over the neck and facial areas of a woman's body, followed by profuse\xa0""'sweating''. They can be extremely disturbing and may result in difficulties with concentration. Hot flashes are thought to be due to transient dilation of the blood vessels near the surface of the body due to estrogen deficiency. They frequently persist for years after\xa0''menstruation''\xa0has ceased (i.e. a woman has experienced menopause).''With normal menstrual cycles, the female breasts tend to retain fluid as the next period approaches. This is in response to ongoing estrogen production, which continues throughout the cycle, but tends to diminish with approaching\xa0''menstruation''. As a woman nears perimenopause ovarian estrogen production becomes erratic. The breasts may become tender due to estrogen-induced fluid retention. The fact that the interval between ovulation tends to increase means that estrogen continues to be produced in large amounts between periods, and fluid retention continues until the next menstrual flow begins.''Many studies have shown that during perimenopause, the overall estrogen production by the ovaries increases, but day-to-day production may be unpredictable. On some days when estrogen production is high, a woman may experience\xa0''nausea''. In some individuals, this can be sufficiently severe enough to require treatment with medication.''The term ''night sweats'' refer to hot flushes that occur at night. They may occur as frequently as once an hour, and they tend to awaken women from\xa0''sleep''.\xa0''Insomnia''\xa0is a frequent accompaniment of night sweats that can, in turn, lead to irritability and\xa0''depression''. Difficulty carrying out normal daily tasks may occur due to the\xa0''fatigue''\xa0incurred because of night sweat induced\xa0''insomnia''.''As previously mentioned, estrogen produced erratically and in large concentrations tends to cause fluid retention. This may lead to overall swelling of the body swelling due to fluid accumulation. This fluid may contribute to transient weight gain, which may be transient. In addition, estrogen production can affect the higher brain centers, which control appetite, so as to increase hunger. It is not uncommon for women in perimenopause to gain a significant amount of body fat.''As a woman ages and her ovaries begin to run out of eggs, and pregnancy will become more difficult to achieve. In addition, the quality of the remaining eggs diminishes as they age. If a pregnancy is achieved, the chance of\xa0''miscarriage''\xa0is increased because a higher percentage of the remaining eggs is chromosomally abnormal, leading the body to reject what would otherwise be a defective embryo.''Many women feel that when their menstrual cycles become erratic they cannot conceive. Thus they do not practice\xa0''contraception''. As a result, these women may find that they are\xa0''pregnant''\xa0at a time in their life when they are not prepared to begin the odyssey of child-rearing. Many studies have shown that the elective abortion rate is highest in women who are over forty years of age, and they are faced with an unwanted pregnancy.''Estrogen is intimately involved in the metabolism of bone. Normally, calcium in the bones is in a state of equilibrium, in which the calcium leaving the bone at any given time is being replaced by calcium entering the bone. As estrogen production diminishes and becomes more erratic, this equilibrium is altered to result in a net outflow of calcium from bone. Over time, the bone calcium may become severely depleted, leading to the common condition known as\xa0''osteoporosis''\xa0or decreased\xa0''bone density''.\xa0''Osteoporosis''\xa0in elderly patients is a national epidemic, with billions of dollars being spent each year on the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.''Mood swings'',\xa0''depression'',\xa0''anxiety'', and irritability occur frequently during perimenopause. A common denominator for these issues is undoubtedly the night sweats, which can cause\xa0''insomnia'"", and disrupt the body's intrinsic diurnal rhythm. Many women find that day-to-day activities that previously could have been accomplished without difficulty become major challenges. Interpersonal relationships may suffer, particularly if the woman is unable to understand what she is experiencing and verbalize her concerns to those around her. Transient\xa0""'memory loss''\xa0is also common.''Low estrogen levels tend to favor an elevation of so-called low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. These are commonly referred to as ""bad\xa0''cholesterol''"". In addition, declining estrogen tends to also favor a decrease in high-density (''HDL'') lipoprotein, so-called ""good cholesterol"". These\xa0''lipid''\xa0changes may predispose a woman to\xa0''heart disease''.''As menopause approaches, many women find that they experience a diminished desire for sexual intimacy. Undoubtedly,\xa0''chronic fatigue''\xa0and altered\xa0''sleep''\xa0patterns play major roles in causing this problem. In addition to estrogen, the ovary normally produces testosterone, which is largely responsible for sex drive. As the woman ages, the amount of testosterone that the ovary produces diminishes, thus contributing to a\xa0''decreased libido''.''The vagina is an organ that responds to estrogen. Normally, the vagina is lined by cells that contain water, which allows it to expand properly. This contributes to pliability that facilitates vaginal expansion during intercourse. If a woman is estrogen-deficient, the cells lining the vagina lose their hydration and become dried out. The vagina begins to shrink in diameter and length, which can result in\xa0''painful intercourse''. As the walls of the vagina become thinner and underlying blood vessels are ultimately become exposed,\xa0''vaginal bleeding''\xa0may occur when intercourse is attempted.''Blood flow to the vagina is also altered by the presence or absence of estrogen. If the estrogen levels are decreased, normal lubrication of the vagina may also be inadequate, and sexual arousal may become difficult.''The bladder and the urethra (the tube that conducts urine outward from the bladder) are responsive to the presence of estrogen. Women with low systemic estrogen levels:' are more likely to be susceptible to urinary tract infections (UTIs) may feel the need to urinate more frequently (urinary urgency) may have a loss of the ability to hold back the flow of urine with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as occurs with sneezing, coughing, and heavy lifting This is due, in part, to a decrease in pressure within the urethra caused by local estrogen deficiency."
What kind of doctor treats a woman in perimenopause?,'Both primary care practitioners such as internal medicine specialists and family practitioners as well as gynecologists may provide treatment for perimenopausal symptoms. A ''urologist'' may be consulted for some cases where the bladder and urethra is involved.' 
When should I contact my doctor if I think I may be experiencing perimenopausal symptoms?,"'Management of the perimenopause is largely dependent on the severity of symptoms. However, there are certain risk factors which may indicate that a woman is prone to more serious problems. If she is in one of these high risk groups, she should seek care as soon as any of the symptoms of perimenopause begin. These include:''In addition to the high risk groups listed above, a woman should consult a health-care professional if she experiences extremely heavy or irregular ''vaginal bleeding''. Occasionally ''uterine cancer'' is found in a woman whose ovaries are not working optimally.' Cigarette smoking: Carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke is found in the bloodstream in high concentrations during the act of smoking. This compound causes net loss of bone calcium. If a woman smokes and is perimenopausal, she should seek professional care from a health-care professional who can assist her with efforts at smoking cessation. Steroid usage: Many patients use steroids chronically for the treatment of many diseases (for example, asthma). Steroids affect the bones by depleting calcium. Such individuals are at high risk of osteoporosis if their overall estrogen production is erratic or low. Family history: If there is a family history of early menopause, it may be prudent for a woman to seek medical care shortly after experiencing the onset of perimenopausal symptoms. Small body frame: If a woman is thin with small bones, her bone mass is, for practical purposes, deficient in calcium. She should see her doctor in order to formulate a plan to proactively prevent further skeletal deterioration."
Is there a test for perimenopause?,"'Once a woman has made the decision to seek treatment for the management of perimenopausal symptomatology, she should choose a doctor with whom she is comfortable. Her doctor should perform a complete history with specific reference to her any current diseases for which she is being treated. Such a history should include:''A general physical exam should be done, including measurements such as''In addition the health-care professional should review any symptoms that the women is experiencing, including psychiatric symptoms''Laboratory tests should be individualized for each woman, and may include a:''Measuring the blood and saliva estrogen levels in a woman are, in general, not helpful in diagnosing perimenopause.''Other tests that may be performed include:''Once these test results have been received, her doctor will be prepared to outline a plan of treatment for the perimenopause and the ''prevention'' of its consequences. Treatment of any medical problems (for example, ''anemia'' and ''thyroid disease'') should be addressed prior to the treatment of any perimenopausal symptoms.' a listing of all current medications; any pertinent family history; a chronology of tobacco; alcohol; and recreational drug usage. blood pressure height, weight, body mass index determination, and normalcy of thyroid, breast, and pelvic examinations. Complete blood count, Lipid profile, General chemistry panel, Thyroid function testing, Pap smear, and Mammogram. A bone density exam (depending on the woman's risk factors) An endometrial biopsy (sampling of the tissue lining the interior of the uterus) to rule out uterine cancer if the woman has any irregular bleeding (to rule out uterine cancer or pre-malignant changes)."
8 Lifestyle changes to help ease perimenopausal symptoms,"'It is important to consume a healthy ''diet''. This should include foods such as fresh vegetables and whole grain products. Lower calorie dairy products that are rich in calcium, (e.g. milk, cheese, cottage cheese and low-fat ice cream) should also be included.'""It is very important to determine the optimal weight for each individual's height and body type. Body mass index charts should be used, and women should work to maintain their ideal weight.""'Regular moderate physical activity for at least thirty minutes three times per week is ideal. If time is limited, ''aerobic exercise'' such as jogging or fast ''walking'' is preferred. However, if time is not an issue, muscle building or maintenance should be attempted using light weights or other forms of progressive resistance.''This is very important in the management of perimenopause. In ''smokers'', the level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream increases each time a cigarette is consumed. Carbon monoxide has been shown to increase the rate of breakdown of estrogen in the body. This can lead to worsening hot flushes. In addition, smokers tend to lose bone at a higher rate than non-smokers, and this can contribute to worsening ''osteoporosis'' at an accelerated rate.''Women should consider taking vitamin and ''calcium supplements'' during perimenopause. ''Vitamin D'"" is recommended because it's necessary to insure the integrity of normal bone, and many people are deficient in ""'vitamin D'' (''vitamin D'' is frequently derived from sun exposure and eating foods rich in vitamin D). Foods containing significant amounts of vitamin D include:''However, please note that excessively large doses of both calcium and vitamin D can be harmful.''As a matter of general health, attempts to diminish ''stress'' are helpful in controlling the symptoms of perimenopause. ''Yoga'' and deep-''breathing'' exercises during a quiet time tend diminish ''stress'', which can contribute to hot flushes, insomnia, and problematic interpersonal relationships. Other ''stress management techniques'' include:''Attempts to maintain a consistent sleep pattern are advisable. Try to avoid drinking ''caffeine'' late in the day, as this can contribute to insomnia. Insomnia, in turn, may intensify ''depression'' and ''anxiety'', which are frequently seen in perimenopausal women.''Talk to a health-care professional if there are problems with painful intercourse due to ''vaginal dryness''.' Fatty fish (salmon, tuna) Beef liver Cheese Yogurt Egg yolks Selected mushrooms Fortified milk Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals Plan your time. Be prepared. Relax with meditation, deep breathing exercises, Yoga, or Tai Chi. Relax the muscles by taking a hot shower or stretching. Try to exercise at least 10 minutes at a time 2 hours and 30 minutes a week. Pick an activity you enjoy like cycling, walking, swimming, aerobics, or running. Eat healthier foods. Drink alcohol in moderation. Talk to friends or family about issues that are causing you stress. Seek professional help if you need it."
What medications ease perimenopausal symptoms?,"'There are a variety of medications that may ease perimenopausal symptoms in women. These include''There is no ""cure"" for perimenopause.''One of the most effective and infrequently mentioned methods of treating the spectrum of problems encountered during perimenopause is the combination\xa0''birth control pill''. These pills contain synthetic forms of estrogen and\xa0''progesterone'', the two primary hormones produced by a normally functioning ovary. They act by preventing the ovary from releasing its own estrogen and progesterone. They also work to inhibit ovulation, thus preventing pregnancy.''While on\xa0''birth control pills'"", a woman's body responds directly to the hormones in\xa0""'the pill'', and her endogenous ovarian hormone production is suppressed. Thus, the irregular, frequently heavy, menstrual periods, which are common during perimenopause, can be eliminated. She will bleed in response to the hormones in the pills. The\xa0''birth control''\xa0pills also prevent\xa0''ovarian cyst''\xa0formation, which is common during perimenopause and is directly tied to irregular ovulation due to erratic ovarian hormone production.\xa0''Birth control''\xa0pills are also known to decrease breast\xa0''cyst''\xa0formation, and they may also decrease the frequency and intensity of\xa0''headaches''.''Who should not use\xa0''oral contraceptives''\xa0for perimenopausal symptoms?''While oral contraceptives can be used in most patients, women who smoke cannot use these products after the age of 35 because of an increased risk of\xa0''strokes''\xa0and\xa0''heart attacks''. Additionally, they cannot be used in patients with a history of\xa0''blood clot''\xa0formation, breast or uterine\xa0''cancer'', severe\xa0''migraine''\xa0''headaches'', or active\xa0''liver disease''.''Systemic hormonal products are products that reach concentrations in the bloodstream that can affect the entire body. Both estrogen and progesterone formulations are available for use in special situations when treating a perimenopausal woman. If a woman has continued ongoing bleeding, she may be treated with these products in order to temporarily control the blood loss. In lower doses, they do not suppress ovarian hormone production, and this can result in more problematic symptomatology due to hormonal imbalance. Estrogen and progesterone may be taken in pill form or they may be administered transdermally (through the skin) in patches or creams.''These are products that can be inserted into the vagina in order to relieve the symptoms of vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, and urinary tract dysfunction. These are most appropriate for women who are primarily bothered by these local issues and have no other problems such as irregular vaginal bleeding or hot flushes. Studies have shown that these products are not absorbed into the bloodstream in significant concentrations, so that they may be used in women who are unable to use hormone pills or patches in which higher blood estrogen levels are achieved.''Gabapentin is a drug that modifies impulse transmission along the course of nerves. It is used primarily in people who have\xa0''seizures''\xa0or\xa0''chronic pain''\xa0conditions. However, it has some limited efficacy in treating perimenopausal women who cannot use hormone pills or patches because of specific medical conditions (for example, a prior history of\xa0''blood clot''\xa0formation or\xa0''breast cancer'').''Antidepressants, primarily of the class of\xa0''drugs''\xa0referred to as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to decrease hot flashes in some patients.

They are also particularly helpful in women who cannot take systemic hormones because of medical issues.''When decreased libido is a singular problem in a perimenopausal woman, she may be given supplemental testosterone. This can be given in the form of pills, injections, oral or a subcutaneous pellet. The use of testosterone in peri- and\xa0''postmenopausal''\xa0women is controversial, largely because of the side effects some women have while on this therapy.

What should I know about menstruation (monthly period)? What is the medical definition it?*,"'*Medical section written by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD''Everyone (adolescent boys and girls) who is about to enter ''puberty'' (the process of body changes that cause a child’s body to become an adult body capable of reproduction) should be taught or know the basic medical definition of ''menstruation'' and that it is a normal process that females go through as their bodies prepare themselves for potential ''pregnancy''. It is a part of the monthly menstrual cycle (regular ''cycling'' of hormones) that occur in the ''female reproductive system'' that makes pregnancy possible.''Medically, menstruation (also termed period or bleeding) is the process in a woman of discharging (through the vagina) blood and other materials from the lining of the uterus at about one monthly interval from puberty until ''menopause'' (ceasing of regular menstrual cycles), except during pregnancy. This discharging process lasts about 3-5 days.''Beside the bleeding, other signs and symptoms of menstruation may include ''headache'', ''acne'', ''bloating'', pains in the low abdomen, ''tiredness'', ''mood changes'', food cravings, breast soreness, and ''diarrhea''.''The menstrual cycle is the hormonal driven cycle; Day 1 is the first day of your period (bleeding) while day 14 is the approximate day you ovulate and if an egg is not fertilized, hormone levels eventually drop and at about day 25; the egg begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30. Menstruation begins day 1 and normally ends days 3-5 of the menstrual cycle.''At what age do girls go through puberty and begin and start their period (begin to menstruate)?''The average age for a girl to get her first period in the US is 12, but the range of age is about 8 to 15 years old. Women usually have periods until about ages 45 to 55.''The average age for a girl to get her first period in the US is 12, but the range of age is about 8 to 15 years old.

Day 1 is the first day of your period (bleeding) while day 14 is the approximate day you ovulate and if an egg is not fertilized, hormone levels eventually drop and at about day 25. The egg then begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30.''Most periods vary somewhat, the flow may be light, moderate or heavy and can vary in length from about 2 to 7 days; with age, the cycle usually shortens and becomes more regular.''Treatment for the causes of menstrual ''pain'' depend on what the cause is, and may include ''birth control pills'', heavy or prolonged periods, IUDs, noninflammatory steroid ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), for example, ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ), ''aspirin'', ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), and other-the-counter ''pain'' (OTC) medications to relive pain and cramping.''Women should change the pad/tampon before it becomes soaked with blood (about every 4 to 8 hours); follow directions on the box to help avoid ''TSS'' (''toxic shock syndrome''), a potentially deadly disease. Call your doctor or other health professional if you have any abnormalities in your period, for example, excessive bleeding, no periods, severe pain, ''fever'' with tampon use, sudden irregularities, and other problems.'

What is menstruation? What is the menstrual cycle?,"'Menstruation is bleeding from the vagina that happens about once a month, as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. It is also known as having a period.''During this cycle, your hormones make the lining of the uterus become thicker, getting ready in case of pregnancy. Hormones also cause an egg to be released from an ovary, which is known as ''ovulation''.''If you don’t become ''pregnant'', your periods start about two weeks after you ovulate. The lining of the uterus falls away and, along with some blood, flows out through the vagina. Periods can be light or heavy, and the blood can range from bright red to dark brown. You might also notice small clots.''Girls have their first period during puberty. Most often that is around the age 12 or 13 years old, but girls can start menstruating as young as 9, or as late as 16.''bleeding. When you menstruate, your body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from 3 to 5 days.''Menstruation affects every woman, but the experience can differ between women. When periods (menstruations) come regularly, this is called the menstrual cycle. Having regular menstrual cycles is a sign that important parts of your body are working normally. The menstrual cycle provides important body chemicals, called hormones, to keep you healthy. It also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young ''teens''. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of menstration?,"'Some women get symptoms leading up to and during menstruation, for example, ''cramps'' or pains low in the abdomen, bloating or swelling in the abdomen, ''constipation'' before your period, diarhrea when your period starts, ''acne'', tiredeness, and mood changes.' "
When should you call a doctor for problems with your period?,"'See your doctor about your period if:'   You have not started menstruating by the age of 15. You have not started menstruating within 3 years after breast growth began, or if breasts haven't started to grow by age 13. Your period suddenly stops for more than 90 days. Your periods become very irregular after having had regular, monthly cycles. Your period occurs more often than every 21 days or less often than every 35 days. You are bleeding for more than 7 days. You are bleeding more heavily than usual or using more than 1 pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours. You bleed between periods. You have severe pain during your period. You suddenly get a fever and feel sick after using tampons."
What age do girls in the U.S. begin their period?,"'In the United States, the average age for a girl to get her first period is 12. This does not mean that all girls start at the same age. A girl can start her period anytime between the ages of 8 and 15. Most of the time, the first period starts about 2 years after breasts first start to develop. If a girl has not had her first period by age 15, or if it has been more than 2 to 3 years since breast growth started, she should see a doctor.'""During your period, you shed the thickened uterine lining and extra blood through the vagina. Your period may not be the same every month. It may also be different than other women's periods. Periods can be light, moderate, or heavy in terms of how much blood comes out of the vagina. This is called menstrual flow. The length of the period also varies. Most periods last from 3 to 5 days. But, anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal.""  "
When do periods stop?,"'Women usually have periods until ''menopause''. ''Menopause'' occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, usually around age 50. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating (producing eggs) or having periods and can no longer get pregnant. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years.'""For the first few years after menstruation begins, longer cycles are common. A woman's cycle tends to shorten and become more regular with age. Most of the time, periods will be in the range of 21 to 35 days apart.""'Periods stop during pregnancy, and often while you are ''breastfeeding''. Some women find their periods stop for a time because of long-term illness, low body weight, ''stress'', lots of strenuous ''exercise'' and hormone problems. Some medications, such as contraceptives, might stop your period. This can be helpful for some women, especially if their periods are heavy or painful. Sometimes after stopping ''the pill'' or other ''contraceptive'', it can take a while for your periods to come back. Periods stop altogether when women reach menopause - the average age is 51-52.' "
How long is the menstural cycle? How long do periods last?,"'The menstrual cycle is the hormonal driven cycle. Day 1 is the first day of your period (bleeding) while day 14 is the approximate day you ovulate and if an egg is not fertilized, hormone levels eventually drop and at about day 25. The egg then begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30.''Most periods vary somewhat, the flow may be light, moderate or heavy and can vary in length from about 2 to 7 days; with age, the cycle usually shortens and becomes more regular.'  "
What is the treatment for pain and other symptoms caused by menstruation?,"'Treatment for the causes of menstrual pain depend on what the cause is, and may include ''birth control pills'', heavy or prolonged periods, IUDs, noninflammatory steroid drugs (NSAIDs), for example, ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and other-the-counter pain (OTC) medications to relive pain and cramping.' "
What problems occur during menstruation?,"'Problems with periods can include heavy bleeding, period pain (also called dysmenorrhoea), unpredictable or irregular periods, and ''premenstrual syndrome'', or ''PMS'', which makes some women feel irritable and sad and can cause bloating, tender breasts and aching.'  "
How often should I change my pad/tampon?,"'You should change a pad before it becomes soaked with blood. Each woman decides for herself what works best. You should change a tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Make sure to use the lowest absorbency tampon needed for your flow. For example, use junior or regular tampons on the lightest day of your period. Using a super absorbency tampon on your lightest days increases your risk for ''toxic shock syndrome'' (''TSS'""). TSS is a rare but sometimes deadly disease. TSS is caused by bacteria that can produce toxins. If your body can't fight the toxins, your immune (body defense) system reacts and causes the symptoms of TSS (see below).""'Young women may be more likely to get TSS. Using any kind of tampon puts you at greater risk for TSS than using pads. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following tips to help avoid tampon problems:''If you have any of these symptoms of TSS while using tampons, take the tampon out, and contact your doctor right away:'   Follow package directions for insertion. Choose the lowest absorbency for your flow. Change your tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Consider switching between pads and tampons. Know the warning signs of TSS (see below). Don't use tampons between periods. Sudden high fever (over 102 degrees) Muscle aches Diarrhea Vomiting Dizziness and/or fainting Sunburn-like rash Sore throat Bloodshot eyes"
Spotting vs. period differences, Spotting refers to very light vaginal bleeding or brown discharge that occurs mid-cycle between menstrual periods. Menstrual periods are the monthly bleeding that occur in women of reproductive age. Spotting may be due to a number of causes. You should call your doctor or other health care professional if you are pregnant and experience spotting or bleeding of any kind. Implantation bleeding in early pregnancy is a common cause of spotting and is not abnormal.
How to tell if it is your period vs. spotting (symptoms and signs),"'Menstruation'' or the ''menstrual period'' refers to the monthly ''vaginal bleeding'' that is experienced by women of reproductive age. Most women recognize their ''menstrual period''. The typical ''menstrual cycle'' lasts 28 days. The menstrual bleeding is heavy enough to require the use of a pad or tampon and lasts for 3-5 days on average. ''Menstruation'' stops during ''pregnancy''.''Spotting usually is much lighter bleeding than normal menstrual bleeding. Unlike a normal period, it usually is so light that a pad or tampon is not required. Spotting may be red or brown in color and occurs when you are not having your regular period. Spotting may not have any symptoms associated with it, but if it happens as a result of a medical condition, you may have other symptoms like:' Cramps in the abdomen, pelvis, or lower back Bloating or slight weight gain Tender, sore breasts Mood swings Headache Fatigue Heavy bleeding during the menstrual period Irregular periods Abdominal pain Burning or pain during urination Pain or burning during sexual intercourse Vaginal discharge, redness, or itching"
What causes spotting? Is it serious?,"'If you have continuous spotting or abnormal ''vaginal bleeding'', or spotting ''postmenopausal'' you need to be evaluated by doctor or other health care professional.' Implantation bleeding: Many women experience spotting in the early weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. Implantation bleeding is a common cause of spotting. This occurs early in pregnancy, when a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of the uterus (known as implantation). A woman may mistake this light implantation bleeding for a menstrual period and therefore not realize she is pregnant. Birth control: Certain birth control methods can cause spotting, including birth control pills, especially when they are first used. Switching birth control pills or using continuous birth control pills can also cause spotting. Some women with an IUD (intrauterine device) for birth control also report spotting. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in which multiple cysts form in the ovaries. It can make it difficult to get pregnant and can cause irregular periods and bleeding. Benign growths in the uterus or cervix, like fibroids or cervical polyps, can cause irregular bleeding and spotting. Infections, including sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are another possible cause of spotting or breakthrough bleeding in between periods. The menopausal transition is a time when women’s hormone levels can vary widely, sometimes causing spotting or irregular periods. Trauma of any kind, including assault or rough sex, can injure the vagina and lead to bleeding or spotting. While the vast majority of spotting in pregnant women is not due to serious causes, spotting and bleeding in early pregnancy is sometimes related to miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that has implanted outside the womb or uterus, most commonly in the Fallopian tube)."
What are the risk factors for spotting?,"'Spotting is more likely to occur in certain women who:' Are approaching menopause Are pregnant Have switched birth control methods, including having a new IUD in place or having recently started taking birth control pills Have infections of the sex organs including STDs and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Have fibroid tumors of the uterus or cervical polyps Have polycystic ovary syndrome"
How do doctors diagnose the cause of spotting?,"'The cause of ''vaginal bleeding'' or spotting requires a thorough history of the symptoms (when the bleeding or spotting is occurring and any associated symptoms, ''birth control'' methods, and history of any medical conditions or infections).' A pelvic examination is usually a first step to diagnosis. A pregnancy test is performed for women of reproductive age. Special tests like a Pap smear or cultures may be ordered. In some cases, blood or urine tests are ordered. Imaging studies such as vaginal or abdominal ultrasound may be useful in diagnosing the cause of spotting or bleeding."
What are the treatments for spotting?,"'Treatments for spotting depend on the underlying cause of the spotting. Many causes of spotting are not serious, and there is no treatment required. For infections, antibiotic therapy is indicated. Women with ''PCOS'' who desire to become pregnant can be treated with ''fertility''-enhancing ''drugs'' or assisted reproductive technologies. Surgery can be required in some cases to remove cervical polyps or ''uterine fibroids'' that are causing bleeding. For women who desire a more regular ''menstrual cycle'', sometimes ''birth control pills'' or hormonal treatments can be helpful.' "
What to do if you are not sure if you are spotting or having your period,"'Talk to your doctor or other health care professional if you are not sure if it is your period, or if you are spotting.''Remember, spotting is light bleeding that does not get heavier like a typical menstrual period. The normal menstrual period usually is associated with some other symptoms like breast tenderness or cramps as described previously, and often is accompanied by heavy flow. During the first day of your period bleeding may be light, but it typically becomes heavier over the next few days.''Light bleeding that does not worsen and is not associated with the symptoms of a your period is likely to be spotting.''A home ''pregnancy test'' can be helpful if you believe you are spotting due to early pregnancy, or you may experience early signs and ''symptoms of pregnancy''.''You should always contact your doctor or other health care professional if you experience any vaginal bleeding, spotting if you are pregnant or if you have reached ''menopause'', or any time you have unusual bleeding that concerns you.' "
Introduction to PLMD,"'Periodic limb movement disorder'' (PLMD) is a ''sleep'' disorder characterized by rhythmic movements of the limbs during ''sleep''. The movements typically involve the legs, but upper extremity movements may also occur. Movements occur periodically throughout the night and can fluctuate in severity from one night to the next. They tend to cluster in episodes that last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. These movements are very different from the normal spasms, called hypnic myoclonia, that we often experience initially while trying to fall asleep.'  "
What Causes PLMD?,"'The causes of PLMD are unknown. However recent research has shown that people with a variety of medical problems, including '""Parkinson's""' disease and ''narcolepsy'', may have frequent periodic limb movements in sleep.''PLMD may be caused by medications, most notably, ''antidepressants''.' "
What Are the Symptoms of PLMD?,"'Symptoms of PLMD are usually leg movements with the extension of the big toe in combination with a partial flexing of the ankle, knee, or hip. Movement of the legs is more typical than movement of the arms. It can often cause a partial or full brief awakening resulting in fragmented sleep. Patients are frequently unaware of these movements.'  "
How Is PLMD Diagnosed?,"'A sleep partner may observe PLMD, which often affect the partner before the patient knows of his or her behavior. In other cases, the diagnosis is made on an overnight polysomnogram (a test that records bodily functions during sleep). This test is often used to assess the cause of daytime sleepiness or recurrent awakenings from sleep. Blood work may be done in order to test iron status, ''folic acid'', vitamin B12, thyroid function, and magnesium levels.' "
How Is PLMD Treated?,"'Generally, there are several classes of ''drugs'"" that are used to treat PLMD. These include the Parkinson's disease drugs, anticonvulsant medications, ""'benzodiazepines'"", and narcotics. Current treatment recommendations consider the anti-Parkinson's medications as a first line of defense. Medical treatment of PLMD often significantly reduces or eliminates the symptoms of these disorders.""'There is no cure for PLMD and medical treatment must be continued to provide relief.'  "
What Should Someone With PLMD Avoid?,"'The use of ''caffeine'' often intensifies PLMD symptoms. ''Caffeine''-containing products such as ''chocolate'', coffee, tea, and soft ''drinks'' should be avoided. Also many antidepressants can worsen PLMD.''WebMD Medical Reference'  "
What is a periodic paralysis syndrome?,"'Periodic paralysis syndrome is a group of rare muscle diseases that cause temporary episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. There are seven to eight types of periodic paralysis syndromes in the medical literature. However, not all doctors agree with this number. Some doctors list fewer types because they group them together.' "
Is periodic paralysis syndrome a genetic disease? How do you get it?,"'Most types of periodic paralysis syndromes are genetic and inherited (autosomal dominant). However, some are due to a sporadic genetic mutation. The genetic changes (both hereditary and sporadic) result in abnormal muscle responses to various stimulations like cold environments or ''exercise'', and/or elevated electrolyte blood levels, like potassium (''hypokalemia'').''You develop the disease by inheriting the altered gene(s) from a parent or by a spontaneous or sporadic mutation in your genetic code.' "
 What are the signs and symptoms of periodic paralysis syndrome?,"'Periodic paralysis syndromes are all characterized by symptoms of episodic muscle weakness that usually resolves. The person regains normal strength between the periods of episodic muscle weakness. Depending upon the type of periodic paralysis, episodic attacks of muscle weakness may last a few minutes or go on for days. Permanent muscle weakness may develop in some types of the disease. The specific signs, symptoms, and causes of the types of periodic paralysis syndromes are grouped or listed based on the signs and symptoms each type produces.' "
"Periodic paralysis syndrome types, symptoms, signs, and triggers","'There are several types of periodic paralysis syndromes.''As previously mentioned, not all doctors agree on the types and may group one or two together, for example, as in familial periodic paralysis.'  Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis or hyperPP: Signs and symptoms of this type usually begin in children younger than 10 years old. The first symptom may be a lagging upper eyelid (a condition in which the muscles of the eyelid do not follow eye movement). Other symptoms include a stiffness or heaviness to the muscles that begins in the thighs and calves, and spreads to the arms and neck. Hypokalemia periodic paralysis 1 or hypoPP1L: Signs and symptoms of this type usually begin in childhood, and may continue well into the person’s 30s. The symptoms produced are due to calcium channel mutations in the muscles. People with hypoPP1l also experience irregular heartbeats. Hypokalemia periodic paralysis 2 or hypoPP2: This type is the same as hypoPP 1, but it is due to sodium channel mutation in the muscles instead of calcium channel mutations. Normokalemic periodic paralysis: This is a variant form of hyperPP, which the person to become weak when potassium levels increase during normal variations of potassium levels. Some doctors consider this a variant of hyperPP. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis or TPP: Adults in their 20s, 30s, and 40s (especially Asian males) usually have this form, and symptoms are weakness that may involve the respiratory muscles. Hyperinsulinemia and a carbohydrate intake may trigger a paralytic attack and is associated with an overactive thyroid gland. Paramyotonia congenita or PCM: This type usually occurs in conjunction with hyperPP and produces muscle stiffness or rigidity, weakness response to cold temperatures or increased activity; and is caused by mutation in genes that form the sodium channel of the muscles. Potassium aggravated myotonias or PAMS: In this form, potassium intake triggers an attack of muscle stiffness that can brought on by exercise. Andersen-Tawil syndrome or ATS: People with this type have inconsistent potassium shifts during attacks of paralysis, and may have symptoms of irregular heart rhythms including a prolonged QT interval. Some people with this genetic disease have unusual body, facial, and hand characteristics such a short stature, scoliosis, widely spaced eyes, small jaw, and low-set ears. Familial periodic paralysis: Doctors use this term to describe four types of periodic paralysis: hypokalemic, hypokalemic, and thyrotoxic and Andersen-Tawil syndrome."
What determines which kind of periodic paralysis syndrome a person has? ,"'The genetic alterations in the chromosomes determines which kind of periodic paralysis syndrome develops. For example, hyperPP is due to gene SNC4A while hypoPP1 is due to gene CACNAIS.' "
How is periodic paralysis syndrome diagnosed?,"'A periodic paralysis syndrome is diagnosed preliminarily by the characteristic symptoms that each type of syndrome produce. Further evidence for the diagnosis are:''Some doctors also use proactive testing to diagnose the syndrome. This type of test uses IV solutions to stimulate or reproduce your symptoms. However, this test is considered potentially dangerous, and should only be performed on a patient in the presence of a well-trained doctor (usually a neurologist).'   Elevated creatinine phosphokinase blood levels, potassium levels, and ECG tracings Repetitive stimulation of nerves electrically (electrodiagnosis) Cooling the affected muscles to 20C (68F) Exercise testing Needle electrode examination (examination of electrically caused muscle contraction). Muscle biopsies"
What about ruling out other diseases or syndromes for this condition (differential diagnosis)?,"'Your doctor or other medical specialist, for example, a neurologist, will likely run some preliminary tests to rule in or rule out (called a differential diagnosis) other causes of muscle weakness such as ''licorice'' intoxication, ''laxative abuse'', and/or severe ''diarrhea''.' "
Is there a diet to manage symptoms?,"'An appropriate ''diet'' may help decrease the frequency of attacks and/or muscle weakness in some of the syndromes. For example, a low carbohydrate and low-sodium diet may reduce the frequency of paralysis attacks, while a diet with glucose containing candy or a carbohydrate diet with ''low potassium'' may improve weakness in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis syndrome.' "
How is periodic paralysis syndrome treated and managed?,"'Treatment depends upon the type of periodic paralysis syndrome you have. Treatment therapies include medications such as dichlorphenamide (Keveyis), oral and/or IV potassium, ''acetazolamide'', and diuretics. Some patients require beta blocker medication, ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), and other ''drugs''. Your neurologist and/or geneticist can advise you on the drugs most effective for your individual problem. Dietary considerations also are important.' "
Can I pass a periodic paralysis syndrome on to my children? , 
Who should get genetic testing for periodic paralysis syndrome?,"'If either one of your parents has been diagnosed with any type of periodic paralysis syndrome, and/or if you have symptoms that are similar to any of those of periodic paralysis syndrome and have had no definitive diagnosis of your problems, you might ask your doctor if you should be tested for periodic paralysis syndrome.' "
What is gum disease (gingivitis)?,"'Gingivitis'', the earliest stage of gum disease, is inflammation of the tissues surrounding and supporting the ''teeth'' and is most commonly a result of poor ''dental hygiene''. ''Gingivitis'' is a very common condition and varies widely in severity. It is characterized by red, swollen gums that bleed easily when ''teeth'' are brushed or flossed. Gingivitis is not the same thing as periodontitis. Gingivitis always precedes and acts as a warning sign for the more serious condition of periodontitis.'""Gingivitis starts when food debris mixes with saliva and bacteria which, in turn, forms dental plaque that sticks to the surfaces of teeth. If dental plaque isn't removed by brushing with ""'toothpaste'' and flossing, it can become mineralized and form tartar, or calculus. Tartar is very hard, and only a professional dental cleaning can remove it.'""Both dental plaque and tartar are filled with harmful bacteria, and if they aren't removed from teeth, they will begin to irritate the gums and cause gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis will often extend from the gums to the bone and lead to periodontitis."" "
What is the difference between gingivitis and periodontitis?,"'While gingivitis is inflammation of the gums around the teeth, periodontitis occurs when the bone below the gums gets inflamed or infected. Periodontitis derives from the word ''periodontal,'' which means ""around the tooth"" and refers to the structures that surround and support teeth such as gum and bone. Periodontology is the study of the supporting structures of the teeth.''When the underlying bone gets infected, the gums will start to recede away from the teeth and form deep gum pockets. This is called attachment loss. These pockets readily collect plaque and bacteria. Because these pockets are very difficult to keep clean, more bone loss occurs. As periodontal disease progresses into later stages (early, moderate, and advanced) and more bone tissue is lost, the gum pockets are deeper and the teeth may eventually become loose and fall out.' "
What causes gum disease?,"'Improper oral hygiene that allows bacteria in plaque and calculus to remain on the teeth and infect the gums is the primary cause of gum disease. But there are other factors that increase the risk of developing gingivitis. Here are some of the most common risk factors:' Smoking or chewing tobacco prevents the gum tissue from being able to heal. Crooked, rotated, or overlapping teeth create more areas for plaque and calculus to accumulate and are harder to keep clean. Hormonal changes in puberty, pregnancy, and menopause typically correlate with a rise in gingivitis. The increase in hormones causes the blood vessels in the gums to be more susceptible to bacterial and chemical attack. At puberty, the prevalence of gingivitis ranges between 70%-90%. Cancer and cancer treatment can make a person more susceptible to infection and increase the risk of gum disease. Alcohol negatively affects oral defense mechanisms. Stress impairs the body's immune response to bacterial invasion. Mouth breathing can be harsh on the gums when they aren't protected by the lips, causing chronic irritation and inflammation. Poor nutrition, such as a diet high in sugar and carbohydrates and low in water intake, will increase the formation of plaque. Also, a deficiency of important nutrients such as vitamin C will impair healing. Diabetes mellitus impairs circulation and the gums ability to heal. Medications such as antiseizure medications increase the risk for gum disease. Infrequent or no dental care Poor saliva production"
Does gum disease cause bad breath?,"'Bad breath'', or ''halitosis'', is most frequently associated with gum disease. The oral bacteria that is present in the mouth release chemical gases called volatile sulfur compounds that have a strong odor. ''Bad breath'' can also come from the bacterial plaque that builds up on the tongue. When the plaque and tartar are removed from the teeth and tongue with regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, the halitosis can be eliminated. This is the easiest way to reverse bad breath, but it can take a while for the mouth odor to completely disappear. A person needs to be consistent and persistent with oral hygiene to reverse the condition.''Other causes of bad breath include partially erupted ''wisdom teeth'', ''dry mouth'', mouth breathing, ''postnasal drip'', infections in the throat or ''lungs'', ''tonsil stones'', ''smoking'', digestive problems, and systemic diseases like ''diabetes''.' "
What does gum disease look like? What are gum disease symptoms and signs?,"'A person with gum disease will typically have one or more of the following signs and symptoms:''As gingivitis progresses (chronic gingivitis), various complications may arise. If gingivitis advances to periodontitis, the affected person may develop receding gums or areas where the root of the tooth becomes uncovered by the shrinking, diseased gums. Deep pockets may also develop around the teeth that trap food, plaque, and debris. As periodontitis develops, the person may lose gum tissue or bone around the teeth and the teeth may become loose or fall out. These changes can develop either very slowly or very rapidly and can affect either a few teeth or the entire mouth. If oral hygiene is almost never performed or if the person becomes immune-compromised, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis can develop (ANUG, formerly termed trench mouth). This is a painful condition where infected gums swell, ulcerate, and slough off dead tissue.''In the case of ''dental implants'', peri-implant disease occurs where bacteria can cause irritation, inflammation, and destruction of the surrounding gum and bone much in the same way that periodontal disease affects the surrounding structures of teeth.'""It is possible to have gingivitis or periodontitis and not notice any signs or symptoms, so regular visits to a dental professional are vital in determining a patient's specific risk level. The dentist is the primary care provider of the mouth and will be able to provide all of the facts and information necessary in diagnosing the disease and taking steps in treating gum disease.""   Bright red, swollen gums that bleed very easily, even during brushing or flossing A bad taste or persistent mouth odor White spots or plaques on the gums Gums that look like they're pulling away from the teeth Pus between gums or interdental spaces A change in the way the teeth fit together in the mouth or spaces opening up between teeth Loose teeth or tooth loss Change in the way partial dentures fit"
How do health care professionals diagnose gum disease?,"'The following methods and symptoms and signs are very useful in the diagnosis of gum disease during routine checkups:' Measuring the gums: A dentist or dental hygienist will use a periodontal probe to measure the depths of the pockets around all of the teeth in the mouth generally once per calendar year. Healthy gums will have pockets 1 mm-3 mm deep. Beyond that, the deeper the pockets, the more severe the disease. Taking X-rays: Dental X-rays, particularly bitewing X-rays, will help show the level of the underlying bone and whether any bone has been lost to periodontal disease. Examining sensitive teeth: Teeth that have become sensitive around the gum line may indicate areas of receding gums. Check for loose teeth: Teeth may become loose due to bone loss or an incorrect bite. Checking the gums: A dentist or hygienist will look for red, swollen, or bleeding gums."
What is the treatment for gum disease?,"'The treatment goals for gingivitis are to identify and eliminate the factors that make the person more susceptible to gum disease. Most factors can be eliminated by establishing more consistent and thorough oral hygiene habits and professional dental cleanings. If there are certain risk factors such as ''smoking'' or uncontrolled ''diabetes'' that are contributing to the gum disease, they need to be addressed or eliminated to have success in reversing gingivitis. After the plaque and tartar are removed by a dentist or dental hygienist, the patient can usually eliminate gingivitis by brushing and flossing after every meal. Under the supervision of a dentist, a patient can use a prescription mouth rinse that specifically targets oral bacteria that cause gum disease. This is especially helpful in patients where conventional oral hygiene practices like brushing and flossing are impaired due to age or special needs.'""In individuals where gingivitis has led to periodontal disease and there are deep pockets that are difficult to clean, the patient may require deep scaling and root planing to clean teeth that are surrounded by deep pockets. They may need surgical treatment to gain access to all the tooth surfaces for a more thorough cleaning. This surgical procedure is called flap surgery and can be combined with a pocket-reduction surgery to make the areas around the teeth easier for the patient to clean with brushing and flossing. This procedure consists of numbing the gums and then lifting them back to expose and clean the teeth and sometimes reshape the bone. The gums are then repositioned back around the teeth so there aren't the deep pockets that existed before treatment.""'Soft-tissue grafts cover up root surfaces exposed by receding gums. This can help eliminate sensitive teeth and protect the root surfaces that are softer and more difficult to clean.''Laser therapy is another treatment to help increase gum health. The gum pocket is treated with a soft-tissue laser to eliminate the harmful bacteria deep in the periodontal pockets, remove unhealthy tissue, and help stimulate healing.'  "
What types of specialists treat gum disease?,"'Periodontists are dentists who have completed additional training in periodontology after dental school. They are focused entirely on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of disease of the gum and bone surrounding the teeth. In advanced cases of gingivitis or periodontitis, a general dentist may recommend a gross debridement of superficial plaque and tartar and will then refer the affected patient to a periodontist for evaluation. Periodontists may recommend a variety of nonsurgical or surgical procedures to help stabilize the gum condition. Periodontists are also very skilled at performing treatments of other conditions of the gums and bone including gum and bone grafts, functional and esthetic gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, implants, and ''crown'' lengthening. Because gum disease in its advanced stages is the primary cause of tooth loss today, periodontists are especially important in working to treat a difficult disease.' "
What types of medications are used to treat gum disease?,"'Chlorhexidine gluconate (''Peridex'') is an antiseptic mouthwash that can be used under the direction of a dentist to help reduce the bacteria that cause gum disease. Additionally, antibiotic therapy can be combined in various ways to help treat periodontitis. Pellets or gels like PerioChip that contain the chlorhexidine or ''doxycycline'' can be placed in deep gum pockets after deep scaling and root planing to kill stubborn bacteria and reduce the size of periodontal pockets. These modes of delivering medications are very effective because the agent is released slowly over the course of about seven days. Additional medications such as ''Xylocaine'' and ''NSAIDs'' may be needed for ''pain'' control during and after treatment.' "
Are home remedies or natural treatments effective for gum disease?,"'There has been evidence to suggest the effectiveness of the following ''over-the-counter'' and natural treatments for gum disease:'   Green tea has antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body. Hydrogen peroxide helps kill bacteria when used as a mouthwash or as a gel in a custom fitted tray, but it cannot be swallowed. Warm saltwater rinses can help to soothe sore mouth tissue. Baking soda diluted in water can be used to rinse and brush the teeth and gumline to help neutralize the acids that irritate the gum tissue. Oil pulling (swishing or rinsing): There has been little evidence to prove that sesame oil or coconut oil can help reduce bacteria that cause gum disease, but has been become a recent trend. On a case by case basis, people have noticed improvement with this treatment. In addition, see the section on prevention of gum disease and on toothpaste."
Is it possible to reverse gum disease?,"'As long as the causes of early stage gum disease (gingivitis) are correctly identified and the patient is persistent in improving their oral hygiene and seeking necessary treatment, gum disease can be reversible. The prognosis is best when treatment is obtained in early stages of gingivitis. At this stage, the affected person usually just needs a professional dental cleaning and more thorough brushing and flossing to reverse the disease. Once the bacteria spreads to the bones in periodontitis, irreversible changes can start to take place with loss of attachment of the gums and bone loss. Therefore, it is very important to catch and treat gum disease as early as possible.' "
Is gum disease associated with other health problems?,"'There have been many attempts to understand the link between gum disease and other systemic health problems such as ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and '""Alzheimer's""' disease. Comparing the bacteria that cause dental plaque with the bacteria involved in ''heart disease'' suggests a correlation between gum disease and ''heart disease'', but researchers have been unable to establish a cause and effect relationship. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, recent studies have shown that periodontal disease bacteria may play a role in the pathology of '""Alzheimer's""' disease. These types of relationships are difficult to prove or disprove, so it is fair to assume that aiming for a life free of gum disease will only help in leading a generally healthier life.'""While it may be hard to prove what health problems are directly caused by gum disease, it is known that certain health problems can cause gum disease. If there are any sudden changes to a person's medical condition, they should ask their primary care provider or dentist if there might be any effects on ""'oral health'"". Healthy gums can quickly become threatened when the body's overall health diminishes or changes for any reason.""  "
How is gum disease managed in children?,"'A child should start having his or her teeth brushed with a pea-sized amount of toothpaste beginning at 12 months of age. Emphasis should be placed on brushing all surfaces of the teeth including the gum line. As soon as the gaps between the teeth start to close, it is important to start flossing. At the beginning, the parents should establish a routine to brush the teeth so the child can get used to it. As soon as the child is able, the brushing and flossing should be passed over to him or her and monitored by the parent to ensure good thorough technique and consistency. According to the American Dental Association, a child should get regular dental visits starting at about one year of age. Abiding by these guidelines will help prevent and treat gum disease in most children.''It is common for there to be an increase in gingivitis during puberty due to the hormonal changes that occur throughout the body. Adolescents should be monitored for good oral hygiene habits and taken to the dentist regularly to treat gum disease with professional dental cleanings.' "
How is gum disease managed in pregnancy?,"'Many women who become ''pregnant'"" think that they should avoid the dentist to keep their pregnancy safe, but they shouldn't miss their professional cleanings as long as they feel strong and comfortable enough. During pregnancy, women are at risk of developing pregnancy gingivitis. Because of the increase in hormones that occurs with pregnancy, the gum tissues are more susceptible to attack from bacteria and other pathogens. Pregnant women will often notice an increase in swollen, bleeding gums even if their oral hygiene has remained consistent. It may be necessary to get dental cleanings more often than usual during pregnancy to help combat this increased risk."" "
Is it possible to prevent gum disease?,"'Prevention of gingivitis and periodontitis is very simple in most cases. Gum disease is best prevented through proper plaque control. This involves brushing to remove plaque from the outer surfaces of the teeth and flossing to remove food particles and plaque from in between the teeth. Electronic toothbrushes tend to make it easier to remove plaque from some of the harder to reach areas of the mouth. Using a mouthwash after brushing and flossing can also help by reducing the bacteria that cause gingivitis.''Besides these basic oral hygiene practices, there are other things that can be done to eliminate the factors that lead to an increase in gum disease:' Sleep/stress: The immune system is very important in controlling disease, and getting adequate sleep and reducing stress will help the body fight gum disease, too. Stop smoking: Smokers are much more likely to develop gingivitis and periodontitis. Avoiding tobacco should be a primary goal to achieve healthy gums. Orthodontic therapy or braces: It is much easier to remove plaque from straight teeth than crowded, overlapped, and crooked teeth. Braces can make a big difference in having healthier gums. Diet: Limiting the frequency of plaque-causing sugars and carbohydrates will help limit plaque. Eating a well-balanced diet will help keep the body's immune system healthy and ready to fight infection."
What is the best toothpaste to use to prevent gum disease?,"'The goal of toothbrushing is to remove plaque on the teeth that will harbor bacteria and cause gum disease and ''tooth decay''. Just about any toothpaste when used with consistent thorough brushing habits will accomplish this goal. Fluoride in toothpaste, particularly stannous fluoride, helps to kill mouth bacteria. There are other ingredients in toothpastes that help remove plaque more effectively and help keep plaque off the teeth after they have been brushed. The abrasive agents in toothpaste such as silicates and calcium carbonates help remove sticky plaque. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is a detergent in toothpaste that causes the foaming effect of toothpastes. Toothpastes vary in the amount of SLS they contain; a high concentration of SLS can cause problems for patients who have ''dry mouth'"" or low saliva flow. Some toothpastes include plaque-control agents such as pyrophosphates and zinc citrate that prevent plaque from sticking to the teeth after they've been brushed. Using a toothpaste that contains any combination of these ingredients will increase the effectiveness of oral hygiene."" "
Is gum disease contagious?,"'While most of the factors that lead to gingivitis and periodontal disease are dependent on the individual, there has been some limited scientific evidence to affirm that gingivitis and periodontitis-causing bacteria can be passed down from parents to children and between couples.' "
What is peripheral blood stem cell transplantation?,"'Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a treatment which involve first harvesting specific cells called\xa0''stem cells'""\xa0from the peripheral blood of the donor. These cells are harvested by a type of filtration and then preserved, usually by freezing, and finally given to the recipient after he or she has received intensive treatment. The stem cells are usually given instead of bone marrow cells. They go to the recipient's bone marrow spaces and rebuild the bone marrow after the intensive treatment is over. The treatment does not involve surgery, but is nevertheless a form of transplantation."" "
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells are small, round cells with a squat nucleus and scant surrounding cytoplasm. Although unremarkable in appearance, stem cells can perform what have been called ""acts of biological resurrection."" ' "
What do stem cells do?,"'Whereas other types of cells in the body have a limited lifespan and die after dividing their predetermined number of times, a stem cell can reproduce forever. The stem cell is immortal (in cellular terms). A stem cell can forgo immortality and differentiate. By doing so, it can turn into an ordinary blood cell, like a red blood cell (an erythrocyte), a white blood cell (a leukocyte), or a large cell (a megakaryocyte) that fragments into the platelets needed for blood to clot.' "
What is the value of stem cells for transplantation?,"'A relatively small number of stem cells can miraculously repopulate the whole bone marrow, provide an endless supply of stem cells, reconstitute the entire repertoire of blood cells, and restore that portion of the immune system.' "
Where do the stem cells come from for transplantation?,"'Under normal circumstances, stem cells are rarely seen in the blood stream. To recruit enough stem cells into the blood, stem cells are lured out of the bone marrow by a special regimen of ''drugs'' and thereby coaxed into entering the peripheral blood (the blood stream).' "
How are the stem cells removed from the blood?,"'The blood is filtered through a machine and the stem cells are skimmed off. The removal of the cells is termed ''pheresis'' or ''apheresis'' (from the Greek ""aphairesis"" for removal). The stem cells then may be used right away for the transplant or stored suspended in DMSO and frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed.' "
"How is the patient ""prepared""  for the transplantation?","'Before the transplant is done, the patient receives high-dose ''chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'' over several days to destroy diseased cells (the leukemic cells, ''lymphoma'' cells, solid ''tumor'' cells, the diseased immune system cells in ''scleroderma'', etc.)' "
How is the transplantation actually done?,"'Once the chemotherapy is gone, the stem cells are defrosted and returned to the patient as a ''blood transfusion''. They are already biologically programmed to migrate to the bone marrow, where they can produce new blood and immune cells and replace the cells destroyed by the treatment.''The stem-cell preparation is infused into a vein and, once there in the blood stream, the stem cells act like homing pigeons and head straight for the bone marrow space.' "
What is peripheral neuropathy?,"'Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder of nerve(s) apart from the brain and spinal cord. Patients with peripheral neuropathy may have tingling, numbness, unusual sensations, ''weakness'', or burning ''pain'' in the affected area. Oftentimes, the symptoms are symmetrical and involve both hands and feet. Because the symptoms are often present in the areas covered by gloves or stockings, peripheral neuropathy is often described as having a ""glove and stocking"" distribution of symptoms.''Peripheral neuropathy can involve different nerve types, including motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves. Peripheral neuropathy can also be categorized by the size of the nerve fibers involved, large, or small.''Neuropathy can present with many differing symptoms, including numbness, pain of different types, weakness, or loss of balance, depending on the type of nerve involved. Because the autonomic nerves control bodily functions that we do not consciously think of, such as ''heart'' rate, ''digestion'', and emptying of the bowel and bladder, autonomic neuropathy manifests with symptoms affecting the loss of control of these functions. Symptoms may include problems with ''blood pressure'', voiding, passage of stools (''diarrhea'', or ''constipation''), heart rate, or ''sweating''.''Cranial neuropathy is similar to peripheral neuropathy, except that the cranial nerves are involved. Any of the cranial nerves can be involved. One of the more common causes of cranial neuropathy is loss of blood flow from the optic artery to the ''optic nerve'', causing ischemic ''optic neuropathy''. ''Amyloidosis'' is one of the more common causes of this rare disorder.''Specific nerves can be involved in neuropathy. When a specific nerve is involved, the symptoms are limited to the distribution of that nerve. The most commonly involved peripheral nerve is the median nerve at the wrist in ''carpal tunnel syndrome''. Essentially any peripheral nerve can become entrapped and cause the signs and symptoms of neuropathy. The ulnar nerve is commonly entrapped at the elbow. The peroneal nerve is exposed at the outer part of the knee. The pudendal nerve can cause pain in the perineum and is relieved by sitting on a toilet seat or an inflatable donut. Entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at the waist, called ''meralgia paresthetica'', causes numbness at the outer part of the thigh.'  "
What causes peripheral neuropathy?,"'There are many possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, including:''While ''diabetes'' and ''postherpetic neuralgia'' are the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, oftentimes no cause is found. In these situations, it is referred to as idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.''Sometimes, peripheral nerve entrapments, such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', are considered peripheral neuropathies. In these cases, pressure on the nerve rather than a disease state leads to nerve malfunction.'   Diabetes mellitus Shingles (post herpetic neuralgia) Vitamin deficiency, particularly B12 and folate Alcohol Autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Guillain-Barre syndrome AIDS, whether from the disease or its treatment, syphilis, and kidney failure Inherited disorders, such as amyloid polyneuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Exposure to toxins, such as heavy metals, gold compounds, lead, arsenic, mercury, and organophosphate pesticides Cancer therapy drugs such as vincristine (Oncovin and Vincasar) and other medications, such as antibiotics including metronidazole (Flagyl) and isoniazid Rarely, diseases such as neurofibromatosis can lead to peripheral neuropathy. Other rare congenital neuropathies include Fabry disease, Tangier disease, hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, and hereditary amyloidosis. Statin medications have been linked to peripheral neuropathy, although neuropathy caused by statins only rarely causes symptoms."
What are the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy?,"'The ''symptoms of peripheral neuropathy'' somewhat depend on the cause. Usually, peripheral neuropathy affects the nerves of sensation. As a result, people with peripheral neuropathy develop pain, burning, or tingling in the distribution of the affected nerves. Most commonly, this is in the feet and/or hands. This can cause tingling, numbness, and/or burning in the toes or fingers.''When ''shingles'' causes peripheral neuropathy, the particular nerve affected causes a localized burning and ''itching'' sensation, for example, in the side of the chest, the face, the buttock, etc.'  "
What tests diagnose peripheral neuropathy?,"'Because peripheral neuropathy has so many causes and so many presentations, the first step to diagnosis is performing a thorough medical history and physical examination. Certain tests done during the physical exam, including vibration and monofilament testing, are very accurate in diagnosing certain types of peripheral neuropathy, such as large ''fiber'' peripheral neuropathy seen with ''diabetes''. Blood tests for exposure to toxins and electrodiagnostic studies, such as nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (''EMG'') are also very useful, although these tests will not help with the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Either skin biopsies or quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) are occasionally used to help diagnose small fiber neuropathy.' "
What is the treatment for peripheral neuropathy and its symptoms? Can peripheral neuropathy be cured?,"'The treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on its cause. The first step in treatment is, therefore, to look for the cause.'""If a specific treatment isn't available, the pain of the neuropathy can usually be controlled with medications. The simplest treatment is ""'over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications, such as ''acetaminophen'', ''ibuprofen'', or ''aspirin''. ''Tricyclic antidepressants'' such as ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'') or ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor'') and anti-''seizure'' medications, such as ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') have been used to relieve the pain of neuropathy. Capsaicin, the chemical responsible for chili peppers being hot, is available over-the-counter as a cream to help relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy. A prescription patch of 8% capsaicin (Qutenza) is approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. ''Pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') is a medication that is used for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and ''diabetic peripheral neuropathy'', while ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta'') has been approved for use in the treatment of ''diabetic peripheral neuropathy''. In some instances, opioids can be used to help control the pain that can be associated with peripheral neuropathy.''Both Vitamin B6 and alpha-lipoic acid have been used for relief in ''chemotherapy''-induced peripheral neuropathy.''There is ongoing research into treatments for peripheral neuropathy, ranging from evaluating the effectiveness of topical gels to bone marrow treatments. As this research progresses, new therapies will become available.''Individuals who believe that they have peripheral neuropathy should contact their health care professional since many causes of peripheral neuropathy can be successfully treated.' Vitamin deficiencies can be corrected. Diabetes can be controlled, although control may not reverse the neuropathy. The goal with diabetes is early detection and adequate treatment to prevent the occurrence of neuropathy. Neuropathies that are associated with immune diseases can improve with treatment of the autoimmune disease. Neuropathy caused by nerve entrapment can be treated by physical therapy, injections, or surgery. Prompt treatment with sympathetic injections can minimize the chance of shingles progressing to postherpetic neuralgia."
Can peripheral neuropathy be prevented?,"'Certain forms of peripheral neuropathy can be prevented. For example, avoiding alcohol toxicity, getting shingles ''vaccinations'', avoiding heavy metal toxicity, and aggressively treating diabetes are all measures that can help prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy resulting from these causes.' "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "
What is peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) refers to diseases of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) located outside the heart and brain. While there are many causes of peripheral vascular disease, doctors commonly use the term peripheral vascular disease to refer to peripheral artery disease (peripheral arterial disease, PAD), a condition that develops when the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the internal organs, arms, and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of ''atherosclerosis''.' "
Are atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease related?,"'Atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. This buildup of cholesterol plaques causes hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. When this happens in the peripheral circulation, peripheral vascular disease is the result. The atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as ''teens'' in some people). When atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed, atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. Therefore, many adults typically are unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. However, when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with ''aging'', it can cause critical occlusive disease of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen).''Arteries that are narrowed by advanced atherosclerosis can cause diseases in different organs. For example, advanced atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (arteries that supply heart muscles) can lead to ''angina'', coronary ''heart disease'', and ''heart attacks''. Advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) can lead to ''strokes'' and transient ischemic attacks (''TIA''). Advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities can lead to ''pain'' while walking or exercising (''claudication''), deficient ''wound'' healing, and/or leg ulcers.''Atherosclerosis is often generalized, meaning it affects arteries throughout the body. Therefore, patients with ''heart attacks'' are also more likely to develop strokes and peripheral vascular disease, and vice versa.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'Approximately half of people with peripheral artery disease do not experience any symptoms. For patients with symptoms, the most common symptoms are intermittent claudication and rest pain.''Other symptoms and signs of peripheral artery disease include:'   Intermittent claudication refers to arm or leg pain or cramping in the arms or legs that occurs with exercise and goes away with rest. The severity and location of the pain of intermittent claudication vary depending upon the location and extent of blockage of the involved artery. The most common location of intermittent claudication is the calf muscle of the leg, leading to calf or leg pain while walking. The pain in the calf muscle occurs only during exercise such as walking, and the pain steadily increases with continued walking until the patient has to stop due to intolerable pain. Then the pain quickly subsides during rest. Intermittent claudication can affect one or both legs. Rest pain in the legs occurs when the artery occlusion is so critical that there is not enough blood and oxygen supply to the legs even at rest and represents a more serious form of the condition. The pain typically affects the feet, is usually severe, and occurs at night when the patient is lying down, face up. Numbness of the legs or feet Weakness and atrophy (diminished size and strength) of the calf muscle A feeling of coldness in the legs or feet Changes in color of the feet; feet turn pale when they are elevated, and turn dusky red in dependent position Hair loss over the top of the feet and thickening of the toenails Poor wound healing in the legs or feet Painful ulcers and/or gangrene in areas of the feet where blood supply is lost; typically in the toes"
Who is at risk for peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral artery disease (or peripheral arterial disease) that affects approximately 10 million adults in the U.S. About 5% of people over the age of 50 are believed to suffer from peripheral artery disease. Peripheral artery disease is slightly more common in men than in women and most often occurs in older persons (over the age of 50). The known risk factors for peripheral artery disease are those that predispose to the development of atherosclerosis. Risk factors for peripheral artery disease include:''In peripheral artery disease, the risk factors are additive, so that a person with a combination of two risk factors -- ''diabetes'' and ''smoking'', for example -- has an increased likelihood of developing more severe peripheral artery disease than a person with only one risk factor.' High blood cholesterol (elevated levels of the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and triglycerides Low blood levels of the ""good"" HDL cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) High blood pressure (hypertension) or a family history of hypertension A family history of atherosclerotic disease Chronic renal failure Overweight or obesity Physical inactivity"
How does atherosclerosis cause disease?,"'Atherosclerosis causes disease in two ways. 1) Atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to the to tissues of the body during times when oxygen demand needs to be increased, for example, during exertion; or 2) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of ''blood clots''), which results in tissue death (necrosis). Exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand; whereas strokes and ''heart attacks'' are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots.''There are many similarities between coronary heart diseases (or ''coronary artery disease'', which is atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease, and the two conditions may coexist in the same individual. For example, patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. However, during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. Lack of blood and oxygen causes ''chest pain'' (exertional angina). Exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. In patients with intermittent claudication, the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example, a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. These patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting.''Patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. These patients have ''chest pain'' at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. Patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). Rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. They are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene.''When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries, blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas, forming a thrombus, a type of ''blood clot'' (plural thrombi). Sometimes pieces of the ''blood clot'' break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond in which they cannot pass. A thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus. Thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage, leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue due to lack of oxygen).''For example, complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes ''heart attack'', while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic ''stroke''. Emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the ''aorta'' (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet, resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes, foot ulcers, and even gangrene.''Sometimes, despite the presence of a severe blockage in an artery, the involved area does not become painful or lose its blood supply due to the presence of collateral vessels. Collateral circulation means that the particular area is supplied by more than one artery, so that that blockage of a single vessel does not result in a severe degree of blood loss. Collateral circulation can develop over time to help provide oxygenated blood to an area where an artery is narrowed. Doctors believe that regular supervised exercise can stimulate the growth and development of collateral circulation and relieve symptoms of intermittent claudication.' "
What are the other causes of peripheral vascular diseases (PVD)?,"'A number of conditions such as ''vasculitis'' may cause damage to blood vessels throughout the body. Injuries to blood vessels (from accidents such as auto accidents or sports injuries), blood-clotting disorders, and damage to blood vessels during surgery can also lead to inadequate blood supply to body tissues (ischemia).''Tissue ischemia can also occur in the absence of atherosclerosis or other abnormalities of arteries. One example of a condition in which the blood vessels themselves are not damaged is '""Raynaud's disease""', which is believed to occur due to spasms in blood vessels brought on by ''stress'' or a ''cold'' environment.''Since atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries (PAD) is by far the most common cause of peripheral vascular disease, the rest of this article focuses upon peripheral artery disease.' "
Is there a test to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'The doctor will perform a physical exam and look for signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease, for example, weak or absent artery pulses in the extremities, bruits (sounds that can be heard through a stethoscope), ''blood pressure'' changes, and skin color and nail changes''In addition to the history of symptoms and the physical signs of peripheral artery disease imaging tests can be used in the diagnosis of the condition. Imaging tests include:' Doppler ultrasound - This form of ultrasound (measurement of high-frequency sound waves that are reflected off of tissues) that can detect and measure blood flow. Doppler ultrasound is used to measure blood pressures behind the knees and at the ankles. In patients with significant peripheral artery disease in the legs, the blood pressures in the ankles will be lower than the blood pressure in the arms (brachial blood pressure). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a number derived from dividing the ankle blood pressure by the brachial blood pressure. An ankle-brachial index of 0.9 to 1.3 is normal, an ABI less than 0.9 indicate the presence of peripheral artery disease in the arteries in the legs, and an ABI below 0.5 usually indicates severe arterial occlusion in the legs. Duplex ultrasound - This is a color assisted non-invasive technique to study the arteries. Ultrasound probes can be placed on the skin overlying the arteries and can accurately detect the site of artery stenosis as well as measure the degree of obstruction. Angiography - An angiography is an imaging procedure to study the blood vessels of the extremities, similar to the way a coronary angiogram provides an image of the blood vessels supplying the heart. It is the most accurate test to detect the location(s) and severity of artery occlusion, as well as collateral circulations. Small hollow plastic tubes (catheters) are advanced from a small skin puncture at the groin (or the arm), under X-ray guidance, to the aorta and the arteries. Iodine contrast ""dye,"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Angiogram gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select patients for angioplasty or surgical bypass (see below). Because X-ray angiography is invasive with potential side effects (such as injury to blood vessels and contrast dye reactions), it is not used for initial diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. It is only used when a patient with severe peripheral artery disease symptoms is considered for angioplasty or surgery. A number of different imaging methods have been used in angiography examinations, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures and has the advantage of avoiding X-ray radiation exposure."
What are the management and treatment guidelines for peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Treatment goals for peripheral artery disease include:''Treatment of peripheral artery disease includes lifestyle measures, supervised exercises, medications, angioplasty, and surgery.''Proper exercise can condition the muscles to use oxygen effectively and can speed the development of collateral circulation. ''Clinical trials'' have shown that regular supervised exercise can reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication and allow individuals to walk longer before the onset of claudication. Ideally, your health care provider should prescribe an exercise program tailored to your specific needs.''Rehabilitation programs supervised by healthcare professionals such as nurses or physical therapists may help. Exercise at least three times a week, each session lasting longer than 30 to 45 minutes for the best results. Exercise usually involves walking on a monitored treadmill until claudication develops; walking time is then gradually increased with each session. Patients are also monitored for the development of chest pain or heart rhythm irregularities during exercise.'   Relieve the pain of intermittent claudication. Improve exercise tolerance by increasing the walking distance before the onset of claudication. Prevent critical artery occlusion that can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and amputation. Prevent heart attacks and strokes. Smoking cessation eliminates a major risk factor for disease progression, and it lowers the incidences of pain at rest and amputations. Smoking cessation also is important to prevent heart attacks and strokes. A healthy diet can help lower blood cholesterol and other lipid levels and may help control blood pressure. Keep other risk factors, such as diabetes, lipid levels, and blood pressure under control by following medical advice regarding medications and lifestyle changes."
Medications to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'While lifestyle changes may be enough treatment for some people with peripheral artery disease, others may require medication. Examples of medications used to treat peripheral artery disease include antiplatelet or anticlotting agents, cholesterol-lowering ''drugs'' such as ''statins'', medications that increase blood supply to the extremities such as ''cilostazol'' (''Pletal'') and ''pentoxifylline'' (''Trental''), and medications that control ''high blood pressure''.'  Antiplatelet medications (such as aspirin and clopidogrel [Plavix]) make the blood platelets less likely to stick to one another to form blood clots. Low-dose aspirin (81 to 325 mg/day) is usually prescribed indefinitely because it is also helpful in preventing strokes and heart attacks in patients with peripheral artery disease. Clopidogrel (Plavix) is an alternative to aspirin for those who are allergic or cannot tolerate aspirin. Antiplatelet medications also help prevent occlusion of blood vessels after angioplasty or bypass surgery. Anticoagulant medications act to prevent blood clotting. Both heparin and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) are anticoagulant medications. Anticoagulants are sometimes prescribed for people with peripheral artery disease if they are at increased risk for formation of blood clots; these agents are used much less frequently than anti platelet agents in patients with peripheral artery disease. Cholesterol-lowering drugs of the statin class have been shown in numerous large clinical trials to help prevent heart attacks and strokes and prolong survival among patients with atherosclerosis. Statins have also been shown to slow the progression of peripheral artery disease, decrease arthrosclerosis in the arteries, and improve claudication symptoms. Cilostazol (Pletal) is a medication that can help increase physical activity (enabling one to walk a greater distance without the pain of claudication). Cilostazol works by causing dilation of the arteries and an increased supply of oxygenated blood to be delivered to the arms and legs. Cilostazol is recommended for some patients with claudication when lifestyle modifications and exercise are ineffective. Side effects are generally mild and include headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. Cilostazol should not be used in patients with heart failure because of concern over increased mortality in heart failure patients using medications similar to cilostazol. Pentoxifylline (Pentoxyl, Trental) improves blood flow to the extremities by decreasing the viscosity (""stickiness"") of blood, enabling more efficient blood flow. Side effects are fewer than with cilostazol, but its benefits are weaker and have not been conclusively proven by all studies. Drugs to control hypertension may also be prescribed. Current recommendations are to treat hypertension in patients with peripheral artery disease to prevent strokes and heart attacks."
Angioplasty to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'Angioplasty, also known as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or PTA, is a nonsurgical procedure that can widen a narrowed or blocked artery. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery in the groin or arm and advanced to the area of narrowing. A tiny balloon on the tip of the catheter is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. This procedure is also commonly performed to dilate narrowed areas in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.''Sometimes the catheter technique is used to insert a ''stent'' (a cylindrical wire mesh tube) into the affected area of the artery to keep the artery open. In other cases, thrombolytic medications (medications that dissolve blood clots) may be delivered to the blocked area via a catheter.''Angioplasty does not require general anesthesia. Usually, a local anesthetic at the area of catheter insertion and a mild sedative are given. Major complications of angioplasty are rare, but can occur. These include damage to the artery or blood clot formation, excessive bleeding from the catheter insertion site, and abrupt vessel closure (blockage of the treated area occurring within 24 hours of the procedure).''Despite these risks, the overall incidence of complications is low and the benefits of angioplasty (no general anesthesia, no surgical incision, and the ability to return to normal activities within a couple of days) outweigh its risks. Usually a one-night hospital stay is required when angioplasty is performed.''Angioplasty is used when a patient has claudication that limits his or her activities and does not respond to exercise, medications, and lifestyle measures. Most doctors also recommend angioplasty when disease is very severe, and there is a focal, localized narrowing that is accessible via catheter. If a patient is too ill to have surgery and has severe ischemia (decreased oxygen in the tissues) that threatens loss of a limb, angioplasty may also be attempted.''Some cases of peripheral artery disease may be more difficult to treat by angioplasty. For example, blockages in multiple small arteries of the legs or blockages in extremely small vessels may not be treatable by this method.' "
Surgery to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'Surgical treatment for peripheral artery disease involves either bypass vascular surgery performed by a vascular surgeon or endarterectomy. Indications for surgical treatment of peripheral artery disease include lesions that, for anatomical reasons, may be difficult to treat by angioplasty. Examples include lesions covering long segments of a vessel, vessels with multiple narrowed areas, or long areas of narrowing. Bypass surgery involves using a vein from your body or a portion of synthetic vessel (known as grafts) to create a detour around the blockage. One end of the graft is sewn to the damaged artery above the blockage and the other end is sewn below the blocked area. Blood flow is then able to bypass the area of narrowing or blockage Bypass surgery is a major surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia and a hospital stay.''Endarterectomy is a procedure in which the surgeon cleans out plaque buildup inside the artery of the affected leg or arm.'

Which specialties of doctors treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'A number of different specialists may treat individuals with peripheral artery disease, for example, internists, family practitioners, or cardiologists may mange medication treatment. Interventional cardiologists or radiologists may perform angioplasty. Vascular surgeons may perform some surgical procedures to treat peripheral artery disease.' "
What are potential complications of peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'In rare cases, the decreased circulation to the extremities characteristic of peripheral artery disease can lead to open, non-healing sores, ulcers, gangrene, or other limb-threatening injuries to the extremities. The areas that do not receive adequate blood flow are also more prone to develop infections and, in extreme cases, amputation may be necessary.' "
How can I prevent from getting peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral vascular disease related to atherosclerosis can be prevented by minimizing the risk factors that are controllable, such as eating a heart-healthy ''diet'', maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, getting regular exercise, and maintaining good control of blood ''sugar'' levels if you have diabetes.' "
What is peritonitis?,"'The definition of peritonitis is as follows: inflammation of the peritoneum (the thin layer of tissue covering the inside of the abdomen and various organs within the abdomen). Peritonitis usually develops from a bacterial or less frequently, fungal infection; but there are other less often encountered causes of peritoneal inflammation. ''Most individuals need quick or emergent treatment of peritonitis due to infection because infecting organisms can spread rapidly in individuals and become life-threatening. '' ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of peritonitis?,"'The signs and symptoms of peritonitis may vary depending upon the cause of the inflammation; however, there are relatively common indicators that suggest a person may have peritonitis. People usually have abdominal discomfort and one or more of the following:'  

	Abdominal tenderness or pain Abdominal tenderness or pain that 
increases when the abdomen is touched or moved (palpation) Abdominal swelling (bloating or 
distention) 

	Fever 

	Chills 

	Nausea 

	Vomiting 

	Diarrhea Decreased urination 

	Loss of appetite (anorexia) 

	Fatigue and/or weakness 

	Constipation Inability to 
	pass gas Ascites (fluid in the abdominal 
cavity) Unexplained encephalopathy (new onset 
mental changes)"
What are the causes of peritonitis?,"'The causes of peritonitis can be grouped into five categories. The following is a list of these categories and some examples of their causes:''Some health-care professionals choose not to categorize peritonitis; they simply use a modifier placed in front of or behind the term ""peritonitis"" to describe the patient\'s disease. Below are definitions of a sampling of some of these terms:'  Primary peritonitis: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with ascites from patients with cirrhosis (highest risk patients for SBP), heart failure, or patients with systemic lupus and nephrosis. The majority of the cases are caused by a microbial infection. Secondary peritonitis: Secondary peritonitis is caused by infection due to a perforated appendix, perforated ulcers, diverticulitis, or bowel strangulation. Tertiary peritonitis: Tertiary peritonitis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and is referred to as tuberculosis peritonitis. Chemical peritonitis (also termed sterile peritonitis): Chemical peritonitis is caused by leakage of sterile fluids that are irritants to the peritoneum; for example, bile, blood, or barium used as a contrast agent during procedures and tests. Peritoneal abscess: Peritoneal abscess is caused by an infected fluid collection that is encapsulated and/or adjacent to visceral organs and/or the peritoneum. Bacterial peritonitis: any type of peritonitis including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by a bacterial species. Peritonitis appendicitis: peritonitis caused by leakage of the intestinal contents from the appendix. Acute peritonitis: initial rapid onset of peritonitis symptoms. Meconium peritonitis: fetal stool that escapes from fetal bowel prior to birth by rupture and results in sterile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis: leakage of bile fluid into the peritoneum. Septic peritonitis: infection of the peritoneum that has spread to the blood. Sclerosing peritonitis: inflammation of the visceral and parental surfaces of the abdominal cavity characterized by fibrous thickening of the peritoneum. Pelvic peritonitis: inflammation involving the peritoneum surrounding the uterus and Fallopian tubes. Tuberculosis peritonitis: inflammation of the peritoneum by Mycobacterium bacteria. Ascites peritonitis: infection of ascites fluid causing inflammation of the peritoneum. Peritonitis sintomas: Spanish for peritonitis symptoms."
What is the most common type of peritonitis?,"'The most common type of peritonitis is secondary peritonitis, usually caused by a leakage or perforation of an abdominal organ, like the appendix. However, another common type of peritonitis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) that is most often associated with individuals that have abdominal ascites fluid.' "
What kind of doctor treats peritonitis?,"'Peritonitis can rapidly develop into a life-threatening problem. Depending on its cause many different doctors will be involved in the treatment; consequently, peritonitis is seen and treated by ''emergency medicine doctors'', critical-care specialists, dialysis specialists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, hospitalists, internal medicine specialists, and  surgeons. Other specialists may need to treat underlying causes.' "
How is peritonitis diagnosed?,"'Because peritonitis can be life-threatening, early diagnosis is important. Health-care professionals will take a history and perform a physical exam on the patient. They also may ask for details about dialysis, ascites, and\xa0''trauma'' to the abdomen. The patient may have some mild discomfort while the doctor examines his/her abdomen.''Tests that may be ordered include a complete cell count (''CBC''), blood cultures, and imaging tests such as an ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis.''Some patients that do peritoneal dialysis will be asked for a sample of the dialysis fluid so that it can be examined. In some patients with abscesses, examination of the abscess fluid is done.' "
What is the treatment for peritonitis?,"'The treatment for peritonitis begins with correction of the underlying process (for example, appendicitis that has caused peritonitis or bile leakage into the abdominal cavity). In most people with peritonitis there is an infectious source so intravenous antibiotic therapy is started immediately. ''The patient also is likely to require supportive care such as avoiding ''dehydration'', avoiding pulmonary infections that are secondary to the peritonitis, and possibly renal system support (especially in patients undergoing dialysis). ''Reducing the inflammatory response also may be part of supportive treatment. ''Some individuals may require percutaneous abscess drainage to augment antimicrobial therapy. Although there are specific suggestions for antimicrobial therapy for treating infectious peritonitis, optimal antimicrobial therapy should be individualized and depends on the types of infecting organisms and their sensitivity to antimicrobials.' "
What are the complications of peritonitis?,"'The complications of peritonitis can be extremely serious, and include ' dehydration, 
 sepsis,  multiple organ infection and/or failure,  hepatic encephalopathy, 
 hepatorenal syndrome (liver disease leading to increasing 
	renal failure), 
	 shock, 
and  death."
Can peritonitis be prevented?," Prevention or reduction in the chance of developing peritonitis can be done by preventing underlying causes (for example, trauma, ulcers, alcoholic cirrhosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease). Individuals that are obtaining peritoneal dialysis should be very careful about hand and fingernail cleanliness to avoid contamination to the dialysis catheter. Skin adjacent to the dialysis catheter should be cleaned daily, and patients should follow instructions given to them by their dialysis team. Preventive use of antimicrobials have been used to reduce the risk peritonitis; however, if this technique is used, it may generate antibiotic resistant organisms over time. Individuals should discuss how to decrease or prevent the likelihood of peritonitis recurrence with their health-care professional."
What is the prognosis for a person with peritonitis?,"'The prognosis for individuals who develop peritonitis depends on both the underlying cause and how rapidly the disease is treated. The prognosis can range from good to poor. For example, individuals that are treated appropriately with antimicrobials and surgery for peritonitis caused by appendicitis often have a good outcome. However, individuals with long-standing disease such as ''liver failure'' that develop the hepatorenal syndrome and peritonitis have a poor prognosis.' "

What is pernicious anemia?,"'Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have a sufficient number of red blood cells or ''hemoglobin''. Hemoglobin is present within red blood cells and is important for carrying oxygen to all tissues of the body. In males, anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin level of less than 13.5 gram/100ml, while in women, a hemoglobin level of less than 12.0 gram/100ml is considered indicative of anemia. These definitions may vary slightly depending on the source and the laboratory reference used. Pernicious is a term that means destructive, injurious or deadly.''Anemia can result from disruptions in the production of red blood cells or hemoglobin as well as from an increased destruction of red blood cells or loss of blood.''Pernicious anemia is a disease where large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts, which are forerunners of red blood cells) circulate in the blood, and do not function as blood cells; it is a disease caused by impaired uptake of vitamin B-12 due to the lack of intrinsic factor (IF) in the gastric mucosa. It was termed ""pernicious"" because before it was learned that vitamin B-12 could treat the anemia, most people that developed the disease died from it.''Pernicious anemia is due to an inability to absorb vitamin B-12 (also known as cobalamin or Cbl) from the gastrointestinal tract. Humans get vitamin B-12 from animal products; both meat and dairy products are dietary sources of vitamin B-12. The body is able to store vitamin B-12 for a long time, so inadequate dietary intake must persist for years before a true deficiency of vitamin B-12 is reached. Therefore, the symptoms of pernicious anemia usually do not appear for years. While pernicious anemia is most commonly diagnosed in adults with an average age of 60, a rare, congenital (inborn) type of pernicious anemia has been described.''As with other causes of anemia, symptoms related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood can include ''tiredness'' and ''shortness of breath''. Vitamin B-12 deficiency also interferes with the function of the nervous system, and symptoms due to nervous system damage may be apparent even before the anemia is discovered.'""Pernicious anemia is more common in Caucasian persons of northern European ancestry than in other racial groups. Pernicious anemia also is termed Biermer's or Addison's anemia."" "
What is megaloblastic anemia?,"'Sometimes, anemias are subclassified based upon the size and microscopic appearance of the red blood cells. In this regard, pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia refers to an abnormally large type of red blood cell (megaloblast). Megaloblasts are produced in the bone marrow when vitamin B-12 or folic acid levels are low. Megaloblastic anemia also can be caused by other disease of the bone marrow and can be a side effect of some ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' ''drugs''.'  "
What causes pernicious anemia?,"""Pernicious anemia is considered an autoimmune disease, in which the body's own immune system mistakenly damages its own tissues. It is believed that the decreased absorption of vitamin B-12 from the gastrointestinal tract in pernicious anemia results from the presence of an autoantibody against intrinsic factor (IF), a protein made in the stomach that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B-12. Normally, vitamin B-12 binds to intrinsic factor in the stomach, and this facilitates its absorption by the small intestine further along in the digestive process. Along with the autoimmune process that attacks the IF protein and lowers IF levels in stomach secretions, another autoimmune reaction against the stomach lining cells also occurs, resulting in a form of inflammation known as chronic atrophic ""'gastritis''.''Pernicious anemia is sometimes associated with other autoimmune diseases such as '""Graves' disease"""", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'' and ''vitiligo'' (depigmentation or blanching of skin areas).'  "
Is pernicious anemia the same as vitamin B-12 deficiency anemia?,"'No, pernicious anemia is one form of vitamin B-12 deficiency that results from the autoimmune process described previously. However, other causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency also can produce the same signs and symptoms as pernicious anemia. Other potential causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency include surgical removal of the stomach or a portion of the stomach (total or partial gastrectomy), other gastrointestinal diseases such as ''celiac disease'"" or Crohn's disease, infections of the gastrointestinal tract, longstanding use of acid-reducing medications, and poor ""'nutrition''.' "
What are the symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency/pernicious anemia?,"'As discussed previously, true pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune condition that impairs absorption of dietary vitamin B-12, resulting in vitamin B-12 deficiency. Vitamin B-12 deficiency of any cause, including pernicious anemia, will result in anemia and neurologic symptoms. Because the body has large stores of vitamin B-12, a deficiency takes many years to establish.''Vitamin B-12 deficiency affects the nervous system, leading to a variety of symptoms. Sometimes, these may be apparent before symptoms related to the anemia. Neurological symptoms vary and may be nonspecific (meaning that these are symptoms that can be caused by a number of different conditions). Feelings of numbness, tingling, ''weakness'', lack of coordination, clumsiness, impaired memory, and personality changes can all occur. Both sides of the body are usually affected, and the legs are typically more affected than the arms. A severe deficiency can result in more serious neurological symptoms, including severe weakness, ''spasticity'', paraplegia, and fecal and ''urinary incontinence''.''Symptoms of anemia are due to the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Shortness of breath, ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', and ''pale skin'' can all occur with anemia. In anemia, the ''heart'' is placed under ''stress'' since it has to work harder to deliver enough oxygen to body tissues. This can result in ''heart murmurs'', fast heartbeats, arrhythmias, an ''enlarged heart'' (cardiomegaly), or even ''heart failure''. It is important to note that not all people who have vitamin B-12 deficiency and neurological symptoms also will have anemia.''A deficiency of vitamin B-12 also can alter the surface of the tongue, making it appear shiny or smooth.''Finally, sometimes pernicious anemia is diagnosed in a patient with no symptoms. In these cases, it is usually found incidentally when blood tests are ordered for another reason.'  "
What kinds of doctors treat pernicious anemia?,'Pernicious anemia may be treated by internal or family medicine specialists as well as specialists in disorders of the blood (hematologists).' 
How is pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency diagnosed?,"'The first step is always a thorough history and physical examination by a health care practitioner. The results of this examination are used to help direct further testing. A number of laboratory tests are available that can help diagnose pernicious anemia as well as other causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency. These tests include:' A complete blood cell count (CBC) Examination of a blood smear (peripheral smear) under a microscope, often performed in association with a CBC Blood vitamin B-12 level measurements Tests for the presence of autoantibodies to intrinsic factor or stomach lining cells Blood levels of iron and iron-binding capacity Folate levels (which are often reduced when vitamin B-12 levels are low) Blood levels of methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, both of which may be sensitive indicators of vitamin B-12 deficiency The Schilling test, a measure of how well the body can absorb vitamin B-12, is less commonly used today than in the past. Finally, bone marrow aspiration or bone marrow biopsy may be recommended in some cases if bone marrow disorders are suspected"
What is the treatment for pernicious anemia and vitamin B-12 deficiency?,"'The symptoms of pernicious anemia and vitamin B-12 deficiency can be treated by replenishing the vitamin B-12 supply in the body. If a condition other than pernicious anemia is responsible for vitamin B-12 deficiency, treatment also must be directed at the underlying condition. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency may be improved after just a few days of medical treatment.''Vitamin B-12 is typically given as an intramuscular injection (shot). An injection of 1000 micrograms (1 mg) of vitamin B-12 is generally given every day for one week, followed by 1 mg every week for four weeks and then 1 mg every month thereafter.''Alternative treatments for pernicious anemia include high-dose oral vitamin B-12, since a lower-efficiency absorption system for vitamin B-12 exists in the intestine that does not require the presence of IF. However, the oral dose required for this type of therapy (1 to 2 milligrams/day) is more than 200 times higher than the minimum daily vitamin B-12 requirement for adults and is significantly higher than that available in most standard ''multivitamins'' and B-12 ''supplements''. Nasal spray and sublingual (under the tongue) preparations of vitamin B-12 also are available and are under investigation.'  "
Can pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency be prevented?,"'The autoimmune process that causes pernicious anemia cannot be prevented. Vitamin B-12 deficiency that is caused by conditions such as other gastrointestinal diseases and gastrointestinal surgery is preventable only to the extent that these causative conditions themselves are preventable.''Vitamin B-12 is derived from animal (for example, meat, fish, poultry, milk) sources, but vitamin B-12 deficiency in vegetarians or vegans can be prevented by the use of oral vitamin B-12 ''supplements''. An oral dose of 100-200 micrograms (mcg) taken weekly is sufficient. ''Pregnant'' and ''nursing'' women who are vegetarians or vegan should take a B-12 supplement and inform their doctors they are vegetarians or vegan.' "
What is the prognosis for pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency? Can it be cured?,"'If untreated, the neurological complications of pernicious anemia can be permanent and end in death, but pernicious anemia is easily and effectively treated by the administration of vitamin B-12. Life-long treatment is required.''People with pernicious anemia have a slightly increased risk of ''stomach cancer'' when compared to the normal population. The incidence of stomach ''cancer'' in people with pernicious anemia is 2-3 times higher than in the general population of the same age.' "
"What is the difference between antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy, and psychopathy?","'Psychopathy and sociopathy, although not mental health disorders formally recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, are more severe forms of antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, in order for a medical professional to diagnose someone as a psychopath, a person must have a lack of remorse or guilt about their actions in addition to demonstrating antisocial behaviors. Other core symptoms of this condition include a severe lack of caring for others, a lack of emotion, overconfidence, selfishness, and a higher propensity for planned aggression compared to sociopaths or other people with antisocial personality disorder. They are more likely to be able to maintain steady employment and to seem to have normal relationships compared to sociopaths. Mental health providers believe psychopaths are born lacking the ability to feel guilt rather than being associated with a history of ''trauma'' (like abuse, neglect, or exposure to community violence). While statistics indicate that 50%-80% of incarcerated individuals have antisocial personality disorder, only 15% of those convicted criminals have been shown to have the more severe antisocial personality disorder type of psychopathy.'""Psychopaths tend to be highly suspicious or paranoid, even compared to people with antisocial personality disorder. The implications of this suspicious stance can be dire, in that paranoid thoughts (ideations) tend to lead the psychopathic person to interpret all aggressive behaviors toward them, even those that are justified, as being arbitrary and unfair. A televised case study of a psychopath provided a vivid illustration of the resulting psychopathic anger. Specifically, the criminal featured in the story apparently abducted a girl and sexually abused her over the course of a number of days in an attempt to prove to investigating authorities that his stepdaughter's allegations that he sexually abused her were false.""'Although people often use the terms psychopathy and sociopathy interchangeably, researchers describe sociopaths as having a higher tendency toward impulsive behaviors and angry outbursts and if they form any connection to other people it is usually with other sociopaths. They are also less likely to be able to maintain steady employment or to give the appearance of having normal relationships compared to psychopaths.' "
What are causes and risk factors of antisocial personality disorder?,"'One of the most frequently asked questions about antisocial personality disorder by both professionals and laypeople is whether it is genetic. Many wonder if it is hereditary, just as much as hair, eye, or skin color; if this were the case, children of antisocial people would be highly expected to become antisocial themselves, whether or not they live with the antisocial parent. Fortunately, human beings are just not that simple. Like all personality disorders, and most mental disorders, antisocial personality disorder tends to be the result of a combination of biologic/genetic and environmental factors.'""Although there are no clear biological causes for this disorder, studies on the possible neurodevelopmental risk factors for developing antisocial personality disorder reveal that, in those with the illness, the part of the brain that is primarily responsible for learning from one's mistakes and for responding to sad and fearful facial expressions (the amygdala) tends to be smaller and respond less robustly to the happy, sad, or fearful facial expressions of others. That lack of response may have something to do with the lack of empathy that antisocial individuals tend to have with the feelings, rights, and suffering of others. While some individuals may be more vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder because of their particular genetic background, that is thought to be a factor only when the person is also exposed to life events such as abuse or neglect that tend to put the person at risk for development of the disorder. Similarly, while there are some theories about the role of ""'premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS'') and other hormonal fluctuations in the development of antisocial personality disorder, the disorder cannot be explained as the direct result of such problems.''Other conditions that are risk factors for antisocial personality disorder include ''substance abuse'', attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (''ADHD''), ''reading disorder'', or conduct disorder, which is diagnosed in children. People who experience a temporary or permanent brain dysfunction, often also called organic ''brain damage'', are at risk for developing violent or otherwise criminal behaviors. Theories about the life experiences that increase the risk for developing antisocial symptoms in teenagers and adults provide important clues for its ''prevention''. Examples of such life experiences include a history of ''prenatal'' drug exposure or malnutrition, childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect; deprivation or abandonment; associating with peers who engage in antisocial behavior; or a parent who is either antisocial or alcoholic.'  "
What are antisocial personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'To understand antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD), it is necessary to learn what having any personality disorder involves. As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-V'"", 2013), a personality disorder (PD) is a consistent, enduring pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that is significantly different from what is thought to be consistent with the individual's own social and cultural norms.""'Mental health professionals group personality disorders based on a commonality of symptoms.''Cluster A personality disorders are those that include symptoms of social isolation, and/or strange, eccentric behavior. These disorders include''Cluster B personality disorders are those that involve dramatic or erratic behaviors (counter-social behaviors). These personality disorders include''Cluster C personality disorders have difficulties with ''anxiety'' and inhibited behavior. These disorders include''Antisocial personality disorder is specifically a persistent pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others. Called dissocial personality disorder internationally, the United States-based ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') describes antisocial personality disorder as having diagnostic criteria of a pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that must include at least three of the following specific signs and symptoms:''Other important characteristics of this disorder include that medical professionals do not diagnose this disorder in children (individuals younger than 18 years of age), but the affected person must have shown symptoms of this diagnosis (conduct disorder) at least since 15 years of age. Additionally, a medical professional cannot diagnose antisocial personality disorder if the person only shows symptoms of antisocial personality disorder at the same time they are suffering from ''symptoms of schizophrenia'' or of ''bipolar disorder''. Describing ''bipolar disorder'' as one of the exclusion criteria (diagnoses whose presence means that the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder cannot be assigned) is a change from how this disorder was described in the previous diagnostic manual in the United States, the ''DSM-IV-TR'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision''). The ''DSM-IV'' described having a ''manic'' episode as the exclusion criterion with ''schizophrenia'', not having the depressive aspect of ''bipolar disorder'' as an exclusion criterion.''Intermittent explosive disorder is a recognized diagnosis whose symptoms involve aggression that is excessive in response to its trigger. People may mistake its symptoms for those of antisocial personality disorder. ''Misophonia'', a newly described diagnosis not recognized in the ''DSM-V'', has symptoms that include the sufferer responding to being provoked to anger and impulsive aggression by sights or sounds that are innocuous to most people. The aggression of this disorder may also be mistaken for antisocial personality disorder.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to occur in about 1% of women and 3% of men in the United States. Antisocial personality symptoms in women tend to include self-harm and more of the other ''symptoms of borderline personality disorder'' (''BPD'') than in men.'   paranoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder. antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder. avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCD). Repeatedly breaking laws, as evidenced by repeatedly engaging in behaviors that are grounds for arrest (for example, stealing, fire-setting, other destruction of property, assaults) Repeated deceitfulness in relationships with others, such as telling lies, using false names, or conning others for profit or pleasure Failure to think or plan ahead (impulsivity) Tendency to irritability, hostility, anger, and aggressiveness, as shown by repeatedly assaulting others or getting into frequent physical fights Disregard for their own safety or the safety of others, such that they have a lack of self-control and are prone to repeatedly engaging in risk-taking behaviors Persistent lack of taking responsibility, such as failing to establish a pattern of good work habits or keeping financial obligations A disregard for other people such that there is a lack of feeling guilty about wrongdoing"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose antisocial personality disorder?,"""There is no specific definitive test, such as a blood test, that can accurately assess whether a person has antisocial personality disorder. Mental health practitioners like psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, or clinical psychologists conduct a mental health interview that gathers information to look for the presence of the symptoms previously described. Due to the use of a mental health interview in making the diagnosis and the fact that this disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, it is important that the mental health practitioner know to assess the symptoms in the context of the person's culture so the individual is not assessed as having antisocial personality disorder when he or she does not. Unfortunately, research shows that many practitioners lack the knowledge, experience, and sometimes the willingness to factor cultural context into their assessments."" "
What are the treatments for antisocial personality disorder?,"'Another very common question asked is, can antisocial personality disorder be cured? While it can be quite resistant to change, research shows there are a number of effective treatments for this disorder. For example, teenagers who receive therapy that helps them change the thinking that leads to their maladaptive behavior (cognitive behavioral ''psychotherapy'') experience a significant decrease the incidence of engaging in repeat antisocial behaviors.''On the other hand, attempting to treat antisocial personality disorder like other conditions is not often effective. For example, programs that have tried to use a purely reflective (insight-oriented talk therapy) approach to treating ''depression'' or ''eating disorders'' in people with antisocial personality disorder often worsen rather than improve outcomes in those individuals. In those cases, firm but fair behavior therapy to reward appropriate actions and programming that emphasizes teaching individuals with antisocial personality disorder the skills that one can use to live independently and productively within the rules and limits of society has been the more effective treatment for this condition. Family therapy that helps loved ones of people with antisocial personality disorder appropriately cope with the negative behaviors and promote the positive behaviors of the antisocial personality disorder sufferer can also be an important part of treatment for this condition.''While ''clinical trials'' indicate that medications do not directly treat the behaviors that characterize antisocial personality disorder, they can be useful in addressing conditions that co-occur with this condition. Specifically, ''depressed'' or anxious individuals who also have antisocial personality disorder may benefit from ''antidepressants'' like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), or ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), and those who exhibit impulsive anger may improve when given mood stabilizers like ''lithium'', ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), or ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'').'  "
What are complications if antisocial personality disorder is not treated? What is the prognosis of antisocial personality disorder?,"'Some long-term societal costs of antisocial personality disorder, like the suffering endured by victims of the crimes committed by people with this disorder, are clear. However, when people with ASPD are the charismatic leaders of religious cults, the devastation they can create is often not known unless and until a catastrophe occurs. The multiple murders orchestrated by Charles Manson and the mass ''suicide'' that occurred at the command of the Reverend Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978 are just two such examples.''Individuals who suffer from antisocial personality disorder have a higher risk of abusing ''alcohol'' and other ''drugs'' and repeatedly committing crimes. Imprisonment is a potential consequence. People with antisocial personality disorder are also vulnerable to mood problems, such as ''major depression'', ''anxiety'', and bipolar disorder; having other personality disorders, especially borderline (''BPD'') and narcissistic personality disorders; self-mutilation and other forms of self-harm, as well as dying from homicide, suicide, or accident.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to make the prognosis of virtually any other condition more problematic. Having antisocial personality disorder makes the treatment for problems of substance abuse or emotional or physical substance dependence more difficult. People who have both antisocial personality disorder and ''schizophrenia'' are less likely to comply with treatment programs and are more likely to remain institutionalized in a prison or a hospital. These risks amplify if antisocial personality disorder is not treated. Statistics indicate that many people with antisocial personality disorder experience a remission of symptoms by the time they reach 50 years of age.' "

What is whooping cough? What is the history of whooping cough?,"'Whooping cough is a bacterial ''upper respiratory infection'' that leads to episodes of violent coughing. The disease derives its name from the characteristic sound produced when affected individuals attempt to inhale; the ''whoop'' originates from the inflammation and swelling of the laryngeal structures (voice box) that vibrate when there is a rapid inflow of air during inspiration. The whoop in not often appreciated in infants and toddlers but will be recognized in older children, ''teens'', and some adults (rarely). Infants and toddlers are more likely to have recurrent and frequent episodes of violent cough, which may cause facial ''cyanosis'' (blue skin discoloration) and rarely apnea (cessation of ''breathing''). Whooping cough is highly contagious.''Physicians described the first outbreaks of whooping cough in the 16th century. Researchers did not identify the bacterium responsible for the infection, ''Bordetella pertussis'"", until 1906. In the pre-vaccination era (during the 1920s and '30s), there were over 250,000 cases of whooping cough per year in the U.S., with up to 9,000 deaths. In the 1940s, health care professionals introduced the pertussis vaccine, combined with ""'diphtheria'' and ''tetanus'' toxoids (DTP). By 1976, the incidence of whooping cough in the U.S. had decreased by over 99%.''During the 1980s, however, the incidence of whooping cough began to increase and has risen steadily, with epidemics typically occurring every three to five years in the U.S. In the epidemic of 2005, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) reported 25,616 cases of whooping cough. In 2008, over 13,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in the U.S., resulting in 18 deaths. In the 2010 whooping cough outbreak, which included an epidemic in California (see below), there were 27,550 cases of pertussis reported nationwide.''In 2012, health care professionals reported over 48,000 cases of pertussis infection in the U.S., the highest number of reported cases in one year since 1955.'  "
What causes whooping cough?,'A bacterium known as ''Bordetella pertussis'' causes whooping cough infection. The bacteria attach to the lining of the airways in the upper respiratory system and release toxins that lead to inflammation and swelling.''Most people acquire the bacteria by breathing in the bacteria that are present in droplets released when an infected person ''coughs'' or sneezes.' 
Is whooping cough contagious?,'The infection is very contagious is often is spread to infants by family members or caregivers who may be in the early stages of infection and not realize that they are suffering from whooping cough.' 
What is the contagious period for whooping cough?, A person infected with pertussis is highly contagious (can spread the infection to others) from the onset of symptoms to around three weeks after the onset of the coughing episodes. Antibiotic treatment reduces the contagious period to about five days.
What are risk factors for whooping cough?,"'Whooping cough can infect anyone. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable to the infection and its complications, which can include ''pneumonia'' and ''seizures''.' Infants who contract whooping cough may also experience episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing). The infection occurs worldwide, even in countries with well-developed vaccination programs. Adults may develop pertussis because the immunity from childhood vaccinations can wear off over time."
How long does the whooping cough vaccine last?,"'Receiving the vaccine or having the disease does not ensure lifelong protective immunity against pertussis. Immunity to the bacteria decreases after five to 10 years following administration of the vaccine. Therefore older children, adolescents, and adults are at risk of contracting pertussis infection and need revaccination. Vaccinating adults is also important because adults can serve as a source of infection for infants, who are at particular risk of having severe illness and serious complications from pertussis.''People who received the pertussis vaccine and still become ill, however, have a lower risk of complications and often experience less severe symptoms. In most cases, the duration of the cough is shorter and coughing fits are less frequent than in unvaccinated people.' "
What is the incubation period for whooping cough?," 

Read Doctor's View
   The incubation period, or the period from exposure to the causative bacteria and development of symptoms, is longer than that for the common cold and most upper respiratory infections. Typically, signs and symptoms develop within seven to 10 days of exposure to pertussis, but they may not appear for up to three weeks after the initial infection."
"What are whooping cough symptoms, signs, and stages?","'The ''first stage'' of whooping cough is the catarrhal stage. In the catarrhal stage, which typically lasts from one to two weeks, an infected person has ''cold-like symptoms'' (characteristic of an upper ''respiratory infection''), including''It is important to note that particularly during this early phase of infection, individuals may believe they have a ''common cold'' and may not be aware that they have pertussis.''The cough gradually becomes more severe, and after one to two weeks, the second stage begins. It is during the ''second stage'' (the paroxysmal stage) that physicians suspect a diagnosis of whooping cough. The following characteristics describe the second stage:''The ''third stage'' of whooping cough is the recovery or convalescent stage. In the convalescent stage, recovery is gradual. The cough becomes less paroxysmal and usually disappears over two to three weeks; however, paroxysms often recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many months.' runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, and mild, occasional cough, similar to the common cold. There are bursts (paroxysms) of coughing, or numerous rapid coughs, apparently due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the airways in the lungs. Bursts of coughing increase in frequency during the first one to two weeks, remain constant for two to three weeks, and then gradually begin to decrease in frequency. At the end of the bursts of rapid coughs, a long inspiratory effort (breathing in) usually accompanies a characteristic high-pitched whoop sound for which the disease is named. During an attack, the individual may become cyanotic (skin and mucous membranes may turn blue) from lack of oxygen. Children and young infants appear especially ill and distressed. Vomiting (referred to by doctors as post-tussive vomiting) and exhaustion commonly follow the episodes of coughing. The person usually appears normal between episodes. Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night, with an average of 15-24 attacks per 24 hours. The paroxysmal stage usually lasts from one to six weeks but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Infants under 6 months of age may not have the strength to have a whoop, but they do have paroxysms of coughing."
How long does whooping cough last?," It can take up to three weeks after exposure to develop symptoms, although symptoms usually develop within five to 10 days after infection. The paroxysmal stage, characterized by the coughing fits, usually lasts from one to six weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks. The third and final stage (convalescent stage) lasts about two to three weeks."
What does whooping cough sound like?," As mentioned above, the characteristic cough of pertussis occurs in the second or paroxysmal stage of the illness. There is a series or burst of rapid coughs. At the end of these coughs, a long inspiratory effort (breathing in) is usually accompanied by a high-pitched whoop sound for which the disease is named."
How do people transmit whooping cough?," Whooping cough is highly contagious and spreads among people by direct contact with fluids from the nose or mouth of infected people. People contaminate their hands with respiratory secretions from an infected person and then touch their own mouth or nose. In addition, small bacteria-containing droplets of mucus from the nose or lungs enter the air during coughing or sneezing. People become infected by breathing in these drops."
Can adults get whooping cough?,"'Although whooping cough is considered an illness of childhood, adults may also develop the disease even if they were vaccinated as children. Because immunity from the pertussis vaccine decreases over time but does not necessarily disappear, adults who do become infected may have retained a partial degree of immunity against the infection that results in a milder illness. Although the illness usually is milder in adults than in children, the duration of the paroxysmal cough lasts just as long as in children. Doctors notice the characteristic whoop that occurs after paroxysmal bouts of coughing in only 20%-40% of adults with whooping cough.''Whooping cough in adults is more common than usually appreciated, accounting for up to 7% of adult illnesses that cause coughing each year. Infected adults are a reservoir (source) of infection for children, so it is particularly important that all family members and caregivers of young infants receive pertussis vaccinations.' "
What specialists treat whooping cough?,"'Primary care providers, including' internists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, and in some cases, infectious-disease specialists, may treat pertussis."
How do health care professionals diagnose whooping cough?,"'When a patient has the typical symptoms of whooping cough, doctors can make the diagnosis from the clinical history. However, the disease and its symptoms, including its severity, can vary among affected individuals.' Laboratory tests may be necessary in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain or a doctor wants to confirm the diagnosis. Culture of the bacterium Bordetella pertussis from nasal secretions can establish the diagnosis. Another test used to successfully identify the bacterium and diagnose whooping cough is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that can identify genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions."
What is the treatment for whooping cough?,"'Antibiotics directed against ''Bordetella pertussis'' can be effective in reducing the severity of whooping cough when administered early in the course of the disease. Antibiotic therapy can also help reduce the risk of transmission of the bacterium to other household members as well as to others who may encounter an infected person. Unfortunately, physicians diagnose most people with whooping cough later with the condition in the second (paroxysmal) stage of the disease.''Antibiotics are the recommended treatment for anyone who has had the disease for less than three to four weeks. ''Azithromycin'' (''Zithromax''), ''clarithromycin'' (''Biaxin''), ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone), and ''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'', ''Septra'') are antibiotics that have been shown to be effective in treating whooping cough. It is unclear whether antibiotics have any benefit for people who have been ill with whooping cough for longer than three to four weeks, although doctors still consider antibiotic therapy for this group. There is no proven effective treatment for the paroxysms of coughing that accompany whooping cough.''Health care professionals routinely administer antibiotics to people who have had close contact with an infected person, regardless of their vaccination status.''Do not give an infected child ''over-the-counter'' or prescription cough syrup or cough medicines unless instructed to do so by a doctor. They may cause sedation that leads to worsened outcomes.' "
What is the prognosis for whooping cough?,"'The infection gradually resolves over a period of weeks, but the coughing paroxysms can persist for several months.''Data indicate that secondary pneumonia occurs in about one out of every 20 infants with whooping cough, and one out of 100 affected infants develop convulsions. Most deaths from whooping cough have occurred in unvaccinated children or in those who are too young to have received the vaccine.' The prognosis is worse when complications such as bacterial pneumonia develop in a person with whooping cough. Young infants are at highest risk of serious complications and even death from whooping cough."
What are possible complications of whooping cough?,"'The most common and life-threatening complication and the cause of most whooping cough-related deaths is secondary bacterial pneumonia. (Secondary bacterial pneumonia is bacterial pneumonia that follows another infection of the lung, be it viral or bacterial. A different virus or bacterium than the original infection causes secondary pneumonia.) Young infants are at the highest risk for whooping cough and for its associated complications, including secondary pneumonia.''Other possible complications of whooping cough, particularly in infants less than 6 months of age, include' seizures, encephalopathy (the abnormal function of the brain due to decreased oxygen delivery to the brain caused by episodes of coughing), reactive airway disease (asthma), dehydration, hearing loss, and malnutrition. Other complications reported in adults include weight loss, loss of bladder control, and rib fractures from coughing."
Is there a whooping cough vaccine?,"'Whooping cough commonly affects infants and young children. Immunization with the pertussis vaccine prevents the infection.''For maximum protection against pertussis, children need five DTaP shots. Doctors give the first three vaccinations at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Physicians give the fourth vaccination between 15-18 months of age, and a fifth is given when a child enters school, at 4-6 years of age.'""Preteens going to the doctor for their regular checkup at 11 or 12 years of age should get a dose of the Tdap booster, and adults who didn't get Tdap as a preteen or teen should get one dose of Tdap. The easiest way for adults to ensure immunity is to get the Tdap vaccine instead of their next regular tetanus booster. (People should receive the Tdap shot every 10 years.)""'The vaccine is safe for ''pregnant'' women. To protect their infants, most pregnant women not previously vaccinated with Tdap should get one dose of Tdap during the late ''second trimester'' or ''third trimester'' of ''pregnancy''. The CDC recommends that women get the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy. If not administered during pregnancy, women should get the vaccine postpartum before leaving the hospital or birthing center. Being vaccinated with Tdap is especially important for mothers and families with new infants as well as all people caring for newborns. When a woman receives the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy, the antibodies she develops to the'' Bordetella pertussis'' bacterium transfer to the infant, providing some additional protection to the infant before the baby can be fully vaccinated.'  Physicians commonly give the pertussis vaccine in combination with the vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus. DTaP (Pertussis is the ""P"" in the DTaP) combination inoculation routinely given to children, and Tdap (the ""p"" in the Tdap) vaccine administered to adolescents and adults.  Since immunity from the pertussis vaccine wears off with time, many teenagers and adults get whooping cough."

What is whooping cough? What is the history of whooping cough?,"'Whooping cough is a bacterial ''upper respiratory infection'' that leads to episodes of violent coughing.

Introduction to pervasive developmental disorders,"'The term ""pervasive development disorders,"" also called PDDs, refers to a group of conditions that involve delays in the development of many basic skills, most notably the ability to socialize with others, to communicate, and to use imagination. Children with these conditions often are confused in their thinking and generally have problems understanding the world around them.'""Because these conditions typically are identified in children around 3 years of age -- a critical period in a child's development -- they are called development disorders. Although the condition begins far earlier than 3 years of age, parents often do not notice a problem until the child is a toddler who is not ""'walking'', talking, or developing as well as other children of the same age.' "
What Conditions Are Considered Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'There are five types of pervasive development disorders:' Autism: Children with autism have problems with social interaction, pretend play, and communication. They also have a limited range of activities and interests. Many (nearly 75%) of children with autism also have some degree of mental retardation. Asperger's syndrome: Like children with autism, children with Asperger's syndrome have difficulty with social interaction and communication, and have a narrow range of interests. However, children with Asperger's have average or above average intelligence, and develop normally in the areas of language and cognition (the mental processes related to thinking and learning). Children with Asperger's often also have difficulty concentrating and may have poor coordination. Childhood disintegrative disorder: Children with this rare condition begin their development normally in all areas, physical and mental. At some point, usually between 2 and 10 years of age, a child with this illness loses many of the skills he or she has developed. In addition to the loss of social and language skills, a child with disintegrative disorder may lose control of other functions, including bowel and bladder control. Rett's syndrome: Children with this very rare disorder have the symptoms associated with a PDD and also suffer problems with physical development. They generally suffer the loss of many motor or movement, skills -- such as walking and use of their hands -- and develop poor coordination. This condition has been linked to a defect on the X chromosome, so it almost always affects girls. Pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS): This category is used to refer to children who have significant problems with communication and play, and some difficulty interacting with others, but are too social to be considered autistic."
What Are the Symptoms of Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The use of the word ""pervasive"" to describe these illnesses is somewhat misleading. The definition of pervasive is ""to be present throughout,"" but children with PDDs generally do not have problems in all areas of functioning. Rather, most children with PDDs have specific problem areas and often function very well in other areas.''Children with PDDs, such as autism, can display a wide range of symptoms which can range in severity from mild to disabling. They also vary widely in their individual abilities, intelligence, and behavior.''General symptoms that may be present to some degree in a child with a PDD include:'   Difficulty with verbal communication, including problems using and understanding language. Difficulty with non-verbal communication, such as gestures and facial expressions. Difficulty with social interaction, including relating to people and to his or her surroundings. Unusual ways of playing with toys and other objects. Difficulty adjusting to changes in routine or familiar surroundings. Repetitive body movements or patterns of behavior, such as hand flapping, spinning and, head banging. Changing response to sound. (The child may be very sensitive to some noises and seem to not hear others.) Temper tantrums Difficulty sleeping Aggressive behavior Fearfulness or anxiety (nervousness)"
What Causes Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The cause of pervasive development disorders is not known, but researchers are looking for answers. Some studies suggest that PDDs are caused by a problem with the nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Studies currently in progress are examining the structure and function of the brain in people with autism for clues that may help us better understand these conditions, as well as how to treat and/or prevent them.' "
How Common Are Pervasive Development Disorders?,"""It is estimated that pervasive development disorders occur in about five to 15 children per 10,000 births. In general, PDDs are more common in boys than in girls, with the exception of Rett's syndrome, which occurs almost always in girls."" "
How Are Pervasive Development Disorders Diagnosed?,"'If symptoms of a pervasive development disorder are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no laboratory tests to diagnose a PDD, the doctor may use various tests -- such as ''X-rays'' and blood tests -- to determine if there is a physical disorder causing the symptoms.''If no physical disorder is found, the child may be referred to a specialist in childhood development disorders, such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, pediatric ''neurologist'"", developmental pediatrician, or other health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat PDDs. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on the child's level of development, and the doctor's observation of the child's speech and behavior, including his or her play and ability to socialize with others. The doctor often seeks input from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults who are familiar with the child's symptoms."" "
How Are Pervasive Development Disorders Treated?,"""Because children with pervasive development disorders have a range of symptoms and abilities, a plan of therapy must be developed with the child's specific needs in mind. The treatment plan -- or more appropriately, a program of intervention -- will address the child's needs at home and at school. For that reason, intervention planning is a cooperative effort of the parents, health care providers, teachers, and others who may be needed to provide services, such as counselors, social workers and occupational, physical, or speech therapists. The plan aims to promote better socializing and communication, and reduce behaviors that can interfere with learning and functioning.""'A plan of care for a child with a PDD may include:' Special education: Education is structured to meet the child's unique educational needs. Behavior modification: This may include strategies for supporting positive behavior by the child. Speech, physical or occupational therapy: These therapies are designed to increase the child's functional abilities. Medication: There are no drugs to treat the PDDs themselves. Medications may be used, however, treating specific symptoms such as anxiety (nervousness), hyperactivity, and behavior may result in injury."
What Research Is Being Done on Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'Most of the research being done on pervasive development disorders focuses on learning more about the causes of these disorders, specifically what is going on in the brain. The goal is to use this knowledge to develop better techniques for diagnosing and treating these disorders, ultimately leading to ''prevention'' and cure.' "
What Is the Outlook for People with Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The outlook varies depending on the type and severity of the pervasive development disorder, the age at which treatment is started, and the availability of supportive resources for the child. Most children with PDDs will continue to have some problems with communication and socialization, but many can experience a significant increase in function.' "
Can Pervasive Development Disorders Be Prevented?,"'Until more is known about the causes of pervasive development disorders, it is not possible to prevent them. However, the sooner a child with symptoms begins treatment, the better he or she will do in the long run.' "
What is flatfoot?,"'When the entire sole of the foot is in contact or near contact with the ground while standing, it is considered a flat foot. The result is that there is little to no arch to the foot. Flatfoot is a common disorder. It is a complex deformity, and there are types and stages that vary in degree of symptoms and disability. Flatfeet are also referred to as pes planus, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, and fallen arches.' "
What are the different types of flatfoot?,"'There are two general types of flatfoot: flexible flatfoot and rigid flatfoot. In flexible flatfoot, the foot has a normal arch at rest (not standing or ''walking''), but it disappears once it comes in contact with the ground. If there is no arch, whether sitting or standing, they have a ""rigid"" or ""true"" flatfoot.''Flexible flatfoot is sometimes called ""pediatric flatfoot"" because it is first apparent in childhood. Congenital or rigid ""true flatfoot"" (talipes planovalgus) is much less common in children. Of note, almost all infants appear to have a flatfoot due to the fat pad on the sole of their ''feet'' and that the arch does not develop until 5 or 6 years of age.''When a rigid flatfoot develops in adults, it is called ""adult acquired flatfoot"" or ""posterior tibial tendon dysfunction."" This type of flatfoot develops because of the weakening of the tibialis posterior muscle tendon, which is a major supporting structure of the foot arch. It is a condition that leads to flattening of the arch and rolling in of the ankle. It is a progressive deformity with early symptoms of ''pain'' and swelling at the inside arch of the foot and ankle. It eventually may lead to ''arthritis'' of the foot and ankle joints.''Flexible flatfoot is usually in both ''feet'' whereas posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or adult acquired flatfoot can occur in one or both feet.' "
What are other causes of flatfoot?,"'As described above, a person may be born with a flatfoot, pediatric flexible flatfoot, or develop it as an adult (adult acquired flatfoot). Less common causes of flatfoot include the following:'   Tarsal coalitions: A condition where foot joints bridge or grow together restricting or prohibiting movement of that joint. Accessory navicular bone (os tibiale externum): a small extra bone in the posterior tibial tendon that causes a weakening of tendinous support to the arch Ligament laxity in congenital diseases such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Charcot arthropathy Trauma Obesity Diabetes Neuropathy Age Pregnancy, due to hormonal changes such as increases in elastin Osteoporosis Overuse"
What are flatfoot symptoms and signs?,"'A flatfoot may cause no symptoms. Symptoms of flatfoot include ''pain'' that may be in the inside arch, heel, or ankle and on the outside of the foot just below the ankle. Patients often complain of generalized foot ''fatigue'' as a first signs of flatfoot. Younger patients may complain their inability to keep up with their peers during physical activity. Over time, the flattening of the arch can lead to rolling in of the foot and ankle and tilting outward of the heel. Flatfoot can also cause shin ''pain'' (''shin splints'') and aching of the knee, hip, and/or lower back. Excessive inner heel wear pattern may be seen on shoes.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose flatfoot?,"'One may look at their feet to see if they have an arch when standing barefoot for a general assessment. A foot specialist will provide an in-depth evaluation usually including ''X-rays'' to determine the precise type of flatfoot, its cause, and potential treatments. A doctor may perform a thorough study of ''walking'' pattern, called gait analysis, to determine the severity of flatfoot.' "
What is the treatment for flatfoot?,"""Treatment depends on the type of flatfoot, its stage of progression, and the symptoms. Early treatment is advised whether one's condition is a flexible, rigid, or adult acquired flatfoot. Treatments include proper shoe gear, ""'over-the-counter'' inserts, custom functional orthotics, bracing, casting/immobilization, physical therapy, ''NSAIDs'', ''weight loss'', changes in activities, and surgery.' "
What is the prognosis of flatfoot?,"'Prognosis depends on the type and severity of the flatfoot. Many people with pediatric or flexible flatfoot function without any signs or symptoms and are unrestricted in their levels of activity. These people do perfectly well without any treatments. If there are symptoms, however, they are often successfully managed with conservative care. Adult acquired flatfoot or true rigid flatfoot tends to be progressive, leading to functional disability and progression of symptoms that interfere with normal daily activities. Therefore, proper diagnosis and early treatment is vital to having a good prognosis.' "
What is Peyronie's disease?,"""Peyronie's disease (also termed Peyronie disease) is the development of scar tissue inside the penis that causes the penis to develop abnormal curvature (contracture) in the scarred area. The disease may occur in about 1% to 8% of men, most frequently in men aged about 40 to 70 years old. The disease also may occur more frequently with men who\xa0develop:""'Occasionally, the disease\xa0can occur in younger men.'   Prostate cancer High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes"
What are the symptoms of Peyronie's disease?,"""The symptoms of Peyronie's disease usually are a combination of one or more symptoms as follows:""   Unusual angulation of the penile shaft (either when flaccid or erect or both) Pain during erections and/or during sex Scarring or plaque palpated at the abnormal bend or angle of the penis An indentation of the penis shaft at the site of the plaque or scarring Erectile dysfunction Anxiety/stress Inability to have intercourse"
What causes Peyronie's disease?,"""The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is not known. However, whatever can cause plaque or scar formation in the penile shaft is a likely causal candidate. Researchers have suggested several possible agents such as vitamin E deficiency, beta-blocking medications, elevations in serotonin, and genetic causes. Some researchers think that minor vascular traumas to the penis (during sex, athletic or ""'exercise'' endeavors) that occur repeatedly over time may lead to scar formation. None of these possible agents or processes is proven to be the cause to date.'  "
What are the phases of Peyronie's disease?,"""There are, in general, two phases of Peyronie's disease."" The acute phase lasts about 18 to 24 months and usually has the highest pain component. The chronic phase (begins at about 18 to 24 months after first symptoms) usually has less pain but in this stage, the plaque or scarring is more refractory to treatment (see below) and may begin to develop large calcium deposits (calcified plaque or scarring)."
What procedures and tests diagnose Peyronie's disease?,"""The patient's history of pain with erections and/or sex and the physical examination of the penis that shows abnormal angulation of the penile shaft or the presence of plaque or scarring felt or palpated in the penis is usually the basis for diagnosis. Urologists are specialists who usually diagnose and treat this disease. There are no definitive blood tests for this disease, although a human cell antigen, HLA-B7 has been associated with the disease. In general, no additional tests are necessary, but ""'ultrasound'' techniques, when accompanied by an injection of drug into the penis (intercavernous injection) can help show the doctor where and how extensive is the scarring, and aid the doctor in determining treatments.' "
What is the treatment for Peyronie's disease?,"""Several types of treatments are designed to reduce the symptoms of Peyronie's disease.""  "
"Medications, home remedies, vitamins, and supplements","'In December, 2013, the FDA approved ''collagenase clostridium histolyticum'' (''Xiaflex'"") to treat individuals with Peyronie's disease. Each treatment cycle consists of two Xiaflex injections into the plaque in the penis to break up the collagen that causes the curvature deformity. Treatments consist of a maximum four injections.""'Oral therapy with vitamin E, ''colchicine'', PABA, ''tamoxifen'', and other medications have been tried with limited success in some patients. Usually those in the acute phase of the disease responded best.''In the early stages of the disease, erectile dysfunction (''ED'') may be treated with such drugs as ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra''), and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis'', Adcirca).''Injection therapy uses combinations of drugs mentioned above and adds prostaglandin E1 or other drugs such as betamethasone alone or with hyaluronidase; PABA has been reported to reduce the penile plaque size.''Other drugs have also been used with varying degree of success. ''Verapamil'' (''Calan'', ''Verelan'', Verelan PM, ''Isoptin'', Isoptin SR, ''Covera-HS'' [a medication usually used for ''high blood pressure treatment'""]) appears to disrupt the production of a protein involved in the formation of Peyronie's disease lesions.""'Another method is iontophoresis (also termed electromotive administration or EMDA) where verapamil and other drugs are applied to the penile skin and pushed through the skin with a low electrical current.' "
Shockwave therapy,"'Shockwave therapy (done with a lithotripter device like those used to break up ''kidney stones'') has been used on plaque or scaring that is calcified. Other mechanical devices, including vacuum-based machines and low-dose radiotherapy have been tried. Although some successes are seen with these methods, best results are in acute phase patients. There are ongoing studies with different drugs (for example, interferons, and collagenase) and surgical techniques.' "
Surgery,"""Surgical therapy is done on some patients. These surgical patients usually have to meet criteria that may vary from surgeon to surgeon. In general, surgical therapy is done when other methods have failed or the patient is in the chronic stage of the disease and erectile dysfunction is part of the patient's symptoms. Surgical therapy may involve incision or cutting the scarred tissue, scar tissue removal, scar tissue removal with auto-grafting or artificial graft material. In addition, implanted devices (penile implant) that allow the patient to sustain an erection are also utilized in some individuals."" "
Can exercises help Peyronie's disease?,'Some individuals suggest stretching and/or milking the penis are exercises that can help reduce the penile curvature that occurs in the disease. Patients should discuss these techniques with their doctor (''urologist'') before using these methods.' 
What are the complications of Peyronie's disease?,"'The complications of the disease are mainly the symptoms of:''In addition, surgical complications may include:''Depression'' and stress can become significant complications.'   Pain Painful intercourse Inability to have intercourse due to pain or erectile dysfunction Permanent angulation of the penis Reduction in penis length Infections Loss of any erectile functions"
What is the prognosis for Peyronie's disease? Can it be cured?,"""The prognosis (outcome) of this disease is variable, from good to poor, depending on the response to treatment and the patient's emotional response to the symptoms and treatments.\xa0There is no treatment that will cure Peyronie's disease, but symptoms can be reduced."" "
What is Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis) and other ''birth defects'' in the hands and feet. The abnormality of the skull bones causes changes in the shape of the face and head. There are three subtypes of the syndrome, with Types II and II being the most severe. ''Pfeiffer syndrome has also been referred to as acrocephalosyndactyly type V, ACSV, craniofacial-skeletal-dermatologic syndrome, and Noack syndrome.' "
What causes Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning that only a single copy of an abnormal gene is necessary to cause the condition. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either parent or be a result of a new mutation (change in a gene) in the affected individual. Almost all cases of Pfeiffer syndrome type II and type III originate from new mutations because the parents are unaffected.' Pfeiffer syndrome type I is associated with mutations in genes known as FGFR1 
and FGFR2.  Pfeiffer syndrome type II and type III are associated with mutations 
in FGFR2. Older age in the father is a known risk factor for acquiring Pfeiffer 
syndrome in the offspring due to new mutations."
What are the signs and symptoms of Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Signs and symptoms of Pfeiffer syndrome include:''People with Type I Pfeiffer syndrome typically have normal intelligence. Types II and III of Pfeiffer syndrome are more severe. People with types II and III of Pfeiffer syndrome usually have problems with brain development. This can cause limitation of brain growth and developmental delays.' Bulging eyes Wide-set eyes High forehead Beaked nose Underdevelopment of the upper jaw Prominent lower jaw Protrusion of the eyes Hearing loss (in over 50% of those 
affected) Short fingers and toes (brachydactyly) Webbing or fusion between the digits 
(syndactly) Dental problems Wide thumbs and big toes that bend away 
from the other digits Cloverleaf-shaped head (in Type II 
Pfeiffer syndrome)"
How common is Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome affects around 1 out of every 100,000 people.' "
How is Pfeiffer syndrome diagnosed?,"'Pfeiffer syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of the characteristic birth defects. If the diagnosis is uncertain, genetic testing can be done to identify changes in the FGFR1 and/or FGFR2 genes.' "
Is there any treatment for Pfeiffer syndrome?,"""There is no treatment that can reverse Pfeiffer syndrome, but treatments are available that address each individual's specific symptoms. Treatments may be needed from a variety of specialists, including surgeons, pediatricians, otolaryngologists (ENT specialists), neurologists, or others. Reconstructive surgeries can help overcome some of the physical defects associated with the syndrome."" "
What other disorders are related to Pfeiffer syndrome?,"'There is a spectrum of disorders associated with changes to the FGFR genes that results in facial defects. These conditions include Pfeiffer syndrome and the following:' Apert syndrome Crouzon syndrome Beare-Stevenson syndrome FGFR2-related isolated coronal 
synostosis Jackson-Weiss syndrome Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis 
nigricans (AN) Muenke syndrome"
What is the life expectancy of an individual with Pfeiffer syndrome?,'Most people with Type I Pfeiffer syndrome have a normal life span. People with Types II and III have severe disease and may develop complications that shorten their life expectancy.' 
What is pulmonary hypertension?,"'Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries increases abnormally. To help explain this condition further, here is how the pulmonary arteries work.''The ''human body'' has two major sets of blood vessels that distribute blood from the heart to the body. One set pumps blood from the right heart to the lungs, and the other from the ''left heart'' to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). When a doctor or a nurse measures the ''blood pressure'"" on a person's arm, he/she is measuring the pressures in the systemic circulation. When these pressures are abnormally high, the person is diagnosed as having ""'high blood pressure'' (systemic hypertension).''The portion of the circulation that distributes the blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and back to the left side of the heart is referred to as the pulmonary (lung) circulation.''The ''right ventricle'' pumps blood returning from the body into the pulmonary arteries to the lungs to receive oxygen. The pressures in the lung arteries (pulmonary arteries) are normally significantly lower than the pressures in the systemic circulation. When pressure in the pulmonary circulation becomes abnormally elevated, it is referred to as pulmonary hypertension. This most commonly occurs when the pulmonary venous pressure is elevated, so-called pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH). This pressure is transmitted back to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries. The result is elevated pulmonary pressure throughout the pulmonary circulation. Some of this is a direct pressure transmission from the venous system backward and some can result from a reactive constriction of the pulmonary arteries.''Less commonly, pulmonary hypertension results from constriction, or stiffening, of the pulmonary arteries that supply blood to the lungs, so-called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).''Whether it is pulmonary venous or pulmonary arterial hypertension, it becomes more difficult for the heart to pump blood forward through the lungs. This ''stress'' on the heart leads to enlargement of the right heart, and eventually fluid can build up in the liver and other tissues, such as the in the legs.''When the heart pumps blood, it is referred to as systole, and when the heart fills with blood it is referred to as diastole. Normal pulmonary artery pressures range from an upper pressure (systolic) of 15-30 mmHg and a lower pressure (diastolic) of 4-12 mmHg. These values can be obtained approximately by an\xa0''ultrasound'' of the heart (echocardiogram), and more accurately using a catheter to measure the pressures in the pulmonary circulation (right heart catheterization).'  "
What causes pulmonary hypertension?,"'There are many causes of pulmonary hypertension. Often more than one mechanism is involved in a specific disease process. This can also change as the disease progresses.''Primary pulmonary hypertension has no identifiable underlying cause. This term is mainly a historical name and no longer used. The current term used to describe this condition is idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is more common in young people and more common in females than males.''Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unusually is an aggressive and often fatal form of pulmonary hypertension. Whereas it is known that the arterial obstruction is caused by a building up of the smooth muscle cells that line the arteries, the underlying cause of the disease has long been a mystery.'""A genetic cause of the familial form of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, now referred to as Heritable PAH, has been discovered. It is caused by mutations in a gene called BMPR2. BMPR2 encodes a receptor (a transforming growth factor beta type II receptor) that sits on the surface of cells and binds molecules of the TGF-beta superfamily. Binding triggers conformational changes that are shunted down into the cell's interior where a series of biochemical reactions occur, ultimately affecting the cell's behavior. The mutations block this process. This discovery may provide a means of genetic diagnosis and a potential target for the therapy of people with familial (and possibly also sporadic) primary pulmonary hypertension."" Diseases that affect flow out of the heart to the rest of the body result in backflow of blood (stacking of blood) that raises pulmonary venous pressures leading to pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is the process in which the lung vessels narrow in attempt to divert blood from poorly functioning segments of the lung. For instance, when pneumonia develops, a portion of lung becomes inflamed and works poorly in performing the functions of the lung (to add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the blood). This process diverts blood from these poorly working areas and sends it to better functioning lung tissue. However, a problem develops when all the blood has a low oxygen level (hypoxia). This causes constriction of the vessels on the pulmonary arterial side and hence raises the pressure. Remodeling of blood vessels also occurs in some diseases whereby the inner lining (lumen) of the vessel becomes narrowed due to inappropriate growth of the tissue within and around the vessel. Masses and scarring from other diseases can compress and narrow vessels causing increased resistance to flow resulting in elevation of pressures. In a fairly common parasitic infection in the Middle East (schistosomiasis), the blood vessels in the lung become blocked by the parasites causing pulmonary artery hypertension. Some substances cause constriction of the blood vessels. Pulmonary hypertension has been rarely reported with the use of anti-obesity drugs, such as dexfenfluramine (Redux) and Fen/Phen. These medications have seen been removed from the market. Some street drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines, can cause severe pulmonary hypertension. Some diseases raise pulmonary pressures to cause pulmonary artery hypertension for unclear reasons. Perhaps an unknown toxin or chemical effects the blood vessels by causing constriction or inappropriate growth of the tissue within or around the vessel. For example, there is a condition known as portopulmonary hypertension that is a result of liver failure. When these individuals receive a liver transplant, the pulmonary hypertension disappears suggesting that the failing liver is unable to clear some biochemical that leads to pulmonary artery hypertension."
Which diseases are common in people with the condition?,"'There are no clear statistical data on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. Since pulmonary hypertension is seen in multiple different conditions, it is perhaps better to look at the prevalence in each condition. It is fairly common in patients with ''heart failure'', ''COPD'', and ''sleep apnea''. It occurs in 7% to 12% of patients with ''collagen vascular disease'', and in less than 5% of ''HIV'' patients.' "
Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension,"'Many people with pulmonary hypertension may have no symptoms at all, especially if the disease is mild or in the early stages.''Pulmonary hypertension symptoms may include:''Signs of pulmonary hypertension may include:'   Shortness of breath that worsens with activity Other common complaints are cough, fatigue, dizziness, and lethargy. With the advancement of the condition and ensuing right heart failure, shortness of breath may become worse and retention of fluid in the body may increase (due to failure of the heart to pump blood forward) resulting in swelling in the legs. People may also complain of chest pain and angina. Depending on the underlying associated disease, pulmonary artery hypertension can have other manifestations. For example, characteristic skin changes seen in scleroderma, or the signs of liver disease seen in portopulmonary hypertension. Rapid breathing, hypoxia (low oxygen level in the blood), and swelling in the legs. In severe pulmonary hypertension, the health care professional may hear louder than normal components of heart sounds when he or she listens to the heart with a stethoscope (auscultation). The doctor may also feel elevation of the chest wall when the heart pumps and this may indicate enlargement of the right side of the heart suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular heave)."
Classification of primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension,"'The conventional classification, primary (idiopathic) and secondary pulmonary hypertension, which also is called pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been reclassified and is now based on the main underlying cause, characteristics, and treatments of pulmonary hypertension. These terms were updated in 2013. This system classifies the condition based on five classes.''Pulmonary arterial hypertension including idiopathic previously referred to as primary pulmonary arterial hypertension), ''inherited'' pulmonary arterial hypertension, drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension''Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the following:''Pulmonary hypertension due to left ''heart disease'':''Pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (low oxygen levels). This includes:'""Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (chronic blood clots to the lungs that don't dissolve, also termed CTEPH).""'Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms, for example:'  Connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, or scleroderma HIV Liver disease (elevated pressures in the liver, portal hypertension); Congenital heart disease Schistosomiasis (a parasite infection that can clog the pulmonary arteries) Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (very rare) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn An elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure because of increased pulmonary venous pressure backing up into the lungs Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction Valvular heart disease Some congenital/acquired heart diseases Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) Interstitial lung diseases Sleep apnea Chronic exposure to high altitudes Congenital lung disease Blood disorders (including hemolytic anemias) Systemic disorders (such as sarcoid) Metabolic disorders where cellular chemistry is abnormal (such as glycogen storage diseases) Tumors, fibrosis, and other problems obstructing blood flow through the lungs"
Which types of doctors treat pulmonary hypertension?,"'Generally, pulmonary physicians (pulmonologists) and cardiologists treat pulmonary hypertension. Depending on the cause, other physicians also may be involved, such as ''sleep'' medicine doctors, ''rheumatologists'', and perhaps even infectious disease specialists. Today, more health care professionals in the community are becoming adept at managing pulmonary hypertension. However, it is reasonable to get a second opinion regarding management at a tertiary, university setting, because the field of management of pulmonary artery hypertension is evolving rapidly.' "
How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed?,"'The first step in diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is to clinically suspect it. This may be done as part of an evaluation of another disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension (such as scleroderma or ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'""), or based on patients'\xa0signs and symptoms as described above.""'Pulmonary hypertension is defined as the mean pulmonary artery blood pressure greater than 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) measured by right heart catheterization. The pressures can be much higher than 25 mmHg in some people. Therefore, the pulmonary hypertension can be labeled as mild, moderate, or severe based on the pressures. Mean arterial pressure calculated by multiplying the diagnostic pressure two times, and adding the systolic pressure to that number, and then divide by three (systolic is the upper number and diastolic is the lower number in measuring blood pressure). Normally, the pulmonary blood pressure is a much lower pressure system than the systemic blood pressure (which is usually measured with a blood pressure cuff).''Other tests available for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension include ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG''), ''chest X-ray'', and echocardiogram. An ECG may show some abnormalities that may be suggestive of right heart failure. Chest X-ray may also show enlargement of the chambers of the right heart. And echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) shows ultrasound images of the heart and can detect evidence of right heart failure and, with the use of Doppler, (as described previously) can estimate pressures in the pulmonary artery. These tests, in the right clinical setting, are very useful in diagnosing and managing pulmonary hypertension.''Other tests may be useful in evaluating the conditions leading to secondary pulmonary hypertension. For example, a ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) can suggest blood clots in the pulmonary arteries or sometimes a ''CT scan'' of the chest can be used. The chest CT scan can detect pulmonary arterial clots, but also can show abnormalities of the lung tissue and surrounding structures that can contribute to pulmonary hypertension.''Pulmonary function testing can be useful in diagnosing ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD), and other lung diseases, and monitoring disease progression. This test can be used to detect many aspects of lung function including airflow and evidence of obstruction, lung volumes, and the capacity for the lung to extract oxygen from the air.''Sleep'' studies can confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and its severity and management options such as ''CPAP'' therapy.' Many tests, such as echocardiogram, may be performed that may give clues to the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. It is important that a Doppler study be performed with the echocardiogram, which enables the doctor to approximate the pulmonary artery pressures. These values are calculated based on the sound quality of the wave approaching and leaving the echocardiogram machine sensor/probe. This is based on the principle that explains why the sound of an approaching and then passing train varies. But the gold standard (the best test available) is right heart catheterization. This test entails inserting a catheter through the groin into the femoral vein, a large vein in the lower body (or under the collar bone or in the upper arm or neck into a large vein in the upper body) and advancing it to the right side of the heart. The catheter is connected to a device that can monitor and measure blood pressure in the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries.During right heart catheterization, oxygen levels are measured during various positions of the catheter in the pulmonary circulation. This can help determine if a congenital or acquired hole has formed in the heart contributing to the elevated pulmonary pressures. Certain medications or activities can be administered or performed during the procedure to help with the assessment. Nitric oxide can be inhaled and in certain forms of PAH a dramatic improvement in pressures can occur, suggesting specific treatment options such as the use of calcium channel blocker medication. Some patients have an exaggerated pulmonary pressure response to exercise and this too can be measured by utilizing arm exercise during the procedure. Titration of medications for pulmonary hypertension while the catheter is in place can help monitor the response to treatment and assist in optimizing therapy. This can assist in providing individualized therapy for patients with this complex disease.

What is the treatment for pulmonary hypertension?,"'The treatment for pulmonary hypertension depends on the underlying cause.'   If left-sided heart failure is the primary problem, then adequate treatment of the left heart failure by a cardiologist is the mainstay of treatment. In cases where hypoxia (low oxygen levels) due to any chronic lung disease, such as COPD, is the cause, then providing oxygen and appropriately treating the underlying lung disease by a lung doctor (pulmonologist) is the first step in treatment. In some patients, the elevated pressure may be related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and can be reduced with the use of a CPAP (a device that delivers positive airway pressure during sleep). In conditions, such as scleroderma, which often can cause pulmonary hypertension, a rheumatologist is involved in the treatment program. Anticoagulation (thinning the blood) may be a treatment option if the main underlying cause is thought to be recurrent blood clot (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension). As indicated in a previous section, referral to a specialty center may be warranted for a possible surgical removal of blood clot (thromboendarterectomy). For patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (those with no underlying cause), more advanced therapy may be attempted. These drugs have complex mechanisms, but in general they work by dilating (opening up) the pulmonary arteries and, therefore, by reducing the pressure in these blood vessels, and some help prevent the excessive overgrowth of tissue in the blood vessels (that decrease remodeling of the vessels, as described previously). Besides constriction, PAH can result in an actual structural change of the pulmonary arteries; whether it is due to chronically elevated pressures, the disease itself, or a combination of the two is not completely clear. These drugs also can delay and, in some cases, reduce the degree of remodeling of the pulmonary arteries."
What are pulmonary hypertension medications?,"'There are three major classes of drugs used to treat idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with collagen vascular diseases: 1) prostaglandins; 2) phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor; and 3) endothelium-receptor antagonists.''Currently, research is investigating the best ways to combine these medications for the optimal clinical outcomes. It should be noted that these medications are extremely expensive. The companies that manufacture these medications often have programs to assist in funding. These more advanced therapies have also been used for other forms of pulmonary hypertension; however, no clinical studies have yet confirmed benefits in these situations.' Prostaglandins such as epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso), iloprost (Ventavis). These drugs are very short-acting and often must be given intravenously or inhaled on a very frequent or continuous basis. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) are somewhat less effective than the prostaglandins but are easily administered one to three times per day by mouth. (The dosing is much different when these drugs are used for erectile dysfunction.) Endothelium antagonists are the newest medications used for this condition. These include bosentan (Tracleer) and ambrisentan (Letairis). These medications are also given by mouth one to two times per day. A unique drug, riociguat (Adempas), is indicated for pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease (CTEPH). The mechanism of action is different then the drugs above. It works by increasing the effect of nitric oxide causing increased pulmonary vasodilation. In rare cases, calcium channel blockers (CCBS) may be of benefit."
Is there a cure for pulmonary hypertension?,"'Despite advances in various treatments, there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension.' "
What is the life expectancy for people with pulmonary hypertension?,"'Generally, the prognosis of pulmonary hypertension\xa0varies depending on the underlying condition that is causing it. For idiopathic or familial pulmonary hypertension, the overall prognosis depends on the severity and whether treatment was instituted. The statistics show a survival of about 3 years in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension without any therapy. Some of the other factors may indicate even poorer prognosis, which includes severe symptoms, age of onset greater than 45 years, evidence of right-sided heart failure, and failure to respond to treatment. For patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension who get started on treatment and respond to it, the prognosis is better. Studies are underway to determine optimal treatment regimens.' "
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What are Phakic Lenses?,"'Phakic intraocular lenses'', or phakic lenses, are lenses made of ''plastic'"" or silicone that are implanted into the eye permanently to reduce a person's need for glasses or contact lenses. Phakic refers to the fact that the ""'lens'"" is implanted into the eye without removing the eye's natural lens. During phakic lens implantation surgery, a small incision is made in the front of the eye. The phakic lens is inserted through the incision and placed just in front of or just behind the ""'iris''.'""Phakic lenses are used to correct refractive errors, errors in the eye's focusing power. Currently all phakic lenses approved by the FDA are for the correction of nearsightedness (""'myopia'').''The ''cornea'' and natural lens of the eye focus light to create an image on the retina, much like the way the lens of a camera focuses light to create an image on film. The bending and focusing of light is also known as refraction. Imperfections in the focusing power of the eye, called refractive errors, cause images on the retina to be out of focus or blurred.''People that are nearsighted have more difficulty seeing distant objects than near objects. For these people, the images of distant objects come to focus in front of the retina instead of on the retina.''Ideally, phakic lenses cause light entering the eye to be focused on the retina providing clear distance vision without the aid of glasses or contact lenses.''Surgery is not required to correct nearsightedness. You can wear glasses or contact lenses instead to correct your vision. Depending on how nearsighted you are, and other conditions of your eye, other refractive surgery (surgery to correct refractive errors) options may be available to you, including PRK (''Photorefractive Keratectomy'') and ''LASIK'' (Laser Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis).''Phakic lenses are intended to be permanent. While the lenses can be surgically removed, return to your previous level of vision or condition of your eye cannot be guaranteed.'""Phakic intraocular lenses are implanted in the eye without removing the natural lens. This is in contrast to intraocular lenses that are implanted into eyes after the eye's cloudy natural lens (""'cataract'') has been removed during ''cataract surgery''.' "
Are Phakic Lenses for You?,"'The safety and effectiveness of phakic lenses have NOT been studied in patients with certain conditions. If any of the following apply to you, make sure you discuss them with your doctor:' You are not an adult. There are no phakic lenses approved by the FDA for persons under the age of 21. You are not a risk taker. Certain complications are unavoidable in a percentage of patients, and there are no long-term data available for phakic lenses. You required a change in your contact lens or glasses prescription in the last 6 to 12 months in order to obtain the best possible vision for you. This is called refractive instability. Patients who are: in their early 20s or younger, 
 whose hormones are fluctuating due to disease such as diabetes, 
 who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or 
 who are taking medications that may cause fluctuations in vision, 
 You may jeopardize your career. Some jobs prohibit certain refractive procedures. Be sure to check with your employer/professional society/military service before undergoing any procedure. Cost is an issue. Most medical insurance will not pay for refractive surgery. You have a disease or are on medications that may affect wound healing. Certain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), immunodeficiency states (e.g., HIV) and diabetes, and some medications (e.g., retinoic acid and steroids) may prevent proper healing after intraocular surgery. You have a low endothelial cell count or abnormal endothelial cells. If the cells that pump the fluid out of your cornea, the endothelial cells, are low in number relative to your age, or if your endothelial cells are abnormal, you have a higher risk of developing a cloudy cornea and requiring a corneal transplant. You actively participate in sports with a high risk of eye trauma. Your eye may be more susceptible to damage should you receive a blow to the face or eye, such as a blow to the head during boxing or hit in the eye by a ball during baseball. Your eye may be more susceptible to rupture or retinal detachment, and the phakic lens may dislocate. You only have one eye with potentially good vision. If you only have one eye with good vision with glasses or contact lenses, due to disease, irreparable damage, or amblyopia (eye with poor vision since childhood that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses), you and your doctor should consider the risk of possible damage and/or loss of vision to your better eye as a result phakic lens implantation. You have large pupils. If your pupil dilates in low lighting conditions to a size that is larger than the size of the lens, you have a higher risk of experiencing visual disturbances after surgery that may affect your ability to function comfortably or normally under such conditions (e.g., while driving at night). You have a shallow anterior chamber. If the space between the cornea and the iris, the anterior chamber, is narrow, you have a higher risk of developing complications, such as greater endothelial cell loss, due to implantation of the phakic lens. You have an abnormal iris. If your pupil is irregularly shaped you have a higher risk of developing visual disturbances. You have had uveitis. If you have had inflammation in your eye, you may have a recurrence or worsening of your disease and/or may develop additional complications, such as glaucoma, as a result of surgery. You have had problems with the posterior part of your eye. If you have had any problems in the back part of your eye or are at risk for such problems, for example, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (growth of abnormal vessels in the back of the eye due to diabetes) or retinal detachment, you may not be a good candidate for phakic lens implantation. The phakic lens may not allow your eye doctor to get a clear view of the back part of your eye, preventing or delaying detection of a new or worsening problem, and/or the phakic lens may prevent or make treatment of a problem in the back of your eye more difficult. You have glaucoma (damage to the nerve of the eye resulting in loss of peripheral and then central vision due to too high pressure inside the eye), ocular hypertension (high eye pressure), or glaucoma suspect (some indications, but not clear, that patient has glaucoma). You may have a higher risk of developing or worsening of glaucoma as a result of phakic lens implantation.  You have pseudoexfoliation syndrome (abnormal deposits of material in the eye visible on the structures in the front part of the eye, such as on the front of the natural lens and the back of the cornea). This syndrome is associated with glaucoma and weakness of the structures holding the natural lens in place (the zonules). You may have a higher risk of surgical complications and/or complications after surgery if you have this syndrome.  You have had an eye injury or previous eye surgery.  Your need for visual correction is outside the range for which the phakic lens has been approved. Ask your eye doctor if the phakic lens that he or she recommends for you has been approved to treat your refractive error and/or check  FDA-Approved Phakic Lenses for the approved refractive range.  You are over the age of 45 years old. Some phakic lenses have not been studied in patients over the age of 45."
What are the Risks?,"""Implanting a phakic lens involves a surgical procedure. As in any other medical procedure, there are risks involved. That's why it is important for you to understand the limitations and potential risks of phakic ""'intraocular lens'' implant surgery.''Before undergoing surgery for implantation of a phakic intraocular lens, you should carefully weigh the risks and benefits and try to avoid being influenced by other people encouraging you to do it.'  You may lose vision. Some patients lose vision as a result of phakic lens implant surgery that cannot be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or another surgery. The amount of vision loss may be severe.  You may develop debilitating visual symptoms. Some patients develop glare, halos, double vision, and/or decreased vision in situations of low level lighting that can cause difficulty with performing tasks, such as driving, particularly at night or under foggy conditions. You may need additional eye surgery to reposition, replace or remove the phakic lens implant. These surgeries may be necessary for your safety or to improve your visual function. If the lens power is not right, then a phakic lens exchange may be needed. You may also have to have the lens repositioned, removed, or replaced, if the lens does not stay in the right place, is not the right size, and/or causes debilitating visual symptoms. Every additional surgical procedure has its own risks.  You may be under treated or over treated. A significant proportion of treated patients do not achieve 20/20 vision after surgery. The power of the implanted phakic lens may be too strong or too weak. This is because of the difficulties with determining exactly what power lens you need. This means that you will probably still need glasses or contact lenses to perform at least some tasks. For example, you may need glasses for reading, even if you did not need them before surgery. This also means that you may need a second surgery to replace the lens with another, if the power of the originally implanted lens was too far from what you needed.  You may develop increased intraocular pressure. You may experience increased pressure inside the eye after surgery, which may require surgery or medication to control. You may need long-term treatment with glaucoma medications. If the pressure is too high for too long, you may lose vision.  Your cornea may become cloudy. The endothelial cells of your cornea are a thin layer of cells responsible for pumping fluid out of the cornea to keep it clear. If the endothelial cells become too few in number, the endothelial cell pump will fail and the cornea will become cloudy, resulting in loss of vision. You start with a certain number of cells at birth, and this number continuously decreases as you age, since these cells are not replenished. Normally, you die from old age before the number of endothelial cells becomes so low that your cornea becomes cloudy. Some lens designs have shown that their implantation causes endothelial cells to be lost at a faster rate than normal. If the number of endothelial cells drops too low and your cornea becomes cloudy, you will lose vision and you may require a corneal transplant in order to see more clearly.  You may develop a cataract. You may get a cataract, clouding of the natural lens. The amount of time for a cataract to develop can vary greatly. If the cataract develops and progresses enough to significantly decrease your vision, you may require cataract surgery during which both the natural and the phakic lenses will have to be removed.  You may develop a retinal detachment.The retina is the tissue that lines the inside of the back of your eyeball. It contains the light-sensing cells that collect and send images to your brain, much like the film in a camera. The risk of the retina becoming detached from the back of the eye increases after intraocular surgery. It is not known at this time by how much your risk of retinal detachment will increase as a result of phakic intraocular lens implantation surgery.  You may experience infection, bleeding, or severe inflammation (pain, redness, and decreased vision). These are rare complications that can sometimes lead to permanent loss of vision or loss of the eye.  Long-term data is not available. Phakic lenses are a new technology and have only recently been approved by the FDA. Therefore, there may be other risks to having phakic lenses implanted that we don't yet know about."
"What you should know and do before, during, and after surgery?","'This section gives you a general idea of what you might expect if you decide to have phakic intraocular lens implantation surgery. What to expect before, during and after surgery will vary according to:''The information provided here may not apply to your particular situation and should not replace an in-depth discussion with your doctor.''Before deciding to have phakic intraocular lens implantation surgery, you will need an initial examination to make sure your eye is healthy and suitable for surgery. Your doctor will take a complete history about your medical and eye health and perform a thorough examination of both eyes, which will include measurements of your pupils, anterior chamber depth (the distance between your cornea and iris), and endothelial cell counts (the number of cells on the back of your cornea).''If you wear contact lenses'', your doctor may ask you to stop wearing them before your initial examination (from the day of to a few weeks before), so that your refraction (measure of how much your eye bends light) and central keratometry readings (measure of how much the cornea curves) are more accurate.''At this time, ''you should tell your doctor'' if you:''To help you decide whether phakic lenses are right for you, talk to your doctor about your expectations and whether there are elements of your medical history, eye history, or eye examination that might increase your risk or prevent you from having the outcome you expect. Before you sign an informed consent document (a form giving permission to your doctor to operate on your eye), you should discuss with your doctor:''You should have the opportunity to ask your doctor questions during this discussion. Ask your doctor for the Patient Labeling of the lens that he or she recommends for you. Give yourself plenty of time to think about the risk/benefit discussion, to review any informational literature provided by your doctor, and to have any additional questions answered by your doctor before deciding to go through with surgery and before signing the informed consent document. You should not feel pressured by anyone to make a decision about having surgery. Carefully consider the pros and cons.''About one to two weeks before surgery, your eye doctor may schedule you for a ''laser iridotomy'' to prepare your eye for implantation of the phakic lens. Before the procedure, your eye doctor may put drops in your eye to make the pupil small and to numb the eye. While you are seated, you doctor will rest a large lens on your eye. He or she will then make a small hole (or holes) in the extreme outer edge of the iris (the colored part of your eye) with a laser. This hole (holes) are to prevent fluid buildup and pressure in the back chamber of your eye after phakic lens implantation surgery. This procedure is usually performed in an office or clinic setting, not in an operating room, and usually only takes a few minutes.''After the iridotomy procedure, the doctor may have you wait around awhile before checking your eye pressure and letting you go home. The procedure should not prevent you from driving home, but you should check with your eye doctor when you schedule your appointment. You will be given a prescription for steroid drops to put in your eye at home for several days to reduce inflammation from the iridotomy procedure. It is important that you follow all instructions your doctor gives you after the iridotomy procedure.''Your doctor may ask you to ''stop wearing contact lenses'' before your surgery (anywhere from the day of the surgery to a few weeks before).''Before your surgery, your eye doctor may ask you to ''temporarily stop taking certain medications that increase the risk of bleeding'' during surgery. How long before surgery you may need to stop these medications depends upon which medications you are using and the conditions they are treating. You and your eye doctor may need to discuss stopping certain medications with the doctor who prescribed them, since you may need some of these medications to prevent life-threatening events. For example, you may need medications that stop blood clotting to keep from having a ''stroke''.''Your doctor may give you prescriptions for antibiotic ''drops'' to prevent infection and/or anti-inflammatory drops to prevent inflammation to put in your eye for a few days ''before surgery''.''Arrange for transportation'"" to and from surgery and to your follow-up doctor's appointment the day after surgery, since you will be unable to drive. Your doctor will let you know when it is safe for you to drive again.""'Your eye doctor will probably tell you ''not to eat or drink anything'' after midnight the night ''before your surgery''.''Just before surgery, drops will be put in your eye. You will have to lie down for the surgery and remain still. If you cannot lie down flat on your back, you may not be a good candidate for this surgery. Usually, patients are not put to ''sleep'' for this type of surgery, but you may be given a sedative or other medication to make you relax and an i.v. may be started. Your doctor may inject medication around the eye to numb the eye. The doctor also may give you an injection around the eye to also prevent you from being able to move your eye or see out of your eye. You will have to ask your doctor to find out exactly which of these types of anesthesia will be used in your case. Your eye and the surrounding area will be cleaned and an instrument called a lid speculum will be used to hold your eyelids open.''The doctor will make an incision in your cornea, sclera (the white part of your eye), or limbus (where the cornea meets the sclera). He or she will place a lubricant into your eye to help protect the back of the cornea (the endothelial cells) during the insertion of the phakic lens. The doctor will insert the phakic lens through the incision in the eye into the anterior chamber, behind the cornea and in front of the iris. Depending upon the type of phakic lens, the doctor will either attach the lens to the front of the iris in the anterior chamber of the eye or move it through the pupil into position behind the iris and in front of the lens in the posterior chamber of the eye. The doctor will remove the lubricant and may close the incision with tiny ''stitches'', depending upon the type of incision. Your doctor will place some eye drops or ointment in your eye and cover your eye with a patch and/or a shield. The surgery will probably take around 30 minutes.''After the surgery is over, you may be brought to a recovery room for a couple of hours before you will be allowed to go home. You will be given prescriptions for antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops to use at home as directed. You will be given an Implant Identification Card, which you should keep as a permanent record of the lens that was implanted in your eye. Make sure you show this card to anyone who takes care of your eyes in the future. You will be asked to go home and take it easy for the rest of the day.''After the surgical procedure, you may be sensitive to light and have a feeling that something is in your eye. You may experience minor discomfort after the procedure. Your doctor may prescribe ''pain'' medication to make you more comfortable during the first few days after the surgery. ''You should contact your eye doctor immediately if you have severe pain.''You should see your eye doctor the day after surgery. Your doctor will remove the patch and/or shield and will check your vision and the condition of your eye. Your doctor will instruct you on how to use the eye ''drops'' that you were prescribed for ''after the surgery''. You will need to take these drops for up to a few weeks after surgery to decrease inflammation and help prevent infection. Your doctor may instruct you to continue wearing the shield all day and all night or just at night. You should wear the shield until your doctor tells you that you no longer have to do so. The shield is meant to prevent you from rubbing your eye or putting pressure on your eye while you ''sleep'' and to protect your eye from accidentally being hit or poked while it is healing.''Your vision will probably be somewhat hazy or blurry for the first several days after surgery. Your vision should start to improve after the first several days, but may continue to fluctuate for the next several weeks. It usually takes about 2 to 4 weeks for the vision to stabilize. Do NOT rub your eyes, especially for the first 3 to 5 days. You may also experience ''sensitivity to light'', glare, starbursts or halos around lights, or the whites of your eye may look red or bloodshot. These symptoms should decrease as your eye recovers over the next several weeks.''You should contact your doctor immediately'' if you develop severe pain or if your vision or other symptoms get worse instead of better. Follow all postoperative instructions given to you by your surgeon and surgical center.''Your doctor will instruct you to return for additional follow-up visits to monitor your progress. Initially, these visits will be closer together (a few days to a few weeks apart) and then they will be spread out (several weeks to several months apart). It is important to go to all these appointments, even if you think you are doing well, so that the doctor can check for complications that you may not be aware of.''Because you will have a permanent implant in your eye with long-term risks, and especially since all these risks are not known at this time, ''you will need to be followed by an eye doctor on a regular basis for the rest of your life. Endothelial cell counts will have to be performed on a regular basis. You and/or your doctor should maintain records of these measurements, so as to be able to estimate the rate of cell loss.'' It is especially important for you to have your endothelial cells counted before you and your eye doctor consider any other intraocular procedures, such as cataract surgery, that will decrease the endothelial cell count even further.''Annual eye exams are usually recommended. However, if you have any problems with your vision or your eyes, such as flashing lights, floating spots, or blank spots in your vision (symptoms of a retinal detachment), you should see an eye doctor right away and inform him or her that you have a phakic lens implant. When participating in sports or other activities during which you might injure your eye, like home improvement work, always wear protective eye wear, such as safety goggles.'

What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
What is pharyngitis?,"'Pharyngitis'' is medical term for a ''sore throat''. Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx (throat) that results in throat discomfort, ''pain'' and/or throat scratchiness; in some individuals it may cause painful swallowing. ''Sore throat'' is usually caused by a viral infection and less commonly, a bacterial infection usually by group A ''streptococci'' (''strep throat''). Other causes of ''sore throat'' include inflammation due to ''allergy'', toxins, or ''cancer''. Some doctors distinguish pharyngitis from ''laryngitis'' and/or ''tonsillitis'', but others do not. ''Laryngitis'' is confined to the larynx (voice box) while tonsillitis is inflammation confined to the ''tonsils''. Since it is not unusual for a pharyngitis to spread to adjacent structures like the ''tonsils'' or larynx, it is not unreasonable to lump these inflammatory diseases together; however, the symptoms are slightly different for each disease.''There are three types of pharyngitis:'   Non-exudative (does not produce fluids like pus; this is the most common form of pharyngitis and usually caused by viruses) Exudative (produces a body fluid like pus; this usually suggest a bacterial cause) Ulcerative (production of small ulcers and/or a grayish membrane on parts of the pharynx). Ulcerative pharyngitis (mainly caused by bacteria) is infrequently seen but is considered to be a medical emergency."
Is a sore throat contagious?,"'Yes, pharyngitis (viral and bacterial) is ''contagious'' and can be transmitted from one person to another. Usually, mucus, nasal discharge and saliva can contain the viruses and/or bacteria that can cause sore throat. Consequently, even kissing can cause transfer of these organisms. Unfortunately, some of these viruses and bacteria that cause sore throat can survive for a period of time on objects like towels, brushes or even clothing, so that contact with these contaminated items can spread the disease.''Sore throat caused by ''allergy'', toxins, ''trauma'' or ''cancers'' are not contagious. The focus of this article will be on sore throat caused by viruses and bacteria since these are the most common causes of sore throat.' "
How will I know if someone has a sore throat?,"'Pharyngitis can cause the pharynx (the throat) tissue to become swollen and reddish. Some people can develop a mild ''fever'' and have some difficulties speaking or swallowing food. ''swollen Lymph nodes'' and tonsils may enlarge and become tender. Those affected may feel excessively tired.''Laboratory studies can detect group A ''streptococci'' (rapid antigen detection). Other diagnostic tests can include throat cultures or the ''mono'' spot test. A health care professional may help you determine the cause of your sore throat. In addition, some doctors use the specific set of criteria (Centor criteria) to determine the likelihood of a person getting ''strep throat'' (''Streptococcal'' pharyngitis).' "
How is sore throat spread?,"""Sore throat is transmitted from one person to another by bacteria or viruses in the infected person's saliva, mucus and/or nasal discharge. People that are not infected just need to come in contact with these substances directly or indirectly by touching contaminated objects such as hairbrushes, towels, or toothbrushes."" "
How will I know if I'm cured of a sore throat?,"'Sore throat caused by viruses is usually contagious as long as symptoms are present. Once the symptoms disappear, the person is usually no longer contagious and is ""cured"" of viral pharyngitis. However, the person may still be susceptible to other types of viruses that can cause pharyngitis. Bacterial pharyngitis usually is also contagious as long as symptoms are present but, in contrast to viral pharyngitis, antibiotics may reduce the time span of infection, and the individual becomes no longer contagious about 24 hours after taking an effective antibiotic.'  "
When should I contact a health care professional about a sore throat?,"'If a person has a sore throat should contact a health care professional if they''Go to an emergency department immediately if a person develops' have a sore throat for more than a week, if they develop a reddish rash, if the lymph nodes are swollen and tender, and/or if the person has a high fever. drooling, shortness of breath, or difficulty in eating or swallowing foods or liquids."
What causes a sore throat?,"'There are several different causes of sore throats.''Viral infections:'' Viruses are the most common cause of sore throats. Several different viruses can cause common colds and an upper respiratory infections and include:''Bacterial infections'':'' Less common causes of bacterial infections that cause sore throats include:''Rarely, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs''), for example, ''gonorrhea'' and ''chlamydia'', can cause a sore throat.''Toxins/Irritants:'' Many substances can cause sore throats, for example:' Viruses that cause the flu (influenza) Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus) Mumps (mumps virus) Croup (parainfluenza virus) Coxsackie A virus (herpangina) Strep throat Peritonsillar abscess Retropharyngeal abscess Diphtheria Epiglottitis Tonsillitis Cigarette smoke Air pollution Noxious airborne chemicals Medical conditions: Health problems, can cause sore throats, for example:Postnasal dripAllergiesCoughGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)Tumors Postnasal drip Allergies Cough Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Tumors Intentional or unintentional ingestion: Certain substances, for example, bleach, can cause a sore throat. Trauma/Injury: Any direct injury to the throat or neck area can cause a sore throat. Foreign body : Sore throats can be caused foreign bodies stuck in the throat, for example, a bone or piece of food. Excessive yelling or screaming: The throat and larynx can cause sore throats due to screaming or excessive yelling."
What are the differences between sore throat vs. strep throat?,"'Sore throat is a generic term used to describe the symptom of pain or discomfort in the throat. Usually, bacteria, viruses, trauma, and environmental toxins cause throat pain and its associated symptoms and signs. However, not all cases of sore throat are necessarily ''strep throat''.''Strep throat'' is a bacterial infection of the throat and ''tonsils'' (tonsilitis). ''Strep'' throat is specifically caused by group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. Diagnosis of the cause of ''strep'' throat, and the characteristic signs and symptoms, laboratory tests help diagnose the cause of strep throat. Two common tests are used to diagnose the cause of strep throat, the ''rapid strep test'' (RADT) and traditional throat culture.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of a sore throat?,"'The signs and symptoms of a sore throat vary depending on the underlying cause. However, the common symptom of a sore throat is the feeling of throat pain and discomfort, which often is worsened by swallowing or thile talking. Some people may complain of a scratchy or dry sensation in their throat as well.''Most sore throats are caused by viral infections. In addition to throat pain, common signs and symptoms of a sore throat include:''Distinguishing between a sore throat caused by a virus and strep throat can be challenging; however, certain signs and symptoms often can help differentiate between the two. Usually, people with strep throat have signs and symptoms that include red ''swollen tonsils'' with white patches (exudate).''Sore throats cause fever and swollen tender lymph nodes in the neck, ''without the symptoms'' that usually accompany a ''cold'' caused by a virus, for example:''An evaluation with a doctor may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of a sore throat while a throat culture (swab taken from the back of the throat) can definitively diagnose the cause of strep throat.'

"If I am pregnant and have a sore throat, what medications are safe to take?","'If you are pregnant and your sore throat symptoms are severe, talk to your doctor. Home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' lozenges or saltwater gargles are generally safe. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') can be used for pain or fever. If symptoms last for more than three days, or are associated with a fever see your doctor to be tested for strep throat.' "
Is a sore throat contagious?,"'A sore throat may be ''contagious'', depending on the underlying cause. Most sore throats are caused by infections, and under these circumstances a sore throat can be contagious, whether it is caused by a viral infection (the most common cause) or strep throat. To prevent spreading contagious infections that cause sore throats, preventative measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of the infection.''Most types of these infections are transmitted person-to-person via saliva or nasal secretions commonly spread in airborne respiratory droplets, or through direct contact with infected objects (for example, cups or utensils) and infected surfaces. To stop the spread of infections to others:' Wash your hands fequently Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze Do not sharing utensils and cups"
Is there a test to diagnose the cause of sore throats?,"'To diagnose the cause of a sore throat, the doctor will ask for a detailed history of the illness and perform a physical examination. Because most cases of sore throats are associated with infections, your doctor may order tests to differentiate between a bacterial or viral infection. If your doctor suspects you have strep throat, usually, he or she will take a rapid strep test (swabbing the throat). It takes only minutes for the results, and usually can be obtained during an office visit. A throat culture may be sent to the lab for definitive evaluation of strep throat if the initial rapid strep test is negative. Usually, the results of the culture are available within 24 to 48 hours.''Usually, no further tests are needed, depending on the details of the medical history and the findings on a physical exam. Your doctor may need to order addditional tests to help determine the cause of the sore throat, for example:' Blood tests Radiologic imaging (CT scan or x-ray) of the throat and neck area to evaluate for other various causes of a sore throat (abscess, trauma/injury, tumor, etc). In certain cases, a specialist may be recommended depending on the symptoms and presumptive diagnosis (an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist, for example).."
What natural home remedies relieve sore throat pain and other symptoms?,"'Various home remedies help soothe throat pain and other symptoms of a sore throat.''If a sore throat is caused by infection, it is important to drink plenty of fluids and to rest in order to prevent ''dehydration'' and to allow the body to properly recover.'

What can I do if I keep getting a sore or strep throat?,"'There are a number of situations in which a child or adult can have recurrent positive strep tests.' The first, and most common, is that the strep bacteria were never eradicated in the first place. The person did not get all of the doses of the medication prescribed. Unless the affected person takes a full 5 to 10 day course of antibiotics, the strep throat will not clear. Even missing a dose or two can be a problem. The patient should take all medication exactly as prescribed, and finish all the medication, even if the sore throat has resolved. Individuals may be asymptomatic carriers of strep (a person who has strep in their throats all the time as part of their normal bacteria, but without symptoms of a sore throat). It may be necessary to test close contacts of a person with recurrent episodes of strep to see if they are carriers. All strep throat bacteria will be killed by penicillin. If penicillin does not cure strep throat, the affected person should see their doctor. In rare cases, other bacteria in the throat can secrete an enzyme (penicillinase) that breaks down penicillin. This can be overcome by using a drug that is resistant to this enzyme."
Can antibiotics cure a sore throat?,"""Most cases of sore throat are caused by a viral infection, so antibiotics in these situations are not needed. Antibiotics do not have any effect on a viral infection, as it will need to run its course and your body's natural defenses will typically clear this type of infection.""'However, if your sore throat is being caused by a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, then a course of antibiotics will be required to resolve the infection. Complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed, even if you feel better after a few days.'  "
How can I prevent from getting a sore throat?,"'Often, certain causes of sore throats can be prevented since the most common cause are infections. Whether a sore throat is caused by a viral infection or strep throat, you can help prevent getting or transmitting the infection to others.''Certain measures to help prevent less common causes of sore throats include:' Avoid close contact with people who are already ill with a viral upper respiratory tract infection or with strep throat (and other bacterial infections). Practice good personal hygiene habits, such as frequent and thorough hand washing. Avoid sharing personal objects (such as dishes, cups or utensils). Cover the mouth when coughing or sneezing. Wash the hands often. Avoiding touching potentially infected surfaces (computers, doorknobs, or phones) and direct contact with handkerchiefs, napkins, tissues, or towels used by the person with the infection. Taking antibiotics and finishting the full course to treat and decrease transmission of the bacteria causing the infection. Taking OTC medications to help prevent sore throats if the cause is GERD, allergies, postnasal drip, or cough. Avoid cigarette smoke, pollutants and noxious airborne chemicals. Taking safety measures and using protective sports equipment to help avoid traumatic injury to the neck and throat. Chewing your food carefully in order to prevent injury to the throat from a foreign body (from a fish bone, for example) Avoiding excessive or prolonged yelling."
When should I see a doctor for a sore throat?,"'Sore throat is a common symptom, and the decision to seek medical care can sometimes be difficult. Though many individuals with a sore throat will have a viral illness that will typically run its course and resolve without problems, certain causes of sore throats may require treatment beyond waiting out the illness and treating it with over-the-counter medications. See a doctor if your sore throat continues for an extended period.''If you have these signs or symptoms, make an appointment with doctor or to the nearest emergency department:' Severe sore throat Drooling Difficulty or inability to swallow saliva, food, or liquids Difficulty or inability to open your mouth Difficulty breathing Severe neck pain or neck stiffness Redness or swelling of the neck Bleeding from the throat, or blood in your saliva/phlegm Fever greatern than> 101 F (38.3 C)"
What is phenylketonuria?,"'Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the ''diet''. It is found in all proteins and in some ''artificial sweeteners''. If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.'  "
How common is phenylketonuria?,"'The occurrence of PKU varies among ethnic groups and geographic regions worldwide. In the United States, PKU occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 (newborns. Most cases of PKU are detected shortly after birth by newborn screening, and treatment is started promptly. As a result, the severe signs and symptoms of classic PKU are rarely seen.' "
What genes are related to phenylketonuria?,"'Mutations in the ''PAH'' gene cause phenylketonuria.''The ''PAH'' gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other important compounds in the body. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.''Classic PKU, the most severe form of the disorder, occurs when phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is severely reduced or absent. People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the ''PAH'' gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.''Changes in other genes may influence the severity of PKU, but little is known about these additional genetic factors.' "
How do people inherit phenylketonuria?,"'This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "

What is a pheochromocytoma?,"'Pheochromocytomas are a type of tumor of the adrenal glands that can release high levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. As the name implies, the adrenalglands are located near the ""renal"" (kidney) area.\xa0 One adrenal gland sits on top of each of the two kidneys.''Despite their small size, the adrenal glands have many functions. They are complex endocrine (hormone secreting) glands. Cells in different regions of the adrenal glands have different functions in the endocrine system.The outer portion of the adrenal gland is called the adrenal cortex. In part of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata and zona reticularis) the cells secrete cortisol, a hormone similar to cortisone, which is essential for handling stresses In another area (zona glomerulosa) cells secrete a hormone called aldosterone which helps in water and salt regulation and ''blood pressure'' control.''The inner area of the adrenal gland is referred to as the adrenal medulla. This is where the cells secrete substances called catecholamines -- epinephrine, norepinephrine and ''dopamine''. These are ""flight or fight"" hormones. They are responsible in part for that feeling of an ""adrenaline"" rush people feel when they are afraid. It is these cells that are overproduced by a pheochromocytoma. Basically, a pheochromocytoma is a tumor of these catecholamine-secreting cells, and that causes the clinical signs and symptoms we will discuss below. The catecholamine-secreting cells are sometimes referred to as chromaffin cells, and they are found in other areas of the body as well as in the adrenal medulla.''Sometimes, pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells that are located outside of the adrenal gland. In this case, they are termed extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas and are usually located in the abdomen.''Pheochromocytomas may occur in persons of any age. The peak incidence is between the third and the fifth decades of life. Pheochromocytomas are, fortunately, quite rare, and most of them are benign.'  "
What are the symptoms of a pheochromocytoma?,"'Someone with a pheochromocytoma usually has three classic symptoms -- ''headache'', ''sweating'', and ''heart'' ''palpitations'' (a ''fast heart beat'') in association with markedly elevated blood pressure (''hypertension''). Other conditions that may accompany these classic symptoms are as follows: ''anxiety'', ''nausea'', ''tremors'', ''weakness'', ''abdominal pain'', and ''weight loss''.''Some people, however, never develop symptoms of a pheochromocytoma. Up to 10% of cases are discovered incidentally, meaning that they are not suspected and only found when the patient is undergoing diagnostic studies for other conditions. In some cases, the ''high blood pressure'' comes and goes and may be difficult to document. In other cases, the blood pressure is consistently elevated and easily recorded.''Pheochromocytomas are present in only about 0.2% of all people with ''high blood pressure''. There are certain conditions, however, in which the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma may rank high on the list of possibilities; they are discussed below.' "
What conditions are associated with pheochromocytomas?,"'Pheochromocytomas can be a component of certain familial or genetic syndromes. The most common familial condition is called multiple endocrine neoplasia, or MEN for short. Two types of MEN -- MEN 2A and 2B -- are associated with pheochromocytomas. Both are genetic syndromes that run in families and are transmitted from parent to child in an autosomal dominant manner.''Pheochromocytomas are not the only tumors that occur in MEN 2A and 2B. MEN 2A carries an increased risk of tumors of the parathyroids, glands near the thyroid that help to regulate calcium levels in the body. And both MEN 2A and 2B elevate the risk of medullary ''carcinoma of the thyroid'' - an unusual type of\xa0 ''thyroid cancer''. In families where MEN is suspected, genetic testing can be done to help identify family members at risk.''Pheochromocytomas are a feature of other genetic disorders, including von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and ''neurofibromatosis type 1''. Both of these disorders are associated with the development of numerous benign and malignant tumors.''There are also many individuals who have pheochromocytomas with no known family history of them. These cases are termed sporadic. In general, if these patients have bilateral disease (pheochromocytomas in both adrenal glands) or are diagnosed before the age of 21, genetic screening is recommended.' "
What else can cause the symptoms of a pheochromocytoma?,"'Basically, anything that can cause over activity of the sympathetic nervous system can be on the list of diagnoses to rule out when suspecting a pheochromocytoma. The sympathetic system is the main control panel governing the release of the ""flight or fight"" response in response to ''stress'' or fear, as mentioned above. Things that can stimulate this include ''drugs'' (even excessive use of decongestants should be considered); withdrawal from drugs (such as suddenly stopping certain blood pressure medications); ''panic attacks'', and spinal cord injuries are among the many conditions that can also lead to some of the symptoms seen in pheochromocytomas.' "
How is pheochromocytoma diagnosed?,"'Pheochromocytoma is a possibility in anyone with the classic triad of symptoms -- ''headache'', sweating, and heart ''palpitations'' -- especially when there is ''high blood pressure'' (though high blood pressure is not always present). A physician becomes more suspicious if the patient is young and has no other risk factors or habits that may cause these findings.''Perhaps the patient knows their family history well and can inform their doctor of other types of endocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma(s) diagnosed in family members. Consequently, a doctor suspecting familial pheochromocytoma can go straight to genetic testing. However, in most cases, if suspicion is high, the physician proceeds with a series of tests to measure the culprit hormones and their breakdown products (metabolites) listed below.''First, hormones such as catecholamines and metanephrines are measured in a 24 hour urine collection, and metanephrines may also be measured in the blood. If these are greater than 2 times the normal level, imaging studies are usually done to look at the adrenal glands.''If imaging with ''MRI'' or ''CT scans'' of the adrenal glands shows a mass in the gland (or outside it), surgery may be done. If it is not clear that the mass is actually functional and related to the findings clinically, or if there is no mass seen on imaging, another test can be performed. This test called a 131-I-MIBG scan is quite specific for pheochromocytomas. In this test a radioactive ''iodine'' molecule is injected into the bloodstream and localized in the area of the tumor, allowing visualization of the pheochromocytoma on imaging studies.' "
How is a pheochromocytoma treated?,"'Surgery is the definitive treatment. Until the tumor is removed, control of blood pressure is a top priority. Controlling blood pressure before and during surgery is the trickiest part of care. There is a chance of developing an acute hypertensive crisis (a potentially dangerous, sudden, and severe rise in blood pressure) after anesthesia is given during the surgery. The blood pressure is therefore managed with special medications both prior to and during surgery and is carefully monitored throughout the procedure. Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended to help design treatment for individual patients.''Because of the types of hormones involved in a pheochromocytoma, first attempts at blood pressure control utilize agents of a specific class of drugs known as alpha blockers. These agents are used prior to use of ''beta blockers'' to balance and best control the blood pressure response to anesthesia.''In the rare instances of pheochromocytomas that are malignant,and not cured by surgery, then ''chemotherapy'' or ''radiation therapy'' may be required after surgery. Trials of very specific or ""targeted"" new drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown some promise in the treatment of pheochromocytoma and are under study in ''clinical trials''. As yet, drug therapy for this disease cannot offer a possible cure, but may benefit the patient by reducing symptomsand sometimes prolonging life.' "
What is the prognosis with a pheochromocytoma?,"'Pheochromocytoma is benign in most cases, and if blood pressure-related surgical complications can be avoided, the likelihood of cure is excellent. Both malignant and benign pheochromocytomas can recur after surgery. The statistics vary from one study to the next, but recurrence rates average around 10%. Therefore, long-term follow-up care after surgery is very important to keep outlooks fair to good with additional appropriate treatments of medicine or surgery.''In the low percent of these already rare tumors in which malignant behavior is evident, survival may still be quite prolonged, as the pace of the disease may still be slow. Participation in clinical trials of new therapies is strongly encouraged in the unfortunate case of metastatic pheochromocytoma. Should a pheochromocytoma be diagnosed during ''pregnancy'', the mortality (death risk) is increased for both the mother and the fetus. Referral as soon as possible to a major center with experience with this circumstance is recommended.' "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
Facts you should know about phimosis and paraphimosis," Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin behind the head (glans) of the penis. Symptoms of may include:Difficulty or pain during urinationPainful erectionParaphimosis (A medical emergency where the foreskin can't return to its normal location once retracted.) Difficulty or pain during urination Painful erection Paraphimosis (A medical emergency where the foreskin can't return to its normal location once retracted.) This penis disorder usually is divided into physiologic and pathologic phimosis.Physiologic phimosis is the normal condition in which children are born with a tight foreskin, and separation occurs during late childhood and early adolescence.Pathologic phimosis happens because of an infection, inflammation, or scarring and usually is found in uncircumcised adult men. Physiologic phimosis is the normal condition in which children are born with a tight foreskin, and separation occurs during late childhood and early adolescence. Pathologic phimosis happens because of an infection, inflammation, or scarring and usually is found in uncircumcised adult men."
What causes phimosis?,"'Physiologic phimosis is present at birth and resolves without intervention. Most children will not have a fully retractable foreskin at birth, but do so as they get older with the majority having a fully retractable foreskin by early adolescence.''Pathologic phimosis is caused by scarring, ''balanitis'', and underlying medical risk factors.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of phimosis?,'The inability of the foreskin to retract can lead to difficulty cleaning of the area which can cause ''balanitis''. Other symptoms include:'   Difficulty urinating Painful urination Painful erection Paraphimosis
How can I tell if I have phimosis?,'Your doctor can diagnose phimosis based on a thorough history and physical examination. Additional tests are usually not necessary.' 
"What medications, creams, or ointments treat and cure phimosis?","'Treatment depends on the age of the male, severity, and resulting symptoms.''The first choice of treatment is usually a steroid ointment that is locally applied. This treatment has shown a success rate of over 70%. The ointment softens the foreskin and is applied for 4 to 6 weeks. Once full retraction is possible the ointment is discontinued.''If the steroid treatment is not successful, a ''circumcision'' might be beneficial. This depends on the underlying symptoms.'  "
What is paraphimosis?,'Paraphimosis occurs when the foreskin is retracted behind the glans penis and cannot be returned to its original position. This turns into a urologic emergency as blood flow is decreased to the glans penis.' 
What are the signs and symptoms of paraphimosis?,"'Once the skin is trapped, ''edema'' occurs and the restriction worsens, often forming a very tight tissue ring. This causes ''pain'' and worsening swelling (''edema'').' "
What causes paraphimosis?,"'Paraphimosis is an uncommon condition usually inadvertently caused by retraction of the foreskin by the individual, or in a hospital or ''nursing'' home setting by a healthcare professional inserting a Foley catheter, or preparing the patient for a procedure.' "
How can I tell if I have paraphimosis?,'Your doctor will diagnose paraphimosis based on a thorough history and the physical examination. Additional tests are usually not necessary.' 
What is the treatment and cure for paraphimosis?,"'Manual reduction is usually the first treatment option. To help with the ''pain'', your doctor other health care professional might apply a local anesthetic cream, give you ''pain'' medication by mouth, or apply a local anesthetic block to your penis. Applying ice to the local area can help with the edema during manual reduction.''Local injection of hyaluronidase is effective in decreasing the swelling and allowing reduction.''If none of these techniques are successful or if the doctor feels a faster reduction is necessary, a small surgical slit can be made in the back side (dorsal region) of the constrictive skin. This should usually be followed by a ''circumcision'' at a later date to avoid a recurrence.' "
Can circumcision prevent these penis problems?,'Circumcision can prevent paraphimosis and phimosis.' 
What is the prognosis if I have had either of these penis conditions?," The prognosis for phimosis is usually very good. A small amount of bleeding can occur as the skin is retracted but long term negative outcomes are very rare. The prognosis for paraphimosis depends on the speed of diagnosis and reduction. There can be serious complications, however, if there is significant reduction of blood flow for an extended time period. Gangrene of the tip of the penis and even loss of the tip is possible."
What should you know about phlebitis and thrombophlebitis?,"'Phlebitis refers to inflammation of a vein and it can be caused by any insult to the blood vessel wall, impaired venous flow, or coagulation abnormality. ''Thrombophlebitis'' refers to the formation of a ''blood clot'' associated with phlebitis. Thrombophlebitis can be superficial (skin level) or deep (in deeper veins). Phlembitis usually affects age 41 past 60; however, toddlers, children, preteens, and people between the ages of 14 and 18 can get phlebitis. ''Pain'', swelling, redness, and tenderness are some common ''symptoms of phlebitis''. Superficial phlebitis generally carries a favorable prognosis and can be treated with inexpensive home remedies. ''Deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT'') can have serious complications and requires immediate treatment with blood thinners. Simple measures can be taken to prevent phlebitis.''Plebitis usually requires a medical diagnosis, which requires lab and imaging test. Phlebitis is a treatable condition and resolves within days to weeks.' "
What is phlebitis and thrombophlebitis?,"'Phlebitis means inflammation of a vein. Thrombophlebitis refers to a ''blood clot'' causing the inflammation. Phlebitis can be superficial, in the skin, or deep, in the tissues beneath the skin.''Superficial phlebitis is phlebitis that is in a superficial vein under the surface of the skin. Deep vein thrombophlebitis refers to a blood clot causing phlebitis in the deeper veins. Deep vein thrombophlebitis is also referred to as deep venous thrombophlebitis, ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT'').''The presence of superficial phlebitis does not necessary suggest an underlying ''DVT''. Upper extremity (upper limbs) and lower extremities (lower limbs) superficial thrombosis or phlebitis are typically benign conditions and have a favorable prognosis. A blood clot (thrombus) in the saphenous vein may be an exception. This is the large, long vein on the inner side of the legs. Thrombophlebitis in the saphenous vein can sometimes be associated with underlying deep vein thrombophlebitis.''On the other hand, ''deep vein thrombosis'' of the upper and lower extremities can be a more serious problem that can lead to a blood clot traveling to the blood vessels of the ''lungs'' and resulting in ''pulmonary embolism''. ''Pulmonary embolism'' can injure lung tissue is serious and occasionally fatal.' "
What are the symptoms of phlebitis?,"'Phlebitis, if mild, may or may not cause symptoms. ''Pain'', tenderness, redness (erythema), and bulging of the vein are common symptoms of phlebitis. The redness and tenderness may follow the course of the vein under the skin.''Low grade ''fever'' may accompany superficial and deep phlebitis. High ''fever'' or ''drainage of pus'' from the site of thrombophlebitis may suggest an infection of the thrombophlebitis (referred to as septic thrombophlebitis).''Palpable cords along the course of the vein may be a sign of a superficial clot or superficial thrombophlebitis.''A deep venous thrombosis may present as redness and swelling of the involved limb with pain and tenderness. In the leg, this can cause difficulty ''walking''.'  "
What causes phlebitis?,"'Phlebitis has many causes. Some of the common causes of phlebitis are:'   local trauma or injury to the vein prolonged inactivity, such as, long driving or plane rides insertion of intravenous catheters (IV) in hospitals, or IV induced phlebitis period after a surgery (post-operative period), especially orthopedic procedures prolonged immobility, as in hospitalized or bed-ridden patients varicose veins underlying cancers or clotting disorders disruption of normal venous system drainage because of removal of lymph nodes, for example, after mastectomy for breast cancer intravenous drug use patients with burns"
What are the risk factors for phlebitis?,"   One of the common risk factors for phlebitis is a trauma. For example, a trauma or an injury to the arm or leg can cause an injury the underlying vein resulting in inflammation or phlebitis. Prolonged immobility is another common risk factor for phlebitis. Blood that is stored in the veins of the lower extremities normally is pumped toward the heart by the contraction of the lower leg muscles. If the muscle contraction is limited due to prolonged (hours) immobility by sitting on a plane or a car, the blood in the veins can become stagnant and clot formation can result in thrombophlebitis. Hormone therapy (HT), birth control pills, and pregnancy all increase the risk for developing thrombophlebitis. Cigarette smoking is another risk factor for thrombophlebitis. Smoking in combination with birth control pills can substantially increase the risk of thromboembolism. Obesity is also a risk factor for thrombophlebitis. Certain cancers are known to increase the risk of clot formation (referred to as a hyper-coagulable state) by causing abnormalities in the normal clotting system (coagulation pathway). Some cancers with hypercoagulable state cause phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. Inherited (primary) or acquired (secondary) hypercoagulable states are associated with an increased risk of phlebitis and thrombosis. Some, but not all, of these states can be identified by appropriate laboratory testing. Recent surgery of any type can be associated with the conditions. The highest risk seems to come with major orthopedic procedures and procedures for cancers."
How is phlebitis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of superficial phlebitis can be made based on the physical examination by a physician. Warmth, tenderness, redness, and swelling along the course of the vein is highly suggestive of superficial phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. An ''ultrasound'' of the area can help in making the diagnosis of phlebitis or excluding it.''Deep vein thrombosis is more difficult to diagnose on the basis of clinical examination. The strongest clinical indicator is unilateral extremity swelling, which may be associated with pain, warmth, redness, discoloration or other findings. The most commonly used imaging test for diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is ultrasound. It is less expensive than alternatives and highly reliable. In many settings, however, it is simply not available 24 hours per day.''Other imaging tests of benefit in specific situations include - but are not limited to - ''CT scan'', ''MRI'' scan and venography (phlebography).''D-Dimer is a useful blood test that can suggest phlebitis. This is a chemical that is released by ''blood clots'' when they start to degrade. A normal D-Dimer makes the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis unlikely. The limitation of this test is its lack of specificity, meaning that an elevated D-dime level can be seen in other conditions including recent surgery, fall, pregnancy, or an underlying ''cancer''.''Conditions that mimic phlebitis include ''cellulitis'' (superficial ''skin infection''), ''insect bites'', or lymphangitis (swelling and inflammation of lymph nodes) and can be distinguished by obtaining a careful medical history and physical examination by a physician. Sometimes, a biopsy of the skin may be required to establish the definite diagnosis.' "
How is phlebitis managed and treated?,"'Treatment of phlebitis may depend on the location, extent, symptoms, and underlying medical conditions.''In general, superficial phlebitis of the upper and lower extremities can be treated by applying warm compresses, elevation of the involved extremity, encouraging ambulation (walking), and oral anti-inflammatory medications (''ibuprofen'' [''Motrin'', ''Advil''], ''diclofenac'' [''Voltaren'', ''Cataflam'', Voltaren-XR], etc.). Topical anti-inflammatory medications may also be beneficial, such as diclofenac gel. External compression with fitted stockings is also a recommended for patients with superficial phlebitis of the lower extremities.''If an intravenous catheter is the cause, then it should be removed. If the phlebitis is infected, then antibiotics are used. In severe cases of infected thrombophlebitis, surgical exploration may be necessary.''Superficial thrombophlebitis (blood clots) is evaluated by an ultrasound to exclude deep venous thrombophlebitis, especially those involving the saphenous vein. If deep venous thrombophlebitis is suspected or diagnosed, or if its risk of developing is considerable, then anti-coagulation (thinning of blood) may be necessary. This is typically done by injection of low molecular weight ''heparin'' (''enoxaparin'' [''Lovenox'']), or by injection of fondaparinux (''Arixtra''). It can be done by treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (usually in the form of an intravenous drip), followed by oral anti-coagulation with ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') for about 3 to 6 months. Newer ''anticoagulants'' may replace Coumadin in certain circumstances.''Patients with extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may be appropriately treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis in selected cases, but will still require maintenance anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months.''Selected patients with DVT may require placement of inferior vena cava filters to help prevent pulmonary embolus. In a subset of patients, it may be appropriate to remove the filter at a future date.''Recovery of symptoms from superficial phlebitis can last a few weeks. A thrombophlebitis may take weeks to months to recover.'  "
What are the complications of phlebitis?,"'Complications of phlebitis may include local infection and ''abscess'' formation, clot formation, and progression to a deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. When pronounced deep venous thrombophlebitis has seriously damaged the leg veins, this can lead to post-phlebitic syndrome. Post-phlebitic syndrome is characterized by chronic swelling of the involved leg and can be associated with ''leg pain'', discoloration, and ulcers.' "
How can you prevent phlebitis?,"'Simple measures can be taken to prevent phlebitis, although, sometimes it cannot be avoided.''Preventive measures of phlebitis include:''Compression stockings are required in many patients after an episode of phlebitis, especially deep venous phlebitis. These, and other measures, reduce post-phlebitic swelling and the risk of recurrent phlebitis. In most hospitalized patients who have limited mobility or have had recent orthopedic surgery, a low dose of blood thinners (heparin, fondaparinux, enoxaparin [Lovenox] or other agents) may be injected routinely in order to prevent blood clot formation by keeping the blood relatively thin. This preventive dose is generally lower than the doses used for treating existing blood clots. A widely used alternative is the use of intermittent compression garments on the extremities during periods of high risk.' early mobilization after surgery, leg exercises during a long car travel or airplane ride, good nursing hygiene and prompt removal of intravenous catheters, and smoking cessation."
What is a phobia? What are the different kinds of phobias?,"'A phobia is defined as the persistent fear of a situation, activity, or thing that causes the sufferer to want to avoid it. The three types of phobias are''Phobias are largely underreported, probably because many people with phobias find ways to avoid the situations that they fear. Therefore, statistics for how many people have phobias vary widely. Phobias are fairly common. Women are thought to be twice as likely to develop a phobia than men.''Some of the most common phobias include''Agoraphobia often coexists with panic disorder.'  social phobia (fear of public speaking, meeting new people, or other social situations), agoraphobia (fear of being outside), and specific phobias (fear of particular items or situations). fears of public speaking or other social situations (social phobia or social anxiety disorder), open spaces (agoraphobia), closed-in spaces (claustrophobia), the dark, clowns (coulrophobia), flying (aerophobia), blood, birds (ornithophobia) or all animals (zoophobia), commitment (gamophobia), driving (xenophobia), snow (chionophobia), spiders (arachnophobia) and bugs, needles (aichmophobia), snakes (ophidiophobia), death, math, heights (acrophobia or altophobia), bridges or tunnels, germs (mysophobia), and having dental work done (dentophobia). Fears of midgets, haunted houses, long words, helmets, pickles, feet, and phobias of holes are just a few unusual fears/phobias and may be considered weird or strange by some but can be just as debilitating as those phobias that are more common."
What are the complications of phobias?,"""If not treated, a phobia can worsen to the point in which the person's quality of life is seriously impaired, both by the phobia itself and/or by attempts to avoid or hide it. For example, a ""'fear of flying'' can result in the sufferer being unable to travel. Some people have problems with their relationships, have failed in school, and/or been unable to maintain employment as the result of a severe phobia. While there may be periods of spontaneous improvement, a phobia does not usually go away unless the individual gets treatments that are specifically designed to address this condition. Alcoholics can be up to 10 times more likely to develop a phobia than nonalcoholics, and phobic individuals may be twice as likely to suffer from ''alcoholism'' or another ''addiction'' than those who have never been phobic. It has even been found that phobic ''anxiety'' can be life-threatening for some people, increasing the risk of suffering from ''heart disease'' in both men and women.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for phobias?,"'While there is no single known cause for phobias, they are thought to run in families, be influenced by culture and how one is parented and can be triggered by different life events. Immediate family members of phobia sufferers are about three times more likely to also have a phobia than those who do not have such a family history. People whose parents either were overly protective or were distant in raising them may be at more risk of developing phobias. Phobia sufferers tend to be more likely to manage stress by avoiding the stressful situation and have trouble decreasing the intensity of the fearful situation. Another possible contributor to the development of phobias is classical conditioning. In classical conditioning, an individual responds to something that scares them by generalizing the fear of that specific thing or situation to more generalized things or situations. For example, a person may respond to a real threat by one dog to developing a phobia of all ''dogs''.'  "
What are phobia symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of phobias often involve having a ''panic attack'' -- in that they include feelings of intense fear, dread, or terror, despite understanding that those feelings are out of proportion to any real threat -- in addition to physical symptoms like ''tremors'', ''sweating'', ""mind going blank,"" ''nausea'', rapid heartbeat, trouble ''breathing'', and an overwhelming desire to withdraw from the situation that is causing the phobic reaction. Also, extreme measures are sometimes taken to prevent or leave the situation.'  "
How do health-care professionals diagnose phobias?,"'Many health-care providers may assess for the diagnosis of phobias, including licensed mental-health therapists, family doctors, or other primary-care medical providers, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. If one of these practitioners suspects that you may have a phobia, you will likely be asked a number of questions to explore all the symptoms you may be having and you may need to have a medical interview and physical examination. A phobia may co-occur with a number of other mental-health problems, including ''schizophrenia'', ''depression'', ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''), and substance-abuse disorders.''Phobias are particularly associated with other ''anxiety'' disorders. In addition to panic disorder, examples of other ''anxiety'' disorders include ''generalized anxiety disorder'' (''GAD'') and ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''). In children, school phobia or a fear of being alone may occur with or without ''separation anxiety'' disorder. As ''anxiety'' disorders in general may co-occur with a number of medical conditions or can be a reaction to various medications, routine laboratory tests are often done during the initial evaluation to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.' "
What is the treatment for phobias?,"'Helping phobia sufferers is thought to be most effective when ''psychotherapy'' and medications that are specific to the treatment of phobia are both used. One type of mental-health therapy involves the supportive and gradual exposure of the person with phobias to situations that are increasingly similar to the one they are phobic about (desensitization). These circumstances can either include actual or computer-generated anxiety-provoking stimuli.''Cognitive behavioral therapy (''CBT'') has been found to often quite effectively decrease phobic symptoms by helping the person with the illness change his or her way of thinking. CBT uses three techniques to accomplish this goal:''Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are often used to treat phobias, especially when desensitization and CBT are inadequately effective. These medications enhance levels of serotonin in the brain. Examples of these medications include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (''Brintellix''), and vilazodone (Viibryd). The possible side effects of these medications can vary greatly from person to person and somewhat depend on which medication is being used. Common side effects of this group of medications include ''dry mouth'', sexual dysfunction, ''nausea'', ''tremors'', trouble sleeping, ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'' or soft stools, and ''dizziness''. Some people gradually gain weight over time. In rare cases, people have been thought to become more acutely more anxious or ''depressed'' on the medication, even trying to or completing ''suicide'' or homicide. Children and ''teens'' are thought to be more vulnerable to this rare side effect compared to adults.''Phobias are also sometimes treated using ''beta-blocker'' medications, which decrease the physical symptoms associated with panic by blocking the effects that adrenaline (epinephrine) has on the body. One example of a beta-blocker is ''propranolol''. These disorders are also sometimes treated with ''drugs'' in a medication class called benzodiazepines or minor tranquilizers. This class of medications causes relaxation but is used with caution these days to treat anxiety due to the possibility of addiction and the risk of overdose, especially if taken when ''alcohol'' is also being consumed. Examples of medications from that group include ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), and ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'').'  Didactic component: This part of treatment involves educating the person about phobias and treatment and helps to establish positive expectations for therapy and promote the cooperation of the individual with a phobia. Cognitive component: It helps to recognize the ideas and assumptions that influence the behavior of the phobia sufferer, especially those that may predispose him or her to developing the disorder. Behavioral component: This uses behavior-modifying techniques to teach the person with a phobia more effective strategies for coping with problems."
What is the prognosis for phobias?,"'Cognitive therapy and exposure therapy alone, in combination, or with relaxation training have been found to be effective in treating phobias. Relaxation training alone has also been found to be effective in treating phobias. While some interventions, like sedating people who are phobic about getting dental work, may be useful in the short term, they may undermine truly overcoming the condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent phobias?,"'Phobia ''prevention'"" that involves educating people with this illness, their loved ones, and other involved individuals like children's teachers have been found to be effective in preventing phobias from ever occurring."" "
How can people cope with phobias?,"'Ways that individuals with a phobia can work toward overcoming their fears include talking about their phobia, refraining from avoiding situations they find stressful, imagining themselves facing their fears (visualization), and making positive statements to themselves like, ""I will be OK."" In fact, when self-help methods are combined with brief psychotherapy, phobia sufferers may achieve significant improvement in symptoms.' "

What research is being done on phobias?,"'Research studies are focused upon how well phobias respond to various treatments over the long term, as well as how age-related changes in thinking ability (cognition) may interact with anxiety. The use of herbal and other ''dietary supplements'' in the treatment of phobias is being explored, as well.' "
What is photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that utilizes a photosensitizing molecule (frequently a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. Very thin superficial ''skin cancers'' called ''actinic keratoses'' and certain other types of ''cancer'' cells can be eliminated this way. ''Acne'"" can also be treated as well. The procedure is easily performed in a physician's office or outpatient setting. PDT is also referred to as blue light therapy.""'PDT essentially has three steps. First, a light-sensitizing liquid, cream, or intravenous drug (photosensitizer) is applied or administered. Occasionally, a photosensitizing molecule that is already part of the body can be activated. Second, there is an incubation period of minutes to days. Finally, the target tissue is then exposed to a specific wavelength of light that then activates the photosensitizing medication. The mechanism by which tissue is destroyed seems to depend on the presence of activated oxygen molecules.''Steps:''Although first used in the early 1900s, PDT in the modern sense is a new, evolving science. Current PDT involves a variety of incubation times for different the light-sensitizing ''drugs'' and a variety of light sources depending on the target tissue. The basic premise of PDT is selective tissue destruction.''At present, the primary limitation of available PDT technology for skin is the depth of penetration of the light and ability to target cells within 1/3 of an inch (approximately 1 cm) of the light source. Therefore, tumors or atypical growths must be close to the surface of the skin for PDT to work.''PDT is currently used in a number of medical fields, including ''oncology'' (''cancer''), dermatology (skin), ''cosmetic surgery'', ophthalmology, and oral medicine.''In oncology, PDT is FDA approved for ''non-small cell lung cancer'', ''esophageal cancer'', and ''precancerous'"" changes of Barrett's ""'esophagus''. Its use is also being further investigated through ''clinical trials'' in general oncology for conditions including ''cancers'' of the cervix (mouth of uterus), ''prostate gland'', brain, and peritoneal ''cavity'' (the abdominal space that contains the stomach, ''liver'', and internal organs).''In dermatology, PDT with the photosensitizer Levulan Kerastick (20% delta-aminolevulinic acid HCl) is used for the treatment of very early, thin skin cancers called actinic keratoses (AK). The initial approval was specifically for the treatment of ''actinic keratosis'' of the face and ''scalp'' with application of the photosensitizer followed by a timed exposure to a special blue light source. PDT has also used for ''acne'', ''rosacea'', thin nonmelanoma skin cancers, sun damage, enlarged sebaceous glands, ''wrinkles'', ''warts'', ''hidradenitis suppurativa'', ''psoriasis'', and many other ''skin conditions''. It is not used to remove ''moles'' or ''birthmarks''. '   application of photosensitizer drug incubation period light activation"
What photosensitizer drugs are available?,"'FDA-approved photosensitizers include porfimer sodium (Photofrin), 5-aminolevulinic acid or ALA (Levulan), and methyl aminolevulinate [MAOP] (Metvix). More drugs may become available in the near future. Photofrin is used intravenously for internal cancers while Levulan and Metvix are applied topically for skin therapy.' "
"What light sources are available, and how are they applied?","'PDT light sources include laser light, intense pulsed light, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), blue light, red light, and many other visible lights (including natural sunlight). Photosensitizer drugs may become activated by one or several types of light. The optimal light source depends on the ideal wavelength for the particular drug used and target tissue.''The light source needs to be directly applied to the target tissue for an appropriate amount of time. For surface skin treatments, the light is directly applied to the area of the skin where the photosensitizer drug has been applied (such as face, scalp, arms, etc.). For internal cancers, delivering the light to the desired area is more challenging. The light may be delivered through small ''fiber''-optic cables into the body ''cavity'' or area being treated. Sometimes, endoscopes (a thin, lighted, elongated tube that is inserted into a body space) are used to deliver the light into the ''lungs'', stomach, or bladder.' "
How does photodynamic therapy work?,"'PDT works by direct injury to the target cells and tissues. This involves the production of an activated oxygen molecule that can injure or destroy nearby cells. Because the normal skin barrier is not present at the sites of the actinic keratoses, photosensitizing molecule is preferentially absorbed there and then activated by light. The activated oxygen destroys the adjacent abnormal tissue. Once the areas have healed following PDT, the areas are reexamined to see if additional treatments or biopsies are needed.''With traditional cryosurgery (freezing with liquid nitrogen), only the visible actinic keratoses can be treated. Since many actinic keratoses are often not evident, PDT might be preferable since it presumably would destroy these ""subclinical"" lesions. PDT allows for treatment of an entire area of sun damage simultaneously, but subsequent treatments may be necessary.' "
Does PDT make me permanently more sensitive to light?,"'No, PDT causes a temporary ''sensitivity to light'', including natural sunlight and some indoor lights. The light sensitivity resolves with time, depending on both the photosensitizer drug and dosage used.''Light avoidance is generally required after PDT. The duration depends on the drug and dosage used. Intravenous porphyrin may make the body, including the skin and eyes, sensitive to light for about 6 weeks after treatment. Proper protection, including long sleeves and ''sunglasses'', may be required. Topically applied aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate may cause skin sensitivity only on the treatment areas for approximately 24-72 hours. These do not usually cause sensitivity on other body parts other than where the drug was directly applied. Your physician will need to discuss with you the required sun- and light-avoidance period required after your particular treatment.' "
How is PDT used to treat the skin?,"'PDT using Levulan and a proprietary blue light is currently FDA approved for the treatment of early skin precancers called actinic keratoses (rough scaly spots generally on sun-exposed skin). PDT is also known as ""ALA/PDT treatment"" or ""Super Blue Light."" It has been referred to as a ""super photo facial"" when the photosensitizer is used with a machine called intense pulsed light or IPL. These treatments may help remove sun-damaged precancerous skin. Sun damage, fine lines, and blotchy pigmentation may also be improved because of the positive effect of PDT. PDT seems to reduce oil gland function and so is helpful in treating ''acne'' and ''rosacea''.'""Although PDT's use in skin was first investigated in 1990s for ""'actinic keratosis'"", it was not as popular or widely used because of the required long incubation times (usually 18-24 hours) and limited indications. Since approximately 2001, PDT has become more widespread primarily because of advances including shorter incubation times (30-60 minutes). In Europe, studies utilizing the exposure to ambient sunlight after application of the photosensitizer and a chemical sunblock (to prevent exposure to ultraviolet light) seemed to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratoses. This could eliminate the need for treatment to be administered in a physician's office."" "
What is a typical skin PDT session like?,"'You may be given a written procedure consent form to read and sign before your first treatment. The medical staff may take some pretreatment photography prior to applying the photosensitizer medication.''In the treatment room, you may be sitting or comfortably lying back on a table. Often a thorough cleansing of the face is done using ''alcohol'' and or acetone to degrease the skin.''The photosensitizer liquid or cream is applied topically to the whole area being treated (such as the entire face, scalp, back of the hands, back part of the forearms, legs, ''feet'', scalp, chest, or back).''The medication is allowed to air dry for a few minutes, and then you will wait anywhere from 30-60 minutes for the incubation time. Some areas such as chest, back, and particularly forearms and legs require longer incubation times of 2 to 18 hours, depending on skin pigmentation and anatomical site. PDT requires physician adjustments for specific individualized incubation times and treatment durations.''After the proper incubation time, you are exposed to the light source. There may be sensations of warmth, tingling, heat, or burning in some patients. A fan can be used to help cool off during the treatment. The treatment area is then washed off and ''sunscreen'' applied. Instructions are given on how to care for the skin at home.' "
"How much improvement can I expect with 
photodynamic therapy?","'No two individuals are the same, and results may vary. Some conditions can improve dramatically in some patients and not respond in others.''Overall, patients with severely ''sun-damaged skin'' with actinic ''keratosis'', mottled pigmentation, dull or sallow skin, and skin laxity, may see good to excellent improvement with PDT. There can be improvement of large pores, non-pitted ''acne'' ''scars'', and active acne.''Depending on the area being treated and the recommended incubation time, different numbers of treatment sessions spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart may be required to achieve the desired improvement and reduction in lesions. On average, a series of two to three treatments are performed. It is not always possible to predict ahead of time how many treatments your specific condition may take or how you will respond to PDT.''After photodynamic sun avoidance for 24-48 hours is necessary.' "
"Where can I have photodynamic therapy, and who performs the procedure?","""Photodynamic therapy for skin disease is usually comfortably performed in an outpatient setting like a doctor's office and without any sedation or anesthesia. You may check the ""'www.AAD.org'' for board-certified dermatologist members of the American Board of Dermatology in your area. Additionally, oncologists and other physicians may be trained in this area.''Most skin PDT is performed only by specially trained dermatologists and their medical staff. Other physicians, including oncologists, family physicians, internal medicine doctors, ''plastic'' surgeons, or ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons and their medical staff who are trained, may also perform photodynamic therapy.' "
What are the advantages with photodynamic therapy for treating actinic keratoses?,"'The greatest advantage of PDT is the ability to selectively treat an entire area of skin damage and precancerous actinic keratoses (blanket or field treatment). PDT generally decreases the likelihood of lighter or darker skin spots (post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation) caused by routine freezing with liquid nitrogen. Additionally, PDT frequently may facilitate smoother skin and an overall improved appearance, tone, color, and enhanced skin texture.''In several studies, PDT has been preferred by many patients for ease of use and rapid recovery as compared to alternative treatments including freezing and topical fluorouracil (''Efudex''). The PDT side effects may be milder with less downtime than with fluorouracil.''For patients with many skin lesions, PDT may be generally more effective than repeated spot treatment with topical liquid nitrogen. Some patients are unable to tolerate the prolonged treatment required with fluorouracil or imiquimod (''Aldara'') because of the irritation, redness, and possible downtime with these topical creams. PDT is very well-tolerated, noninvasive (no needles or surgery required) procedure to help reduce sun damage and enhance the overall cosmetic outcome (particularly in sensitive areas of the face and chest).' "
Am I a good candidate for photodynamic therapy?,"'The best candidates for PDT may be those with lighter or fair skin with sun damage.''You may not be a good candidate for photodynamic therapy if you have darker skin that tends to turn brown or discolor with certain light or laser treatments. You may also not be a good candidate for PDT if you are very sensitive to light, ''burn'' extremely easily, would be unable to stay out of sunlight for the required 24-48 hours, or are taking medications which may make you very sensitive to sunlight or light-based therapies. People with certain medical diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'') may not be candidates for PDT because of increased risk of burning from the light exposure.''Your decision on the best treatment choice may depend on different factors such as the location and type of skin lesions, your past treatments, your overall health, and level of comfort. Your physician can help you sort through the different treatments.''Your physician needs to know of any other medical conditions that may affect your procedure or overall ''wound'' healing. You would want to make sure to tell your physician beforehand if you have any extreme sensitivity to light-based treatments, take medications which make you very sensitive to light, have had a problem or bad effect from prior PDT, have ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', or suffer from a condition called ''porphyria''. During the exposure to light, there is a moderately uncomfortable burning sensation that most patients seem to tolerate without additional ''pain'' medication.''Your PDT physician needs to know if you have had a history of ''staph'' or other skin infections in the recent past. You will also want to advise your physician if you have a history of frequent ''cold sores'' (''herpes'' virus infections on your face). In that case, you may be prescribed an antiviral tablet (''cold''-sore ''prevention'' pill) to take before and after your procedure. You may be asked to wash with a special antibiotic soap or wash.''Patients may need to also advise their physician of any drug ''allergies'' such as to topical anesthetics or other photosensitizers. Additionally, the surgeon may need to know of any bleeding or ''bruising'' tendencies, ''hepatitis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', or ''pregnancy''.''Your physician will want to know of any factors that may affect your surgery or wound healing.'  "
What growths is PDT not good for?,'PDT is not as effective for thick actinic keratoses due to the inability of the photosensitizer drug to penetrate into the depths of the lesion. These growths may need to be destroyed using some other technique.' 
What are possible complications or side effects of photodynamic therapy?,"'Overall, most patients tolerate the minor procedure very well without any complications. However, PDT is associated with some possible minor risks and complications. Since an exaggerated light-sensitive reaction is expected by definition of PDT, most patients understand and expect some type of a ''sunburn'' or red reaction after skin PDT. Not everyone gets a ''sunburn'' reaction, however. Some patients may have no visible reaction or redness.''Possible risks and complications of photodynamic therapy include burning of the treated area, skin discoloration, skin redness, prominent tiny blood vessels (telangiectasia), ''pain'', infection, cold-sore activation, ''blisters'', scabs, unsightly scars, cosmetic disfigurement, skin discoloration, eye injury or swelling, ''allergic'' reactions, prolonged sun sensitivity, and reaction to topical anesthesia.''Minor, serious, or life-threatening reactions can occur with the use of anesthetics or with medications given before, after, or during a procedure.' "
Is there scarring from photodynamic therapy?,"'No, PDT usually does not leave scars in typical cases. Overall when you undergo PDT, there will be some type of a red skin reaction and irritation for 3 to 10 days after the treatment. Some people are more sensitive to PDT and the light treatment than others. Similarly, some people heal better or faster than others. Some residual redness may be more noticeable depending on the location and skin type. Some people may have temporary skin discoloration that may last weeks to months. Patients with darker skin types may have more skin discoloration after treatment.' "
What are alternatives for photodynamic therapy?,"'It is important to understand that as with any medical treatment, there are alternative treatments to PDT. You may want to discuss alternative treatment options with your doctor at your consultation appointment.''There are many options for treatment of an actinic keratosis (AK), including but not limited to freezing (''cryotherapy'' or cryosurgery), burning, chemical peels, creams (like fluorouracil and immune modulator creams like imiquimod), local destruction by curettage and desiccation (scrape and ''burn''), and other choices depending on the skin condition.''In acne, there are many alternatives to PDT, including oral ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane), oral antibiotics, topical washes, acne facials, and many acne creams.' "
What about insurance coverage and costs of photodynamic therapy?,"""Photodynamic therapy is currently considered a medical service for the treatment of some conditions, particularly for actinic keratosis. However, it may be considered cosmetic, off' label, or not medically indicated for conditions for which it is regularly used.""'Currently, some insurance plans cover the procedure under their provided benefits. However, with the many changes in insurance plans, it is always advisable to contact your insurance carrier prior to scheduling any treatment and confirm your eligibility and benefits.''Photodynamic therapy, like any procedure, will result in additional procedure charges above the routine office-visit fees. These fees may range from two to several hundred dollars depending on the area, number of treatments, and the type of insurance you purchase. The greater number of treatments and greater the amount of photosensitizer medication required, the higher the cost.''Insurance benefits vary, and reimbursement depends on what benefits you have contracted for with your insurance company. Currently, Medicare generally typically covers 80% of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses. If you have a secondary insurance plan, that may help cover the remaining 20% not covered by Medicare.''Standard commercial or non-Medicare insurances currently generally may cover a large percentage of PDT for actinic kurtosis unless you have to meet an out-of-pocket deductible first. You may want to get to know and understand your insurance benefits before having surgery. In many cases, you may also ask the billing office at the medical center or your insurance coordinator for an approximate estimate of your charges before scheduling the procedure.' "
How do I prepare for my procedure?,"'Your personal physician and their medical personnel will likely let you know the preoperative instructions specific for your condition.'""For many typical PDT procedures in a physician's office, most patients are advised to come in with a clean, washed area without any lotions or ""'makeup''. You may generally eat your regular ''diet'' on the day of their procedure and take all of your regular daily medications. Your skin should be fully clean and free of all makeup, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Bring a wide-brimmed hat (6 inches), sunglasses, and scarf when appropriate to the appointment. Patients are advised to wear comfortable casual clothes and bring a wide-brimmed hat for facial or scalp treatments. You should bring gloves or a long-sleeve shirt if having hands or forearms treated.''In nearly all cases, patients are usually able to drive after most procedures and do not necessarily need a driver unless they feel uncomfortable or have taken any sedative medications.''Since you will be in the office for generally at least one hour, you may want to bring some personal snacks, ''drinks'', and reading or knitting material. Personal music headsets may also provide relaxation and help pass time during your PDT application, incubation time, and treatment.''Most patients continue all prescribed medications, including ''aspirin'' and any blood thinners unless specifically advised otherwise only by the doctor.''While there is no absolute contraindication, ''smoking'' is discouraged for at least a few days before and 1 to 2 weeks after your procedure. As with any procedure, ''smoking'' can slow down wound healing and cause an increased risk of wound infections.''Heavy alcohol use is not advised at least a few days before PDT. Heavy alcohol use can cause more bleeding and thin your blood. An occasional glass of wine or small cocktail may not cause severe bleeding.' "
How is recovery after photodynamic therapy (PDT)?,"'Recovery is usually fairly easy and uneventful. Many patients have mild dryness and a faint to mild sunburn of the treated area. A small percent of patients may have moderate or marked discomfort and a harder recovery because of more skin dryness, redness, or burning.''Some of these patients have had inadvertent sun exposure even as short as a minute or two during their immediate post-treatment time, causing a more severe reaction.''You will want to plan to stay indoors and avoid any sunlight for 24-48 hours as directed by your physician. Overall, you may be able to resume all normal indoor activities the first day.''Most patients are able to their normal activities 24-48 hours after photodynamic therapy. Avoiding direct sunlight for the first 1 to 2 days in crucial to avoiding getting an exuberant (red) response. Your physician will need to let you know what activity precautions are required based on the area and size of your procedure.' "
Is there pain after PDT?,"'Typically, there is little pain with PDT. No two individuals are exactly the same, and individual reactions and tolerance to discomfort levels vary. Most patients report mild skin irritation including minimal to mild dryness and tight feeling of their skin after PDT. This discomfort is usually improved with frequent application of bland topical emollients or plain Vaseline.'""A small number of patients may actually complain that they felt nothing and didn't have any pain or peeling. Less commonly, a small percentage of patients for various reasons may have significant pain, a very exaggerated sunburn response, moderate overall discomfort, and pain from the tightness and warmth of the skin.""'If there is pain, many patients find that they prefer to take something for pain at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the pain builds up to an unbearable level. If you have mild or moderate pain, your doctor may advise you to take ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or another ''pain reliever''. Rarely, prescription pain medications may be required for severe pain.''Your physician will let you know what pain medications are recommended for your specific condition.' "
How do I take care of my treatment area after photodynamic therapy?,"'It is generally required to check with your doctor for their specific ''wound care'' instructions before your procedure. Often, you will be asked to go home and stay indoors for the rest of the day. Your physician will usually give you more detailed instructions depending on the area and size of the procedure.''Many physicians suggest you shower and wash the area immediately and as often as you would like. Wound care may require gently washing the area with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide two to three times a day and applying an ''over-the-counter'' antibiotic ointment or a nonirritating moisturizer like Purpose, Cetaphil, or Aquaphor to the area. Avoidance of harsh or abrasive cleansers is advised. Picking or scrubbing the skin could cause in severe irritation or scarring.''Most patients are advised to try to avoid applying makeup or powder directly on a fresh or ''open wound'"" unless the surface is fully healed. A nonirritating sunscreen such as zinc or titanium may be applied immediately after the procedure before leaving the physician's office. Sunscreens are ideally also applied twice a day after PDT. It is important to follow your own physician's instructions for wound care.""'Mild to moderate redness and or swelling is not uncommon the first day or two after PDT and can be lessened by application of an ice bag, ice cubes, or ice chips in a small Ziploc bag, or frozen peas in their bag. Applying cool packs or ice every 5 to 15 minutes every hour for the first 8 to 24 hours after your procedure may be very soothing. Swelling may be more common for procedures around the eyes or lips. Sleeping propped up on a few pillows or in a reclining chair may help decrease swelling after treatment of the head and face area.'""Your physician should be notified of any infections, cold-sore outbreaks, extreme swelling, or other unexpected reactions. Rarely, a visit to the physician's office may be necessary for severe swelling or infection. Oral antibiotics, cortisone creams or tablets, or other medications may be required for adverse reactions.""'Your physician will need to know if pain is increasing after one to two days after your procedure or if you are having ''fever'"" or other concerning symptoms. In such cases, you may need to be seen at the physician's office."" "
"What is the chance that my actinic 
keratoses will recur?","'While PDT is a very effective treatment, there is a reasonable chance that you may continue to need periodic treatments for actinic keratoses, depending on your individual skin, severity of prior sun damage, and your compulsion to avoid the sun.''Actinic keratoses may recur or a new ''cancer'' may develop in the same or adjacent area even after photodynamic therapy or other treatments. Some skin actinic keratoses are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up.''Sun-damaged skin frequently needs follow-up and possible further treatment. Several studies have shown that photodynamic therapy tends to have a cure rate comparable to the traditional treatment with fluorouracil (''Carac'', Efudex, and ''Fluoroplex'').''It is important to note that PDT is not curative in invasive ''skin cancer''. This may require one or more procedures such as biopsy, surgery, ''radiation'', or other procedures to fully treat those lesions.''Follow-up appointments with your dermatologist or physician are very important, especially in the first few years after photodynamic therapy. Many patients are seen every 4 to 6 months after their diagnosis of actinic keratoses of the skin.''Self-skin examinations monthly are good practice for patients with a history of ''skin cancer''. Any changing or new growth should be promptly checked by your physician. More regular follow-up appointments may be needed for those with more aggressive tumors or tumors in high-risk areas. Your physician will recommend the proper follow-up for your specific condition.' "
What is photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)?,"'Photorefractive ''keratectomy'' (PRK) is ''laser eye surgery'' that reduces the need for corrective ''eyewear'' by reshaping the ''cornea'"" of the eye, thereby changing the way the eye focuses light on the retina. An excimer laser ablates (removes) a thin layer of the cornea at its surface, changing the cornea's refractive (focusing) power.""'LASIK'' (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis) eye surgery is a similar procedure except first a medical professional creates a flap within the cornea with either a laser or a microkeratome blade and then performs the ablation below the flap, deeper in the cornea. In ''LASEK'' (laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis), a medical professional makes a thinner flap of just the outer layer (epithelium) and performs the ablation under the epithelium. There are pros and cons to weigh in choosing between ''LASIK'', LASEK, and PRK. In terms of cost, photorefractive keratectomy is usually less expensive than LASIK. Postoperative discomfort is typically less of an issue with LASIK. Ultimately, the choice comes down to which procedure will produce the most safe and reliable outcome, and factors such as corneal health and degree of refractive error determine this.' "
What vision problems does photorefractive keratectomy treat?,"'PRK can treat a variety of refractive errors, including ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness''), ''hyperopia'' (''farsightedness''), and ''astigmatism'"" (imperfection in the eye's curvature of the cornea or ""'lens'""). The laser treats certain medical conditions affecting the eye's surface (for example, Salzmann's nodules and recurrent erosions). When physicians use the laser for these indications, the procedure is referred to as phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)."" "
Who is a good candidate for PRK?,"'The ideal candidate is someone whose corneal tissue is well suited for the procedure. Patients must first meet several criteria. For example, corneal thickness is important. Larger corrections require more tissue ablation so thin corneas may not be suitable for refractive surgery, particularly in patients with very high ''myopia''. The surgeon will calculate if there will be sufficient residual corneal tissue to perform the ablation safely.''The eye doctor reviews the medical history and performs a complete eye examination to look for any ''eye problems'' or medical conditions that might affect the outcome of refractive surgery. Poor eye health or certain medical diseases (for example, uncontrolled ''diabetes'') may increase the risk of a poor outcome.'""Age is another factor. If a candidate's eyes are still growing (for example, in childhood and in the teen years), the refractive error may not have stabilized. Undergoing photorefractive keratectomy too soon may only provide a temporary correction of the refractive error, since the eye is still changing."" "
What are the potential side effects and complications of PRK?,"'Common side effects in the days following the PRK procedure include discomfort, ''dry eye'', foreign body sensation (gritty or sandy feeling), ''blurred vision'', and glare or haloes around lights. These symptoms tend to resolve as the eye heals. Visual recovery takes a few days, and the final uncorrected visual acuity (vision without glasses) typically stabilizes after a few months.''Long-term under-correction or overcorrection can result from variable healing rates, inaccuracies in calculations, or unstable refractive errors.''Uncommon but potentially serious complications include infection, irregular shape, and thinning of the cornea (ectasia), elevated ''intraocular pressure'' (sometimes related to postoperative steroid eyedrops), scarring, or persistent corneal erosions. These complications could result in visual blurring or glare, ''vision loss'', light sensitivity, or ''pain''. These complications have become less common with improvements in preoperative screening, more sophisticated laser ablation profiles, and better medication regimens for optimized healing.' "
How do I prepare for PRK?,"'The eye surgeon first determines if your eyes are suitable for PRK surgery in the preoperative screening.''You may be asked to refrain from wearing hard (rigid) ''contact lenses'' for up to several weeks or soft contact lenses for several days in preparation for both the preoperative screening and the procedure itself. This is important because contact lenses can temporarily reshape the cornea. You will want your cornea to be in its “natural,” unaltered state when being measured preoperatively and when being treated.''On the day of PRK surgery, do not wear ''makeup'' or perfume. Be sure to have your postoperative medications ready and review the instructions for their use.' "
What happens during the PRK procedure?,"'Typically, the patient lies on his/her back. A small lid speculum holds the eyelids open. Once the eye is numbed with anesthetic drops, the surgeon removes the outer layer (epithelium) of the cornea either mechanically (with a tiny brush or a sweeping tool) or with laser. Once the surgeon removes the epithelium, laser is applied to the surface of the cornea to precisely ablate (remove) a thin layer of corneal tissue based on the amount of myopic, hyperopic, or ''astigmatic'' correction desired. A clicking or tapping sound might be heard as the laser fires. Once the laser ablation is complete, the surgeon places a contact lens. Medical professionals remove this ""bandage"" contact lens once the epithelium heals, typically a few days later (about three to five days). The postoperative medicated eye drops are used with the contact lens in place.' "
What follow-up care do people need after PRK? What is the recovery time for PRK?,"'At the completion of your surgery, you will need someone to drive for you. You can expect to be very light sensitive, so be sure to have ''sunglasses'' with you.''Medical professionals will instruct you to use prescription medicated eyedrops afterward. These may include steroids, anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', and antibiotics. The drops are very important for healing well. They serve to control inflammation and prevent infection, as well as to minimize discomfort.''You can expect a mild to moderate amount of ''eye pain'' (light sensitivity, foreign body sensation) for the first few days as the epithelium heals. You may need to take oral medication for ''pain''.''Close monitoring of the healing process is also very important. Be sure to keep all scheduled follow-up appointments. The number and frequency of follow-up visits will depend on how quickly the eye heals. It may take several weeks to three months to reach your best corrected vision (stable refraction).' "
What is the prognosis after a photorefractive keratectomy?,"'Generally, the success rate is very good. Assuming there are no underlying medical conditions that could adversely affect the healing process, the surface of the eye (epithelium) usually heals in a few days, achieving a stable refraction in the weeks and months following the procedure. Because the surgeon made no flap, there are no concerns about the flap-related complications sometimes seen after LASIK surgery.''Over time, there may be a need to use corrective eyewear again, either because some of the corrective effect regresses or because the underlying refractive error was still in flux and had not stabilized completely prior to the procedure. Re-treatment with further photorefractive keratectomy is often possible at a later date.''Patients over the age of 40 who correct their distance vision with photorefractive keratectomy will still need to use reading glasses when ''presbyopia'' sets in. ''Presbyopia'' is the inability to see well close-up due to age-related changes in the eye\'s lens. Patients over 40 who already have presbyopia can opt to have one eye corrected for distance while having the other eye corrected for near. This is called ""monovision."" The eye doctor will discuss these options with you in the preoperative screening.' "
What Is the Goal of Physical Therapy?,"'The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. ''Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. ''Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use ''walking'' aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. ' "
What Are Some Benefits of Occupational and Physical Therapy?,"'If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: ' You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well 
	informed. If you are overweight, a dietary plan can be created to reduce the 
	stress of excess weight on supporting joints of the back, legs, and feet. As 
	yet, no specific diet -- other than a diet designed for weight loss -- has 
	proved helpful for arthritis. You gain foot-care advice, including choice of well-fitting shoes with 
	shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly 
	to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve 
	performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications."
What Techniques Will I Learn?,"""You'll learn several techniques, including:"" Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise. Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change."
What Therapy Is Offered for People Recovering From Joint Replacement?,"'Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery.' "
What Joint Protection Techniques Are Offered?,"'There are ways to reduce the ''stress'' on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: ''An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: ' Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing 
	joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back 
	and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job 
	instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for 
	a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday 
	and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is 
	wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already 
	painful or stiff. Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or 
	tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller 
	joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap 
	rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting 
	dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy 
	loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, 
	squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate 
	methods or tools can usually be found."
What Are Assistive Devices for Arthritis?,"'If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work.''A few examples of helpful devices include a bath ''stool'' for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is frontotemporal dementia?,"'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Originally known as Pick’s disease, the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century. The current designation of the syndrome groups together Pick’s disease, primary progressive ''aphasia'', and semantic dementia as FTD. Some doctors propose adding ''corticobasal degeneration'' and ''progressive supranuclear palsy'' to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex. These designations will continue to be debated.' "
What are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?,"'As it is defined today, the symptoms of FTD fall into two clinical patterns that involve either (1) changes in behavior, or (2) problems with language.''The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive (disinhibited) or bored and listless (apathetic) and includes''The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral type’s symptoms.''Spatial skills and memory remain intact.'   inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractibility; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation."
Is frontotemporal dementia inherited?,'There is a strong genetic component to the disease; FTD often runs in families.' 
Is there any treatment for frontotemporal dementia?,"'No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of FTD. Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication. ''Antidepressants'' have been shown to improve some symptoms.'  "
What is the prognosis (the outlook) for frontotemporal dementia?,"'The outcome for people with FTD is poor. The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others. Eventually some individuals with FTD will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.'  "
What research is being done on frontotemporal dementia?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and fund research on FTD. Among several research projects, scientists hope to identify novel genes involved with FTD, perhaps leading to therapeutic approaches where delivery of normal genes would improve or restore brain function. Clinical imaging may help researchers better understand changes in the brains of people with FTD, as well as help diagnose these disorders. Other projects are aimed at better understanding the toxic effects of protein buildup and how it is related to the development of FTD and related dementias.' "

What causes pelvic inflammatory disease?,"""Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. Usually PID is caused by bacteria from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sometimes PID is caused by normal bacteria found in the vagina. If left untreated, PID can cause problems ""'getting pregnant'', problems during ''pregnancy'', and long-term ''pelvic pain''.' "
How common is pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Each year in the United States, more than 1 million women have an episode of PID. More than 100,000 women become ''infertile'' each year because of PID. Also, many ectopic ''pregnancies'' that occur are due to problems from PID.' "
Are some women more likely to get pelvic inflammatory disease?,'PID affects about 5 percent of women in theUnited States. Your risk for PID is higher if you: '   Have had an STI Have had PID before Are younger than 25 and have sex. PID is most common in women 15 to 24 years old. Have more than one sex partner or have a partner who has multiple sexual partners Douche. Douching can push bacteria into the reproductive organs and cause PID. Douching can also hide the signs of PID  Recently had an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted. The risk of PID is higher for the first few weeks only after insertion of an IUD. PID is rare after that time period. Getting tested for STIs before the IUD is inserted lowers your risk for PID.
What are the signs and symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Many women do not know they have PID, because they do not have any signs or symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can be mild or more serious. Signs and symptoms include:''If you think that you may have PID, see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.'   Pain in the lower abdomen (this is the most common symptom) Fever (100.4 F or higher) Vaginal discharge that may smell foul Painful sex Painful urination Irregular periods Pain in the upper right abdomen"
What is the treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease?,"'Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat PID. Most of the time, at least two antibiotics are used that work against many different types of bacteria. ''You must take all of your antibiotics, even if your symptoms go away.'' This helps to make sure the infection is fully cured. See your doctor or nurse again two to three days after starting the antibiotics to make sure they are working.'  "
What should I do if I think I have an STI (sexually transmitted disease),"'If you think you may have an STI, see a doctor right away.'' You may feel scared or shy about asking for information or help. Keep in mind, the sooner you seek treatment, the less likely the STI will cause you severe harm. And the sooner you tell your sex partner(s) that you have an STI, the less likely they are to infect you again or spread the disease to others.''To learn about STIs or get tested, contact your doctor, local health department, or an STI and ''family planning'' clinic. The American Social Health Association (ASHA) keeps lists of clinics and doctors who provide treatment for STIs. Call ASHA at 800-227-8922. You can get information from the phone line without leaving your name.' "
How can I keep myself from getting PID?,"'You may not be able to prevent PID. It is not always caused by an STI. Sometimes, normal bacteria in your vagina can travel up to your reproductive organs and cause PID. But you can lower your risk of PID by not douching. You can also prevent STIs by not having vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:''The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI.' Use condoms. Condoms are the best way to prevent STIs when you have sex. Because a man does not need to ejaculate (come) to give or get STIs, make sure to put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth, or anus. Other methods of birth control, such as birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STIs. Get tested. Be sure you and your partner are tested for STIs. Talk to each other about the test results before you have sex. Be monogamous. Having sex with just one partner can lower your risk for STIs. After being tested for STIs, be faithful to each other. That means that you have sex only with each other and no one else. Limit your number of sex partners. Your risk of getting STIs goes up with the number of partners you have. Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection. Douching may also raise your risk for PID by helping bacteria travel to other areas, like your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much alcohol or using drugs increases risky behavior and may put you at risk of sexual assault and possible exposure to STIs."
What Is Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)? ,"'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease in which the tissue lining the joints and tendons in the body (synovium) grows abnormally. It is characterized by a noncancerous mass or ''tumor''. There are two types of PVNS:''Symptoms might include:''In some cases, the normal joint structure can be destroyed. The knee is most commonly affected by this condition, though it can occur in other joints such as the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and rarely the jaw. The average age of diagnosis for this condition is 35 years. The cause of PVNS is unknown. Treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor and damaged portions of the synovium.'   the local or nodular form (where the tumor involves the tendons that support the joint, or in one area of the joint) and the diffuse form (where the entire lining of the joint is involved). pain, limitation of movement, and locking of the joint."
What Causes PVNS?,"'The exact cause of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is unknown.''There have been studies suggesting that PVNS could be caused by specific genetic changes in the cells lining the joint. More studies are needed to research this association.' Some doctors believe that it is similar to arthritis, arising from swelling (inflammation) of the joint tissue. Others believe it develops like a tumor, caused by cells growing and multiplying more quickly than usual. The association between a history of trauma and the development of PVNS is unclear. One study found that 56% of individuals with PVNS had a history of previous trauma, while other studies have found a much lower incidence."
What Are the Procedures and Tests of PVNS?,"'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is diagnosed via physician examination, imaging studies, and sometimes surgical procedures. Imaging studies commonly used include: X-ray, ''MRI'', and ''CT scan''. MRI findings are diagnostic in more than 95% of patients. ''CT scan'' findings are additionally often diagnostic, though they might not show the extent of the disease.''Other methods that might be utilized in the diagnostic process include ''joint aspiration'', in which a needle is used to remove fluid from the joint and a biopsy, in which a small operation is completed to obtain a tissue sample.' "
Treatment Options for PVNS,"'Pigmented villonodular synovitis is first treated with surgery to remove as much of the abnormal tissue growth as possible.'   The type of surgery depends on the location and extent of the disease within the joint. Radiation therapy is sometimes used to treat this condition if surgery is not an option, or if the condition returns (recurs) after an initial surgery."
Statistics,"'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is considered rare. Estimates of prevalence may vary depending on the type of PVNS (localized or diffuse). According to a recently published study based on registry data in Denmark, the prevalence in 2012 was 44 per 100,000 people for localized PVNS, and 11 per 100,000 people for diffuse PVNS. This means that PVNS may occur in about 5-6 people out of 10,000 people. We are not aware of recent prevalence estimates of PVNS in the United States.' "
What should you know about hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' (''Piles'') are blood vessels located in the smooth muscles of the walls of the rectum and anus. They are a normal part of the anatomy and are located at the junction where small arteries merge into veins. They are cushioned by smooth muscles and connective tissue and are classified by where they are located in relationship to the pectinate line, the dividing point between the upper 2/3 and lower 1/3 of the anus. This is an important anatomic distinction because of the type of cells that line ''hemorrhoid'', and the nerves that provide sensation.''Internal ''hemorrhoids'' are located above the pectinate line and are covered with cells that are the same as those that line the rest of the ''intestines''. External ''hemorrhoids'' arise below the line and are covered with cells that resemble skin.''Hemorrhoids become an issue only when they begin to swell, causing ''itching'', ''pain'', and/or bleeding.' "
What do external and internal hemorrhoids look like (pictures)?,"'Normal hemorrhoidal tissue cannot be seen since they must first swell and become inflamed or develop a clot to cause symptoms. One can see swollen external hemorrhoids or internal prolapsed hemorrhoids exposed outside the anus but internal hemorrhoids cannot be seen because they remain inside the anus. A thrombosed ''hemorrhoid'' will appear as a lump at the anal verge, protruding from the anus, and will be dark bluish in color because of the ''blood clot'' contained inside the swollen blood vessel. Non-thrombosed hemorrhoids will appear as a rubbery lump. Often more than one swollen hemorrhoid appears at the same time.' "
What causes hemorrhoids?,"'While the presence of hemorrhoids is a reflection of the normal anatomy, most people and care professionals refer to hemorrhoids as an abnormal finding because they only present when they swell and cause problems.''Hemorrhoid swelling occurs when there is an increase in the pressure in the small vessels that make up hemorrhoids causing them to swell and engorge with blood. This causes them to increase in size leading to symptoms. Increased pressure may be caused by a variety of factors:'   A low-fiber diet and smaller caliber stool cause a person to strain when having a bowel movement, increasing the pressure within the blood vessels. Pregnancy is associated with hemorrhoid swelling and is likely due to increased pressure of the enlarged uterus on the rectum and anus. In addition, hormonal changes with pregnancy may weaken the muscles that support the rectum and anus. Prolonged sitting on the toilet may increase pressure within the hemorrhoid blood vessels. Obesity Diarrhea, both acute and chronic Colon cancer Previous rectal surgery Spinal cord injury and lack of erect posture"
What are symptoms and signs of hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:''It is important to remember that ''rectal bleeding'' or ''blood in the stool'' is never normal and, while it may come from a relatively benign cause like hemorrhoids, more serious causes can be life-threatening. These include bleeding from ulcers, ''diverticulitis'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and tumors. If ''rectal bleeding'' occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. This is especially important if the person is taking blood-thinning medications.''When internal hemorrhoid becomes inflamed, it can cause swelling. This in itself does not cause pain because there are no pain fibers attached to the veins above the pectinate line. Passing a hard ''stool'' can scrape off the thinned lining of hemorrhoids causing painless bleeding. However, swollen hemorrhoids can also cause spasm of the muscles that surround the rectum and anus causing pain, especially if they protrude or prolapse through the anus. A lump can be felt at the anal verge. Internal hemorrhoids can also thrombose (clot) leading to severe pain.''Inflamed hemorrhoids can leak ''mucus'' that can cause inflammation of the skin surrounding the anus causing burning and ''itching'', known as pruritis ani. However, other causes of itching include yeast and other skin infections and parasites like ''pinworms''. Most importantly, just as blood in the stool should not be ignored because it might be a sign of colon ''cancer'', ''anal itching'' or bleeding should not be presumed to be due to hemorrhoids because it can be a sign of ''anal cancer'' ''tumor''.''External hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by ""regular skin"" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering hemorrhoids. A hard painful lump can be felt at the anus. External hemorrhoids can also result in excess ''skin tags'' that can be felt at the anal verge and can cause difficulties with cleaning after a bowel movement, leading to secondary skin infections.'

   painless bleeding from the anal area, anal itching, pain in the anal area, swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with inflamed hemorrhoids."
How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?,"'The common symptoms of a hemorrhoid include itching, pain, rectal fullness or lump, and bleeding. The diagnosis is made by history taking and physical examination. The history may focus on the associated symptoms including ''constipation'', hard bowel movements, and straining while going to the toilet. Other questions may be asked to look for other causes of rectal bleeding including tumors, ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and gastrointestinal bleeding.''Physical examination is performed to confirm the diagnosis and includes a rectal examination where a finger is used to feel for abnormal lumps or masses. Interestingly, internal hemorrhoids cannot usually be felt. The rectal exam may be deferred if there is intense pain or swelling. In addition, hemorrhoids and ''constipation'' may be associated with anal fissures or cracks in the skin surrounding the anus. The associated pain and spasm makes a rectal exam very uncomfortable.''If the health care professional is concerned that the symptoms, especially rectal bleeding, cannot be explained by hemorrhoids, anoscopy may be considered. Anoscopy is an office procedure where a lighted tube is inserted to look at the anus. ''Sigmoidoscopy'' or ''colonoscopy'' may be ordered if there is concern that the bleeding is arising from other areas of the colon. These procedures are usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' or surgeon.''Depending upon the situation, blood tests may be ordered. If there has been excessive bleeding, the ''hemoglobin'' or red blood cell count may be checked. If the patient is taking ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), an INR (international normalized ratio) or PT (protime) may be ordered to check for appropriate blood ""thinning.""\xa0Please note that there are many newer anticoagulation medications available to ""thin"" the blood and their activity cannot be measured by routine blood tests.' "
Can natural home remedies treat and prevent hemorrhoids?,"'Regardless of the size or swelling of a hemorrhoid, no treatment is required if symptoms do not exist. ''Prevention'' is perhaps the most effective treatment. ''Diet'' and adequate hydration are very important to maintain normal bowel movements. Hemorrhoid symptoms can occur with the passage of hard stool and ''constipation'', as well as ''diarrhea'' and frequent bowel movements. People with constipation\xa0may require a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and stool softeners. Those with too frequent bowel movements may require\xa0antidiarrheal medications and diet adjustments. These preventive measures decrease the amount of straining that is required to have a bowel movement, thus decreasing the pressure within the blood vessels to prevent swelling.\xa0The internal hemorrhoid always stays protruded or prolapsed and is at risk for thrombosis or strangulation should the anal muscles go into spasm.''Grade 1 hemorrhoids are treated symptomatically. There can be some spasm of the anal muscles. Warm sitz baths, sitting in a warm tub for 20 minutes, two or three times a day may be helpful. Avoiding spicy food may also prevent anal itching. ''Over-the-counter'' medications may be helpful.' "
How are hemorrhoids treated?,"'Once hemorrhoidal symptoms develop, a variety of treatment options exist, depending upon the situation and severity of the hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids are graded by the degree of prolapse below the pectinate line into the anal canal.''Grade 1'': The internal hemorrhoid bulges into the canal but does not prolapse or fall completely into it. These may bleed.''Grade 2'': The hemorrhoid protrudes past the anal verge with straining for a bowel movement or passage of flatus, but spontaneously returns to its original internal position once the straining has subsided.''Grade 3'': The hemorrhoid may protrude past the anal verge without any straining and requires the patient to push them inside manually.'

  "
What medications and other products treat hemorrhoids?,"'Medications are used to control symptoms by softening the stool, decreasing the inflammation of the hemorrhoids, and treating the pain. Stool softeners work by increasing the water and fat content within the stool allowing it to be passed more easily. ''Docusate'' sodium is the most often recommended drug in this class (''Colace'', Surfak, Correctal).''Inflammation can be controlled with over-the-counter creams or suppositories. Some brand ingredients (''Preparation H'') include low dose topical anesthetics to help with symptoms. Others (Anusol, ''witch hazel'') contain astringents that help shrink the swollen tissues. Both may contain low dose steroids (hydrocortisone) to decrease inflammation. People with ''diabetes'' should check with their pharmacist or health care professional before using OTC hemorrhoid treatments. If the medication contains a vasoconstrictor (for example, phenylephrine HCI, ''ephedrine'', or epinephrine) it may elevate blood ''sugar'' levels if absorbed in large amounts. Prescription-strength ''lidocaine'' or hydrocortisone may be offered by the health care professional.''Grade 2 and 3 hemorrhoids are initially treated the same way, using techniques to destroy hemorrhoids. These include injecting the hemorrhoid vein to make it sclerose or harden, using rubber bands to choke off the blood supply and make the hemorrhoidal tissue shrivel, or other procedures that cause the mucosa to shrivel and die.'  "
Will hemorrhoid surgery (hemorrhoidectomy) cure hemorrhoids?,"'People who have failed conservative therapy or who have grade 4 hemorrhoids are candidates for surgery to remove the swollen hemorrhoids and the larger external hemorrhoid skin tags. Options include hemorrhoid removal with laser surgery or hemorrhoidectomy (ectomy=removal) using a scalpel. Another alternative is ''stapled hemorrhoidectomy'', where a special staple gun is positioned to remove hemorrhoids and surround the tissue with a ring of staples to close the area as well as control\xa0the bleeding.''A thrombosed external hemorrhoid indicates that a clot has formed in hemorrhoids causing significant pain. Treatment involves cutting into hemorrhoids to remove the clot and reduce the swelling.'  "
How long does it take for hemorrhoids to go away?,"'Hemorrhoids are normal tissue and only raise concern when they swell, become inflamed or bleed. Hemorrhoids will recur after nonsurgical treatment about 50% of the time, while the recurrence rate after surgery is only 5%. The goal is to control hemorrhoid inflammation by diet and hydration so that surgery is not required. In this respect, hemorrhoids are a life-long condition, to be controlled and not cured.' "
What is a pilonidal cyst?,"'A pilonidal ''cyst'' is a sac filled with debris and hair that occurs in the area at the top of the crease of the buttocks overlying the tailbone (sacrum). This cyst and the overlying skin in the area can become infected, forming a painful abscess.' "
What causes a pilonidal cyst?,"'It is not clear why pilonidal cysts form. At one time, it was thought pilonidal cysts might be congenital (a person is born with them) arising from embryologic cells that were in the wrong place early in development or due to repeat ''trauma'' (jeep driver\'s disease). It is now thought that small groups of hairs and debris (dead skin cells and bacteria) get trapped in the pores of the skin in the upper cleft of the buttock and form a ""sinus,"" or pocket, that grows to become an abscess. This abscess forms under the skin (subcutaneously) and can result in ''scar tissue'' that can become infected repeatedly.''Some ''babies'' are born with an indentation just above the crease of the buttocks called a sacral dimple. If the sacral dimple becomes infected, it can become a pilonidal cyst.' "
What are risk factors for a pilonidal cyst?,'Risk factors for pilonidal cysts include the following:' Male predominance (four times more often than in women) Young age (most commonly found in men in their 20s) Sedentary lifestyle Thick body hair Family history Local shaving or damage to the skin from friction Overweight or obese Previous pilonidal cyst

How do doctors diagnose a pilonidal cyst?,"'A doctor will diagnose a pilonidal cyst by first doing a physical examination. A pilonidal cyst looks like a lump, swelling, or abscess at the cleft of the buttock with tenderness, and possibly a draining or bleeding area (sinus). The location of the cyst at the top of the buttocks makes it characteristic for a pilonidal cyst.''If infection is severe, blood tests may be performed for diagnosis. There is usually no need for imaging tests in cases of pilonidal cysts.' "
Are there any home remedies for a pilonidal cyst?,"'Home remedies are aimed at relieving pain and swelling. These home treatments include the following:''It has been suggested that raw ''garlic'' applied directly to the cyst may help with infection, however, it can be extremely irritating to the skin and the ''open wound'"". Talk to your doctor before using any herbal supplement or natural remedy as some may interact with medications you are on. In addition, if your cyst has been drained and is open, you need to follow your doctor's instructions."" Sitz baths: Sitting in a tub of warm water up to the hips can relieve pain and may reduce the chances the cyst will worsen. Vitamin C and zinc supplements can help in the healing process. Vitamin A also helps with tissue repair. Consult a doctor for the right dose of these supplements. Essential oils, such as tea tree oil and sage oil, may help soothe the cyst and may even help fight infection. A product called No Bump Rx helps prevent ingrown hairs. Castor oil applied to the cyst may help reduce inflammation. A coccyx cushion or pillow can provide support and comfort while sitting. Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which can aid in healing."
What is the treatment for a pilonidal cyst? Is surgery necessary for pilonidal cysts?,"'Treatment for pilonidal cysts involves draining the infection (abscess), usually by lancing open the ''wound''. A procedure called an ""incision and drainage"" (I&D) is performed either using local anesthesia or general anesthesia; an I&D drains pus and debris from inside the cyst ''cavity''. Pit picking is a non-excision procedure that involves a lateral (side to side) incision that drains the cyst, and the midline pits leading under the skin are removed.''If extensive ''scar'' tissue or chronic sinus tract is found in the pilonidal cyst area, a more extensive excision surgery may be needed for removal of the abscess. A pilonidal cystectomy removes the cysts or tracts that extend from the sinus. The wound may be left open with gauze packing or sutured shut. A cleft lift/modified Karydakis procedure only removes scarred skin, and not deeper tissue, and the incision is more to the side for improved healing. Other types of surgeries for pilonidal cyst include flap procedures such as the Limberg flap, Z-plasty, and rotational flap, which remove larger amounts of tissue. They are usually not a first line of surgical treatment.''If there is a severe infection (''cellulitis'' or ''sepsis''), or if a patient is immune-suppressed (patients with ''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', on steroid treatment, or other immune-modulating medications), antibiotics are usually prescribed and hospitalization may be necessary.''Recovery time for pilonidal cyst surgery varies depending on whether you are left with an open or closed wound. If you have an open wound (tissue is removed, leaving a ''cavity'', and the body heals from the inside out) it can take eight weeks for it to heal into a patch of scar tissue. If you have a closed wound (sutured by the doctor), healing is much faster, however, there is a greater chance for reinfection which can delay healing. Recovery time for the cleft lift/modified Karydakis procedure is about four weeks. In general, inflammation will last up to six days, and growth of new tissue continues for about two months.''The only time nonsurgical treatment for a pilonidal cyst is considered is if the cyst is minor and symptoms are mild and infrequent. Prevent the cyst from getting worse by using good hygiene, exfoliating the area, sitting with good posture, and using a coccyx cushion.'

What types of doctors treat pilonidal cysts?,"""A primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, internist, or pediatrician, may diagnose a pilonidal cyst. A dermatologist may also be seen because many patients believe it's a skin-related problem. You may also see an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist in a hospital emergency department.''If the cyst needs to be drained, a primary care physician, emergency medicine physician, a general surgeon, or ''colorectal'' surgeon may perform the procedure.' "
What is the prognosis of a pilonidal cyst?,"'The prognosis for a pilonidal cyst is generally good, and often the cyst can be cured with surgery. Unfortunately, reoccurrence of abscesses is frequent if extensive scar tissue or sinus formation occurs. Surgical treatment can be curative although, even with surgery, a small amount of cysts may reoccur. Complications include infection or scarring to the area.' "
Is it possible to prevent a pilonidal cyst?,"'In people prone to, or with risk factors for pilonidal cysts, modifying risk factors may help prevent flare-ups. ''Prevention'' of pilonidal cysts involves proper hygiene. Keeping the area clean and hair-free and exfoliating are the first steps. Losing weight and avoiding clothing that chafes the coccyx area helps prevent inflammation or infection. Prevention also entails proper sitting posture that can aggravate the tailbone area, and use of a coccyx cushion to keep pressure off the tailbone (a ''hemorrhoid'' ""donut"" pillow is not adequate for pilonidal cyst patients).'

They are usually not a first line of surgical treatment.''If there is a severe infection (''cellulitis'' or ''sepsis''), or if a patient is immune-suppressed (patients with ''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', on steroid treatment, or other immune-modulating medications), antibiotics are usually prescribed and hospitalization may be necessary.''Recovery time for pilonidal cyst surgery varies depending on whether you are left with an open or closed wound. If you have an open wound (tissue is removed, leaving a ''cavity'', and the body heals from the inside out) it can take eight weeks for it to heal into a patch of scar tissue. If you have a closed wound (sutured by the doctor), healing is much faster, however, there is a greater chance for reinfection which can delay healing. Recovery time for the cleft lift/modified Karydakis procedure is about four weeks. In general, inflammation will last up to six days, and growth of new tissue continues for about two months.''The only time nonsurgical treatment for a pilonidal cyst is considered is if the cyst is minor and symptoms are mild and infrequent. Prevent the cyst from getting worse by using good hygiene, exfoliating the area, sitting with good posture, and using a coccyx cushion.'

What types of doctors treat pilonidal cysts?,"""A primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, internist, or pediatrician, may diagnose a pilonidal cyst. A dermatologist may also be seen because many patients believe it's a skin-related problem. You may also see an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist in a hospital emergency department.''If the cyst needs to be drained, a primary care physician, emergency medicine physician, a general surgeon, or ''colorectal'' surgeon may perform the procedure.' "
What is the prognosis of a pilonidal cyst?,"'The prognosis for a pilonidal cyst is generally good, and often the cyst can be cured with surgery. Unfortunately, reoccurrence of abscesses is frequent if extensive scar tissue or sinus formation occurs. Surgical treatment can be curative although, even with surgery, a small amount of cysts may reoccur. Complications include infection or scarring to the area.' "
Is it possible to prevent a pilonidal cyst?,"'In people prone to, or with risk factors for pilonidal cysts, modifying risk factors may help prevent flare-ups. ''Prevention'' of pilonidal cysts involves proper hygiene. Keeping the area clean and hair-free and exfoliating are the first steps. Losing weight and avoiding clothing that chafes the coccyx area helps prevent inflammation or infection. Prevention also entails proper sitting posture that can aggravate the tailbone area, and use of a coccyx cushion to keep pressure off the tailbone (a ''hemorrhoid'' ""donut"" pillow is not adequate for pilonidal cyst patients).'  "
What is a pimple? What does it look like (pictures)?,"'A ''pimple'' is usually a small, firm inflamed spot on the skin and has many other names such as zit, bleb, ''boil'', carbuncle, and others. Some pimples may become large. A ''pimple'' is an inflamed area of skin with pus formation in the center, resulting from a bacterial infection of the oil gland that produces sebum.''A picture of a pimple is shown above.' "
What is a cold sore? What does it look like (pictures),"'A ''cold sore'' is an inflamed ''blister'' (also termed a ''fever'' ''blister'' or oral ''herpes'') on the lips and/or near the mouth, caused by infection with herpes simplex ''viruses'' (HSV-1 and HSV-2).' "
What are similarities and differences between pimples and cold sores?,"'Similarities between pimples and cold sores include that they both can heal without treatment, both have stages of development, both usually appear on the face, and both may cause embarrassment and/or social stigma.''The following table highlights differences between pimples and cold sores:' "
What are causes and risk factors for pimples and cold sores?,"'Cold sores are caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses, with the majority of facial cold sores caused by HSV-1 (about 80%). Risk factors include person-to-person transmission by direct skin contact, sharing eating utensils and other personal items (such as razors or towels), and even kissing can transmit viruses through saliva. It is also possible to transmit the disease with oral sex.''Pimples are caused by inflammation and bacterial overgrowth in the sebaceous glands of the skin. They are not caused by person-to-person contact. Risk factors include clogged sebaceous glands (''whitehead'' and/or ''blackhead'' formation that indicates clogging of sebaceous glands), hormonal changes (especially in individuals undergoing ''puberty''), and/or chemical irritants placed on the skin. Breakouts of pimples sometimes occur due to hormonal changes, for example during ''menstruation''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of pimples and cold sores?,"'The signs and symptoms of pimples and cold sores can be summarized by the five stages by which both pimples and cold sores develop.''The following are the signs and symptoms of ''pimples'':''The following are the signs and symptoms of ''cold sores'':''The process for pimple formation and healing often occurs over a longer time span than the process with cold sores (two to four weeks). The longer time span is due to the time it takes to form whiteheads and/or ''blackheads''. Additionally, it takes about a month after pus develops and drains for the inflammation to decrease and have the skin heal. In some individuals who have pimples with large areas of pus, the skin may form a ''scar''.'   No visible lesions; possible tingling Reddish, flat small area of skin Possible whitehead or blackhead development Pus develops that eventually spontaneously drains Inflammation decreases and skin heals No visible lesions; possible tingling Fluid-filled blisters begin to appear Blisters ooze clear fluid and form painful sores Sores dry and form scabs Scabs fall off skin and skin heals"
What tests do doctors use to diagnose pimples and cold sores?,"'Your primary health ''caregiver'"", for most individuals, does not require tests to diagnose pimples and/or cold sores. These two problems are almost always diagnosed with the patient's history and physical exam. Patients with severe infections may be referred to a dermatologist and/or an infectious disease specialist who may order specialized tests."" "
What are treatments and medications for pimples and cold sores?,"'The treatments and medications for pimples and cold sores are different.''The most common treatment for pimples is an ''over-the-counter'' medication that comes in lotions, gels, cleansers, creams, and skin washes; it is ''benzoyl peroxide''. It can kill bacteria and also remove some of the oil and dead skin cells associated with whiteheads and ''blackheads''. Another common treatment is salicylic acid, which helps to open pores. Individuals with severe pimple formation may require antibiotics (for example, ''minocycline'' [''Minocin''] and ''doxycycline'' [''Oracea'', Monodox, Vibra-Tabs]) and consultation with a dermatologist. Do not pick at or pop pimples. This can make the infection worse and result in scar formation.''Alternative medicine for pimples includes lemon juice, ''tea tree oil'', ''green tea'', honey, mint, ''echinacea'', and many others. For alternative medicine treatments, you should discuss them with your primary care physician before use.''Treatment for cold sores does not cure the disease, but it may speed up the healing process. There are many antiviral ''drugs'' that are used to treat cold sores. These antivirals may be administered as pills, creams, and more severe infections, even injected. Some of the ''drugs'' used for treatment of cold sores are as follows:''Alternative medicine treatments for cold sores include lysine as an oral supplement or cream, sage plus rhubarb in a cream, propolis (synthetic beeswax), and ''stress'' reduction.'  Acyclovir (Xerese, Zovirax) Docosanol (Abreva) Famciclovir (Famvir) Penciclovir (Denavir) Valacyclovir (Valtrex)"
What is the prognosis of pimples and cold sores?,"'The prognosis for pimples and/or cold sores is usually good. For many individuals, pimples and cold sores may require little or no treatment and have few or no complications, so the prognosis is good. However, in patients with severe pimple formation or frequent outbreaks of cold sores, the prognosis is somewhat less (good to fair). These individuals may require relatively frequent treatments and may have many recurrences even with appropriate treatments.' "
Is it possible to prevent pimples and cold sores?,"'To reduce the chance of developing pimples, dermatologists suggest that you wash your face twice a day with warm water using a mild cleanser. Do not scrub the skin hard. If you use ''makeup'', it should be removed every day before going to bed. For some individuals (for example, teenagers), use of benzoyl peroxide-containing medication with a fairly regular basis may be required to help prevent pimple formation. For those individuals who have severe problems with pimple formation, the use of antibiotics may be warranted.''To reduce the chance of getting cold sores, individuals need to avoid sharing items such as utensils, towels, and other items. Individuals should avoid person-to-person contact (for example, kissing or other physical contact) to reduce and/or prevent the transfer of the viruses that cause cold sores. In addition, people with cold sores can help stop the spread by avoiding touching the ''cold sore'' and/or by washing their hands frequently.' "
What is acne?,"'Acne'' (''acne vulgaris'', common ''acne'') is a disease of the hair follicles of the face, chest, and back that affects almost all teenagers during ''puberty'' -- the only exception being members of a few primitive Neolithic tribes living in isolation. It is not caused by bacteria, although bacteria play a role in its development. It is not unusual for some women to develop ''acne'' in their mid- to late-20s.''Acne vulgaris is typical teenage acne which is characterized by three types of lesions:''Acne appears on the skin as''One can do a lot to treat acne using products available at a drugstore or cosmetic counter that does not require a prescription. However, for tougher cases of acne, one should consult a physician for treatment options.'   the comedo or blackhead; the inflammatory papule; and the pustule or pimple. occluded pores (""comedones""), also known as blackheads or whiteheads, tender red bumps also are known as pimples or zits, pustules (bumps containing pus), and occasionally as cysts (the deep pimples and boils of cystic acne)."
What causes acne?,"'No one factor causes acne. Acne occurs when sebaceous (oil) glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Sebum (oil) is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Associated with increased oil production is a change in the manner in which the skin cells mature, predisposing them to plug the follicular pore. The plug can appear as a ''whitehead'' if it is covered by a thin layer of skin, or if exposed to the air, the darker exposed portion of the plug is called a ""blackhead."" The plugged ''hair follicle'"" gradually enlarges, producing a bump. As the follicle enlarges, the wall may rupture, allowing irritating substances and normal skin bacteria access into the deeper layers of the skin, ultimately producing inflammation. Inflammation near the skin's surface produces a pustule; deeper inflammation results in a papule (pimple); if the inflammation is deeper still, it forms a ""'cyst''.'""Here are some factors that don't usually play a role in acne:""'In occasional patients, the following may be contributing factors:'   Food: Parents often tell teens to avoid pizza, greasy and fried foods, and junk food. While these foods may not be good for overall health, they don't play an important causal role in acne. Although some recent studies have implicated a high-carbohydrate diet, milk, and pure chocolate in aggravating acne, these findings are far from established. Dirt: Blackheads are oxidized oil, not dirt. Sweat does not cause acne and is produced by entirely separate glands in the skin. On the other hand, excessive washing can dry and irritate the skin. Stress: Some people get so upset by their pimples that they pick at them and make them last longer. Stress, however, does not play much of a direct role in causing acne. Heredity: If one of your parents had severe acne, it is likely that your acne will be more difficult to control. Pressure: In some patients, pressure from helmets, chin straps, collars, suspenders, and the like can aggravate acne. Drugs: Some medications may cause or worsen acne, such as those containing iodides, bromides, or oral or injected steroids (either the medically prescribed prednisone [Deltasone, Orasone, Prednicen-M, Liquid Pred] or the steroids that bodybuilders or athletes sometimes take). Other drugs that can cause or aggravate acne are anticonvulsant medications and lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid). Most cases of acne, however, are not drug-related. Occupations: In some jobs, exposure to industrial products like cutting oils may produce acne. Cosmetics: Some cosmetics and skincare products are pore-clogging (""comedogenic""). Of the many available brands of skincare products, it is important to read the list of ingredients and choose those which have water listed first or second if one is concerned about acne. These ""water-based"" products are usually best for those with acne."
What other skin conditions can mimic acne symptoms and signs?,"   Rosacea: This condition is characterized by pimples but not comedones and occurs in the middle third of the face, along with redness, flushing, and superficial blood vessels. It generally affects people in their 30s and 40s and older. Pseudofolliculitis: This is sometimes called ""razor bumps"" or ""razor rash."" When cut too close to the skin, growing hairs twist into the skin and produce tender bumps. This is a mechanical problem, and treatment involves shaving less (growing a beard, laser hair removal). Pseudofolliculitis can, of course, occur in patients who have acne, too. Folliculitis: Pimples can occur on other parts of the body, such as the abdomen, buttocks, or legs. These represent not acne but inflamed follicles. If these don't go away on their own, doctors can prescribe oral or external antibiotics, generally not the same ones used for acne. Gram-negative folliculitis: Some patients who have been treated with oral antibiotics for long periods of time develop pustules filled with bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics that were previously used. Bacterial culture tests can identify these germs, leading the doctor to prescribe different antibiotics or other forms of treatment."
When should someone start acne treatment?,"""Since everyone gets acne at some time, the right time to treat it is when it becomes bothersome or when the potential for scarring develops. This can be when severe acne flares suddenly, for mild acne that just won't go away, or even when a single pimple decides to show up the week before one's prom or wedding.""  "
How to get rid of acne (pimples),"'Moderation and regularity are good things, but not everyone can ''sleep'' eight hours, eat three healthy meals per day, and drink plenty of water a day. Probably the most useful lifestyle changes one can make is to ''never'' to pick or squeeze pimples. Playing with or popping pimples, no matter how careful and clean one is, nearly always makes bumps stay redder and bumpier longer. People often refer to redness as ""scarring,"" but fortunately, it usually isn\'t permanent. It\'s just a mark that takes months to fade if left entirely alone.''Occasional visits to an esthetician who is an expert at safely removing blackheads during a facial can be beneficial.''Despite what one might read in popular style and fashion magazines, there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and situation.''Benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of people, which goes away as soon as one stops using the product. Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach, so do not let products containing benzoyl peroxide come into contact with fabrics, leaving unsightly white spots on colored clothes, shirts, towels, and carpets.''One cannot stop oil glands from producing oil. Even ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane, see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they resume normal activity later. It is possible to get rid of oil on the surface of the skin and reduce the appearance of shine.'   Mild cleansers: Washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid (for example, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Purpose, and Cetaphil are all inexpensive and popular) will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation. Exfoliating cleansers and masks: A variety of mild scrubs, exfoliants, and masks can be used. These products may contain salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a very mild peeling agent. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores. Products containing glycolic or alpha hydroxy acids are also gentle skin exfoliants. Retinol: Not to be confused with the prescription medication Retin-A, this derivative of vitamin A can help promote skin peeling. Antibacterial cleansers: The most popular ingredient in over-the-counter antibacterial cleansers is benzoyl peroxide. Topical (external) applications: Antibacterial cleansers come in the form of gels, creams, and lotions that are applied to the affected area. The active ingredients that kill surface bacteria include benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, and resorcinol. Some brands promoted on the Internet and cable TV (such as ProActiv) are much more costly than identical and sometimes more potent products one can buy in the drugstore. Use a gentle astringent/toner to wipe away oil. (There are many brands available in pharmacies, as well as from manufacturers of cosmetic lines.) Products containing glycolic acid or one of the other alpha hydroxy acids are also helpful in clearing the skin by causing the superficial layer of the skin to peel (exfoliate). Masks containing sulfur and other ingredients draw out facial oil. Antibacterial pads containing benzoyl peroxide have the additional benefit of helping to wipe away oil."
How does a doctor treat acne?,"""It's best to consult a primary care physician or dermatologist if an individual is unable to adequately control his or her acne. The goal of treatment should be the ""'prevention'' of scarring (not a flawless complexion) so that after the condition spontaneously resolves there is no lasting sign of the affliction. Here are some of the options available:'   Topical (externally applied) antibiotics and antibacterials: These include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Eryc, Ery-Tab, PCE, Pediazole, Ilosone), clindamycin (BenzaClin, Duac), sulfacetamide (Klaron), azelaic acid (Azelex or Finacea), and dapsone (Aczone). Retinoids: Retin-A (tretinoin) has been in use for years, and preparations have become milder and gentler while still maintaining its effectiveness. Newer retinoids include adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac). These medications are especially helpful for unclogging pores. Side effects may include irritation and a mild increase in sensitivity to the sun. Adapalene 0.1% is now available without a prescription. With proper sun protection, however, they can be used even during sunny periods. The combination medication is known as Epiduo gel -- which contains the retinoid, adapalene, along with the antibacterial, benzoyl peroxide -- is applied once a day. Oral medications: Doctors may start antibiotic treatment with tetracycline (Sumycin) or one of the related ""cyclines,"" such as doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox, and others) and minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin). Other oral antibiotics that are useful for treating acne are cefadroxil (Duricef), amoxicillin (Amoxil, DisperMox, Trimox), and sulfa drugs.Problems with these drugs can include allergic reactions (especially sulfa), gastrointestinal upset, and increased sun sensitivity. Doxycycline, in particular, is generally safe but can sometime cause esophagitis (irritation of the esophagus, producing discomfort when swallowing) and an increased tendency to sunburn.Despite the concern that the long-term use of tetracycline antibiotics for acne might ""weaken the immune system"" or induce bacterial resistance, these concerns seem to be unwarranted.Oral contraceptives: Oral contraceptives (birth control pills), which are low in estrogen to promote safety, have little effect on acne one way or the other. Some contraceptive pills have been shown to have modest effectiveness in treating acne. Those that have been U.S. FDA approved for treating acne are Estrostep, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, and Yaz. Most dermatologists work together with primary care physicians or gynecologists when recommending these medications.Spironolactone (Aldactone): This drug blocks androgen (hormone) receptors. It can cause breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities, and increased potassium levels in the bloodstream. It can help some women with resistant acne, however, and is generally well-tolerated in the young women who need it.Cortisone injections: To make large pimples and cysts flatten out fast, doctors inject them with a form of cortisone.Isotretinoin: Accutane was the original brand name; there are now several generic versions in common use, including Sotret, Claravis, and Amnesteem. Isotretinoin is an excellent treatment for severe, scarring, persistent acne and has been used on millions of patients since it was introduced in Europe in 1971 and the U.S. in 1982. It should be used for people with severe acne, chiefly of the cystic variety, that has been unresponsive to conventional therapies like those listed above. If taken in sufficient dosage, it should eliminate the need to continue the use of prescription drugs in most patients. The drug has many potential serious side effects and requires several unique controls before it is prescribed. This means that isotretinoin is not a good choice for people whose acne is not that severe but who are frustrated and want ""something that will knock acne out once and for all."" To use the drug, the prescribing physician, the patient, and the supplying pharmacy must be enrolled in the online ""iPLEDGE PROGRAM."" Used properly, isotretinoin is safe and produces few side effects beyond dry lips and occasional muscle aches. This drug is prescribed for five to six months at a dosage that has a high likelihood of preventing the return of acne. Fasting blood tests are monitored monthly to check liver function and the level of triglycerides, substances related to cholesterol, which often rise a bit during treatment but rarely to the point at which treatment has to be modified or stopped.Even though isotretinoin does not remain in the body after therapy is stopped, improvement is often long-lasting. It is safe to take two or three courses of the drug if unresponsive acne makes a comeback. It is, however, best to wait at least several months and to try other methods before using isotretinoin again.Isotretinoin has a high risk of inducing birth defects if taken by pregnant women. Women of childbearing age who take isotretinoin need two negative pregnancy tests (blood or urine) before starting the drug, monthly tests while they take it, and another after they are done. Those who are sexually active must use two forms of contraception, one of which is usually the oral contraceptive pill. Isotretinoin leaves the body completely when treatment is done; women must be sure to avoid pregnancy for one month after therapy is stopped. There is, however, no risk of childbearing after that time.Other concerns include inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of depression and suicide in patients taking isotretinoin. Recent evidence seems to indicate that these problems are exceedingly rare. Government oversight has resulted in a highly publicized and very burdensome national registration system for those taking the drug. This has reinforced concerns in many patients and their families have that isotretinoin is dangerous. Large-scale studies so far have shown no convincing evidence of increased risk for those taking isotretinoin compared with the general population. It is important for those taking this drug to report changes in mood or bowel habits (or any other symptoms) to their doctors. Even patients who are being treated for depression are not barred from taking isotretinoin, whose striking success often improves the mood and outlook of patients with severe disease. Problems with these drugs can include allergic reactions (especially sulfa), gastrointestinal upset, and increased sun sensitivity. Doxycycline, in particular, is generally safe but can sometime cause esophagitis (irritation of the esophagus, producing discomfort when swallowing) and an increased tendency to sunburn.

Light treatments: Recent years have brought reports of success in treating acne using special lights and similar devices, alone or in conjunction with photosensitizing dyes. It appears that these treatments are safe and can be effective, but it is not clear that their success is lasting. At this point, laser treatment of acne is best thought of as an adjunct to conventional therapy, rather than as a substitute. Chemical peels: Whether the superficial peels (like glycolic acid) performed by estheticians or deeper ones performed in the doctor's office, chemical peels are of modest, supportive benefit only, and in general, they do not substitute for regular therapy. Treatment of acne scars: For those patients whose acne has gone away but left them with permanent scarring, several options are available. These include surgical procedures to elevate deep, depressed acne scars and laser resurfacing to smooth out shallow acne scars. Newer forms of laser resurfacing (""fractional resurfacing"") are less invasive and heal faster than older methods, although results are less complete and the procedures may need to be repeated three or more times. These treatments can help, but they are never completely successful at eliminating acne scars."
Are there any home remedies for acne?,"   Cosmetics: Don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted cover-ups or even foundation, as long as it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). There are many quality products available. Facials: While not absolutely essential, steaming and ""deep-cleaning"" pores are useful, both alone and in addition to medical treatment, especially for people with ""whiteheads"" or ""blackheads."" Having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it oneself. Pore strips: Pharmacies now carry, under a variety of brand names, strips which one applies to the nose, forehead, chin, etc., to ""pull out"" oil from pores. These are, in effect, a do-it-yourself facial. They are inexpensive, safe, and work reasonably well if used properly. Toothpaste: One popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. There is no medical basis for this. The same applies to vinegar."
What is the best skin care routine for acne?,"'These are all good basic skin regimens that may help with the acne battle:'   Cleanse gently twice daily. Apply a gel or cream containing 5% benzoyl peroxide; an alternative is sulfur or resorcinol. Use a pad containing 2% salicylic acid to help exfoliation each morning. At night, apply a spot cream containing sulfur to the affected areas. Use a light skin moisturizer and water-based makeup."
How would you summarize current-day acne treatment?,"'Treating acne requires patience and perseverance. Any of the treatments listed above may take two or three months to start working (even isotretinoin). Unless there are side effects such as excessive dryness or ''allergy'', it is important to give each regimen or drug enough time to work before giving up on it and moving on to other methods. Using modern methods, doctors can help clear up the skin of just about everyone.'""Just hang in there. And don't pick. Please.""  "
What is a pinched nerve?,"'A ""pinched nerve"" is the name given to the uncomfortable sensation, ''pain'', or numbness caused when increased pressure leads to irritation or damage to a peripheral nerve. (A peripheral nerve is one that is outside the brain and spinal cord.) Although this condition is often associated with ''back pain'' or a ''neck injury'', almost any nerve is susceptible.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a pinched nerve?,"'The most common pinched nerve symptom is a tingling sensation, which can be accompanied by some numbness. This may initially come and go, but over time becomes persistent. ''Pain'' may accompany the tingling sensation and is often described as being ""sharp"" or ""electrical."" Some patients experience a burning sensation in the affected area.''In severe cases, muscle ''weakness'' may occur because the nerve that controls the muscle has been irritated. If present and not identified and corrected, those muscles may decrease in size and function.''Common areas where nerves are pinched include the following:''Of note, although ''tennis elbow'' is a painful condition often associated with repetitive activities, the pain is caused by inflammation of the tendons of the elbow, not a pinched nerve.'   carpal tunnel (where the median nerve at the wrist is injured) ulnar nerve at the elbow (frequently caused by leaning on elbows while sitting or driving) lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (This is also known as meralgia paresthetica, caused by compression of the sensory nerve leading to the upper thigh. This may also be seen in pregnancy, when the enlarging uterus can also cause nerve compression.) common peroneal nerve injury (associated with crossing the legs at the knee) sciatic nerve problems or sciatica, pain which travels from the low back into the leg (This is frequently used to label the symptoms associated with a pinched nerve in the low back or lumbar spine. Patients with this condition describe pain which travels from the back into a leg or hip.) cervical spine (A pinched nerve in the neck can cause pain or tingling in the spine to travel into the arm or shoulder blade region.)"
What causes a pinched nerve?,"'Pressure on a peripheral nerve can irritate the nerve itself, its protective covering (myelin sheath), or both. When this occurs, the nerve is unable to conduct sensory impulses to the brain appropriately, leading to a sense of numbness. This inflammation associated with the damage or injury can also cause pain or paresthesia (a tingling or prickling sensation) signals to be sent to the brain. In its early stages, many people may describe this sensation as a body part that has ""fallen asleep."" However, if nerve inflammation persists, this sensation persists rather than resolving after a few minutes.''If the nerve is compressed for a short amount of time, it is often able to repair itself but it may take several weeks or months for the symptoms to fully resolve. However, if the compression remains present for a long time, permanent nerve injury may occur.'  "
What are the risk factors for a pinched nerve?,"'Anything which increases pressure around a nerve can cause a pinched nerve. Common causes include body position such as leaning on elbows, habitually crossing legs, or poor posture. Over time this may lead to pressure injury to nerves in these regions.' Disc herniation or bulging discs and arthritis in the spine can cause pressure on nerve roots which leads to the nerve pain or discomfort associated with a pinched nerve. Weight gain or water retention can predispose people to developing pinched nerves; thyroid disease (especially hypothyroidism, or low thyroid hormone levels) can contribute to both water retention and weight gain and can increase the risk of certain types of pinched nerves. Pregnancy, which is associated with increased weight and occasionally associated with water retention, is also a common risk factor for developing certain types of pinched nerves. Repetitive activities (typing and using certain tools) can also increase swelling around specific nerves and lead to symptoms of a pinched nerve."
What tests diagnose a pinched nerve?,"'The health care professional often makes the diagnosis of pinched nerve by taking a history of symptoms and performing a careful physical examination. Depending on the findings, the diagnosis may be made clinically or further testing may be required.''Electromyography (''EMG'') is a nerve conduction study to help confirm the diagnosis of a pinched nerve and to determine the extent of nerve damage.''If the pinched nerve is in the neck (cervical spine) or back (lumbar spine), an ''MRI'' or ''CT scan'' may be considered to make the diagnosis and look for the cause (''herniated disc'', arthritis, or ''fracture'').'  "
What are pinched nerve treatment options and home remedies?,"'The treatment of a pinched nerve depends upon the location and the cause. Resting the affected area is often very effective, especially in cases of injury caused by repetitive activities. Physical therapy is frequently beneficial when a pinched ''spinal nerve'' is caused by problems in the neck or low back. Exercises may strengthen the back or core muscles and decrease or eliminate pressure on a nerve root. ''Over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like ''ibuprofen'' and ''naproxen'' may be helpful. Injections of ''corticosteroids'' (an anti-inflammatory medication) may also be beneficial for many types of pinched nerves.''For cases of ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', splinting or bracing the wrist is often used. In cases of ulnar neuropathy or common peroneal neuropathy, learning to change body positions may be required to achieve the best outcome.''Weight loss'' can be of benefit for many types of pinched nerves.''Surgery may be required to release pressure on the nerve if it fails to respond to medication, splinting, physical therapy, or injections. The specific type of surgery depends upon the nerve involved. However, the goal of the surgery is the same, to eliminate or relieve the pressure on the affected nerve.'  "
Can a pinched nerve go away without treatment? Can nerve damage be permanent?,"""In many cases, once a pinched nerve has been identified, the symptoms can be resolved when treatment allows the nerve to recover. There are instances where the nerve damage is permanent, and a patient may be left with permanent numbness or pain in the affected area. Many patients fall in between. Because nerves can regenerate (regrow) very slowly over time, it's important to seek evaluation for symptoms which persist or recur over a number of days or weeks."" "
Can you prevent a pinched nerve?,"'Paying attention to body positions (maintaining good posture, not leaning on elbows, reducing the frequency of leg crossing) and decreasing repetitive activities can help prevent a pinched nerve. Using ergonomic principles at work and at home can decrease the risk of nerve injuries. If repetitive activities are necessary to perform a task, incorporating frequent breaks or rest periods can reduce or eliminate the risk of nerve injury.' "
What is pinkeye (conjunctivitis)?,"'Pinkeye, or ''conjunctivitis'', is inflammation of the membranes (''conjunctiva'') covering the white parts of the eyes and the membranes on the inner part of the eyelids. These membranes react to a wide range of bacteria, ''viruses'', ''allergy''-provoking agents, irritants, and toxic agents, as well as to underlying diseases within the body.' Viral and bacterial forms of conjunctivitis are common in childhood, but they occur in adults as well. Pinkeye can occur in people of any age. Overall, however, there are many causes of pinkeye. These can be classified as either infectious or noninfectious. Pinkeye does not cause any changes in vision."
"Viral Pinkeye Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","'The leading cause of a red, inflamed eye is viral infection. ''Adenoviruses'' are the type of virus that is most commonly responsible for the infection. Other viruses that can cause pinkeye include''Viral ''pinkeye symptoms'' are usually associated with more of a watery discharge from the eye that is not green or yellow in color. The discharge may resemble an increase in tears or ''watery eyes''. Viral pinkeye is most common in late fall and early spring. Often, viral ""''cold-like''"" symptoms, such as sinus ''congestion'' and ''runny nose'', are also present. The eyelids may be swollen or puffy and the inner eyelids reddened. Sometimes looking at bright lights is painful so that the individual experiences ''sensitivity to light''.''While viral pinkeye may not require an antibiotic, those affected should see a doctor, as occasionally this form of pinkeye can be associated with infection of the ''cornea'' (the clear portion of the front of the eyeball).''This infection must be correctly detected and treated. Viral pinkeye is highly contagious and typically remains contagious for 10 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. The symptoms of viral pinkeye can last one to two weeks. Symptoms are pronounced for the first three to five days after symptoms appear, with slow resolution over the following one to two weeks.'   herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum, vaccinia), picornavirus (enterovirus 70, Coxsackie A24), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
Bacterial Pinkeye,"'Staphylococci'' and ''Streptococci'' are types of bacteria that commonly cause pinkeye. Gonococci and ''chlamydia'' may also cause bacterial pinkeye. ''Symptoms of pinkeye'' caused by bacteria occur rapidly and can include''The discharge commonly accumulates after sleeping. Affected children may awaken with crusty eyelashes most unhappy that their ""eyes are stuck shut,"" requiring a warm washcloth applied to the eyes to remove the discharge. ''Bacterial conjunctivitis'"" is treated by repeated warm washcloths applied to the eyes (try applying these to a child's eye one eye at a time during a favorite video) and requires antibiotic eyedrops or ointment prescribed by the doctor.""'Be careful not to use medication prescribed for someone else, or from an old infection, as these may be inappropriate for the current infection or may have been contaminated from other infections by accidentally touching the medicine bottle to infected areas. A safe, effective, and potentially less frightening method of putting drops into the eyes of children involves asking the child to lie down flat, with instructions to merely ""close your eyes,"" and placing the recommended number of drops in the inner corner of the eye, next to the ''bridge'' of the nose, and letting them make a little ""lake"" there. When the child relaxes and opens the eyes, the medicine will flow gently into the infected mucous membranes without the need to ""force open"" the eyes.''When someone thinks he (or she) has bacterial conjunctivitis (bacterial pinkeye), it is very important to see a doctor immediately for several reasons.' eye pain or burning, swelling, itching, redness, a moderate to large amount of oozing or eye discharge, usually thick and yellow or greenish in color, swelling of the lymph nodes in front of the ears. First, if the cause is a bacterial infection, an antibiotic will be needed to help the infection-fighting immune system to kill this infection. Types of topical ophthalmic (eye drops) antibiotics often used for pinkeye include besifloxacin (Besivance), gatifloxacin (Zymaxid), levofloxacin (Levaquin, Quixin, Iquix), moxifloxacin (Moxeza, Vigamox), tobramycin (Tobrex), ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan), erythromycin (Ilotycin), and others. Secondly, if someone is experiencing other symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, earache, etc., there is a good chance that these symptoms are caused by the same bacteria, and an oral antibiotic may also be needed to treat this infection along with the antibiotic eye drops or ointment for the eyes.Oral antibiotics are also required for some types of bacterial pinkeye.Finally, a doctor will want to exclude the possibility that the infection has spread to areas where the symptoms may not yet be recognizable. Oral antibiotics are also required for some types of bacterial pinkeye. Finally, a doctor will want to exclude the possibility that the infection has spread to areas where the symptoms may not yet be recognizable."
Chlamydia Pinkeye,"'Pinkeye due to infection with ''chlamydia'' is an uncommon form of bacterial pinkeye in the U.S., but it is very common in Africa and Middle Eastern countries.''Chlamydia'' can cause pinkeye in adults and ''babies''. It is a cause of pinkeye in adolescents and adults that can be sexually transmitted.''Chlamydia pinkeye is typically treated with erythromycin (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone) or oral ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin), except in children less than 8 years of age, because of possible discoloration of the ''teeth''.' "
Allergic Pinkeye,"'Allergic'' conjunctivitis symptoms and signs are usually accompanied by intense ''itching'', tearing, and swelling of the eye membranes. Eye ''pain'' is minimal or absent with allergic conjunctivitis.''Frequent causes include seasonal pollens, animal dander, and dust. It is frequently seasonal and accompanied by other typical ''allergy symptoms'' such as''Moist, ''cold'' compresses applied to the eyes and ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''decongestant'' eyedrops can provide relief. Avoiding exposure to the ''allergen'' particle that leads to the ''allergic reaction'' is most helpful. A doctor can prescribe stronger medications if these home remedies are not adequate.' sneezing, itchy nose, or scratchy throat."
Chemical Pinkeye,"'Chemical pinkeye can result when any irritating substance enters the eyes. Common offending irritants are''Prompt, thorough washing of the eyes with very large amounts of water is very important if an irritating substance enters the eye. A doctor or local poison-control center should be contacted at once, even if the irritant or chemical is thought to be safe, as some of the most common household products like bleach and furniture polish can be very damaging.' household cleaners, sprays of any kind, smoke, a foreign body in the eye, smog, industrial pollutants."
Other Diseases,"'Bright redness of the whites of the eyes can also occur when the tiny blood vessels covering the whites of the eyes rupture from trauma or changes in pressure within the head (for example, after forceful laughing or ''vomiting'', when diving under water, or even bending upside down). While it is similar, this condition is called ''subconjunctival hemorrhage'', and while it can appear frightening, it is generally harmless.' Persistent pinkeye (conjunctivitis) can be a sign of an underlying illness in the body. Most often these are rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conjunctivitis is also seen in Kawasaki's disease (a rare disease associated with fever in infants and young children) and certain inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This condition is different from the inflammation of the conjunctiva seen with pinkeye. It causes a local area of the white portion of the eye (the sclera) to become brilliantly reddened. It does not typically involve the colored portion of the eye (the iris) and does not affect vision."
What are home remedies for pinkeye?,"""Home treatment for pinkeye should not be a substitute for seeking the advice of a health care professional, and it is important to take all medications as prescribed and to follow a health care professional's instructions for managing the condition. However, there are home remedies to help relieve the symptoms of pinkeye.""   Moist warm compresses applied to the eyes can help relieve symptoms. OTC treatments like artificial tears (eyedrops) can also bring relief. Do not wear contact lenses until the pinkeye has resolved. A health care professional can offer guidance about when it is safe to resume the use of contact lenses. Eye makeup and cosmetic creams should also be avoided in the eye area until the symptoms and signs have resolved."
What kinds of doctors treat pinkeye?,"'Pinkeye is often treated by primary care physicians, including pediatricians and family practitioners. An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may also treat pinkeye. Sometimes people may seek care for pinkeye at an urgent care center and may be treated by a specialist in ''emergency medicine''.' "
What is the prognosis for pinkeye?,"'Most uncomplicated cases of pinkeye heal completely without long-term complications. Pinkeye that is related to underlying diseases may recur over time. Some serious infections of the eye may lead to ''vision loss'' when not treated properly, so it is important to seek care for severe or persistent pinkeye, or pinkeye that is associated with decreased vision.' "
How can someone prevent the spread of pinkeye?,"'Infectious forms of pinkeye are highly contagious and are spread by direct contact with infected people. If someone has infectious pinkeye, avoid touching the eye area and wash the hands frequently, particularly after applying medications to the eye area. Never share towels or handkerchiefs, and throw away tissues after each use. Disinfecting surfaces like countertops, sinks, and doorknobs can also help prevent the spread of infectious pinkeye.'  "
What is pinkeye?,"'Pinkeye'', also termed ''conjunctivitis'', is inflammation of the ''conjunctiva'', the tissue that lines the inside of the ''eyelid'' and the white part of the eyeball.'  Pinkeye is a common problem in both children and adults. When pinkeye develops, the blood vessels become more visible and give a pinkish tinge to the eyelids and the whites of the eyes. The inflammation of pinkeye may be caused by four main sources:bacteria,viruses,allergens, andchemical irritants. bacteria, viruses, allergens, and chemical irritants."
Is pinkeye contagious? What is the incubation period for pinkeye?,"'The answer to the question about pinkeye contagiousness depends upon the source or cause of the ''conjunctival'' irritation. For example, bacterial and viral causes of pinkeye are almost always ''contagious'' and are spread from person to person. However, pinkeye caused by allergens and chemical irritants is not ''contagious'' by person-to-person contact. Pinkeye that is contagious has an incubation period as long as 14 days. However, most doctors do not think that pinkeye becomes contagious to other people until symptoms start to develop. Some bacterial and viral ''strains'' are capable of being transferred from humans to pets (for example, ''dogs'' and cats) and also from infected pets to humans.' "
How will I know when I have pinkeye?,"'Unfortunately, the symptoms and signs of both contagious and noncontagious pinkeye often are so similar it is difficult to tell them apart. The symptoms and signs of both contagious and noncontagious pinkeye may include the following:''Diagnosis by a physician is usually done by physical examination and patient history; seldom are tests run because the only effective treatment is removal of noninfectious irritants and relatively short-term antibiotic therapy if bacterial pinkeye is suspected. In rare severe infections, physicians may utilize ''conjunctival'' scrapings and cultures to identify the infecting organism.''If you are unsure if you or others have contagious pinkeye, act as if it is contagious until you know the cause.' Redness and/or swelling of the eyelids newborn Irritated, itchy, gritty and/or a sensation of burning in the eyes Increased tearing Yellowish or greenish discharge, sometimes with crusting Sensitivity to light (photophobia)"
How do people transmit pinkeye?,"'Noncontagious causes (allergens and/or chemical irritants) of pinkeye do not spread to other individuals. Unfortunately, some chemical irritants and allergens can be spread through the air, but contagious causes of pinkeye are usually not spread through the air.''However, contagious causes such as bacterial and viral infections spread easily from person to person by touching an individual infected with pinkeye and then touching your own eyes or eyelids.' Individuals who share items like makeup or eye shadow can transfer pinkeye from these surfaces to other individuals. Pinkeye in newborns can also be caused by sexually transmitted infections and can be very serious for the newborns. Contagious pinkeye often spreads to both eyes in the infected individual."
How long does viral pinkeye last? What is the contagious period for pinkeye?," The cure for pinkeye depends on the cause; noncontagious causes can be rapidly cured (about 12-24 hours) if the cause is removed from the patient (for example, an allergen or irritating chemical is washed out by tears). If the irritant is not removed, noncontagious pinkeye may last for months. Bacterial causes may linger and require antibiotic drops placed in the eye; in about 24-48 hours after beginning antibiotic treatment, patients become noncontagious, but the symptoms and signs can still last up to a month. Unfortunately, viral pinkeye is only treated symptomatically, and it may take a few days to two weeks before symptoms and signs start to resolve. When symptoms and signs resolve, then you are cured of viral pinkeye. However, it is possible for people to get both repeated infections and/or repeated incidents of allergic or chemical irritation, so all causes of pinkeye can recur."
When should I contact a health care provider about pinkeye?,"'Although most cases of pinkeye are mild and get better on their own, in some circumstances, one may need to contact a health care provider. If you have pinkeye and have one or more of the following problems, you should contact your health care provider immediately:'  Symptoms worsen or do not improve, especially if you are undergoing treatment (for example, utilizing antibiotics). Eye pain increases to moderate or severe levels Pinkeye becomes more red in color Moderate to severe light sensitivity and/or blurry or impaired vision If you have a preexisting eye condition If you have an immune system that is weakened (for example, due to HIV, chemotherapy or cancer) If you're pregnant and suspect you may have a sexually transmitted infection, you should contact your OB/GYN physician urgently to be sure your newborn is not infected."
What are the symptoms of a broken finger? How will I know if it's broken?,"'The main symptoms of a broken finger are pain immediately after the trauma, and sometimes a deformed finger.'   A true fracture usually will be painful, but a broken finger may still have some range of motion and dull pain, and the individual may still be able to move it. Depending on the fracture stability, some fractures may be more painful than others may. Usually within 5-10 minutes, swelling and bruising of the finger will occur and the finger will stiffen. Swelling may affect the adjacent fingers as well. Numbness of the finger may occur either from the trauma of the injury itself, or because swelling compresses the nerves in the fingers. Fractures to the finger tip (distal phalanx) are common from smashing injuries to the fingernail. The symptoms of this type of injury may be swelling and bruising to the finger pad and purple-colored blood underneath the fingernail (subungual hematoma). If the trauma is severe, broken bones may be exposed (called a compound fracture)."
How common are broken fingers?,"'Fingers are easily injured, and broken fingers are some of the most common traumatic injuries seen in an emergency room. Fractures of the finger bones (phalanxes) and the bones in the palm of the hand (metacarpal bones) are the most common fractures, accounting for 10% of all fractures. Because fingers are used for many everyday activities, they are at higher risk than other parts of the body for traumatic injury, including sports injuries, workplace injuries, and other accidents.''Understanding the basic anatomy of the hand and fingers is useful in understanding different types of finger injuries, broken fingers, and how some treatments differ from others.''The hand is divided into three sections: 1) wrist, 2) palm, and 3) fingers.'   The wrist has eight bones, which move together to allow the vast ranges of motion of the wrist. The palm or mid-hand is comprised of the metacarpal bones. The metacarpal bones have muscular attachments and bridge the wrist to the individual fingers. These bones frequently are injured with direct trauma such as a crush injury, or most commonly, a punching injury. The fingers are the most frequently injured part of the hand. Fingers are constructed of ligaments (strong supportive tissue connecting bone to bone), tendons (attachment tissue from muscle to bone), and three phalanxes (bones). There are no muscles in the fingers; and fingers move by the pull of forearm muscles on the tendons. The three bones in each finger are named according to their relationship to the palm of the hand. The first bone, closest to the palm, is the  proximal phalanx; the second bone is the middle phalanx; and the smallest and farthest from the hand is the  distal phalanx. The thumb does not have a middle phalanx. The knuckles are joints formed by the bones of the fingers and are commonly injured or dislocated with trauma to the hand.The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture.The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger.The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury. The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture. The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger. The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury."
What causes broken fingers?,"'Traumatic injury is the main cause of broken fingers. Most commonly, traumatic injury to the finger occurs from playing sports, workplace injuries, falls, or other accidents.' "
When should I see a doctor for a broken finger?," After injury, if pain or swelling limits the motion or use of the fingers, or if the finger becomes numb, seek medical care. If the injury to the finger includes a laceration, crushed tissue, or exposure of bone, the individual should go to an emergency department for immediate medical care. Some fractures of the fingers may be subtle and the pain may be tolerable, so if a person suspects that they may have a finger fracture, seek medical attention."
How do doctors diagnose a broken finger?,"'X-ray is the primary tool used to diagnose a broken finger. The doctor will need an X-ray to evaluate the position of the broken finger bones.''With more complex injuries, the doctor may seek the advice of an orthopedic (bone and joint specialist) or hand surgeon (an orthopedic surgeon or ''plastic surgeon'' with post-residency, fellowship level training in ''hand surgery'').'  "
What is the treatment for a broken finger?,"'Broken fingers should be treated by medical professionals; however, a person can minimize some pain and stabilize the injury on the way to seek medical treatment.''The doctor will assess the stability of the broken finger. The treatment for a broken finger depends on the type of fracture, and the particular bone in the finger that is injured.''If the fracture is stable (not likely to worsen or cause complications with the movement of the finger), treatment may be as simple as buddy taping (splinting one finger to another by taping them together) for about four weeks, followed by an additional two weeks of limiting use of the finger.''If the fracture is unstable, the injured finger will need to be immobilized. A splint may be applied after reduction (re-aligning of the fractured fragments). If this does not maintain enough stability, a surgical procedure may be needed.''A surgeon has many different techniques for surgical immobilization, ranging from pinning the fracture with small wires to procedures with plates and screws.''The patient will most likely leave the hospital in some type of immobilizing splint or dressing. Keep the dressing clean, dry, and elevated. It is best not to use the involved hand until a hand specialist is consulted (about one week after the injury) for another X-ray to evaluate the position of the fracture fragments. If the finger is not aligned correctly, it may affect the healing of the finger and leave a permanent disability.'   To reduce swelling and bruising, apply ice to the injured finger on the way to an emergency department. Do not apply ice directly to the skin; put a towel between the ice and the finger. Make a splint to immobilize the finger. A Popsicle stick or pen may be placed next to the broken finger, and then wrap something around the stick and the finger to hold it in place. Wrap loosely - if the finger is wrapped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured digit. Keep the injured finger elevated. Remove all rings or jewelry from the affected hand before swelling occurs."
What are the complications of a broken finger?,"'After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.'   Joint stiffness is the most common problem encountered after treatment of fractures in the fingers due to scar tissue formation and the long immobilization period. Physical therapy may be prescribed (preferably by a hand therapist) to regain range of motion. Rotation can occur when one of the bones in the finger rotates abnormally during the healing process. This can cause deformity and decreased ability to use the injured finger when grasping. Nonunion is a complication of some fractures when the two ends of the bone do not heal together properly, leaving the fractured area unstable. If the skin is injured or if surgery is necessary to fix the fractured bone, infection may result."
How can a broken finger be prevented?,"'The best medicine for ''prevention'' of finger fractures is safety. Most fingers are broken from machines, self-inflicted trauma (punching something), or sporting injuries. Always use safety equipment when doing activities that may injure the hands. Injuries should be evaluated as soon possible.' "
What are pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is an infection of the large intestine and anal area by a small, white parasite that resembles a ""worm."" The medical name for the parasite is ''Enterobius vermicularis'', but it is commonly termed a pinworm in both the lay and medical literature. These parasites are also termed seatworms or threadworms, and the infections is medically termed enterobiasis, oxyuriasis, or helminthiasis. Pinworms and other helminthic parasitic worms (which, as a group, are termed helminths) feed off of the host animal by adsorbing nutrients from the host animal. Pinworm infections are the most common helminth infection that occurs in the US. Pinworms only infect humans. ''Dogs'', cats, or other animals cannot become infected.'  "
Who gets pinworms?,"'Pinworm is the most common parasitic worm infection in the United States, and the majority of pinworm infections worldwide occur in children, in temperate climates.''The highest rates of pinworm infection occur in school-age children. They are followed by preschoolers. Institutional settings including day care facilities often harbor multiple individuals (adults and children) with pinworm infections. Sometimes, nearly half of the children may be infected in a day care facility.''Pinworm infection often occurs in more than one family member. Adults are less likely to have pinworm infection, except for mothers of infected children. However, adult sexual partners can transfer the eggs to each other. Pinworms also may infect the vagina and urethra.' "
What are the symptoms of pinworms in children and adults?,"'If symptoms are present, they are similar in both children and adults. The signs and symptoms may include one or more of the following:''Less common symptoms include:''Many infected children and adults have few or no symptoms but, if the infection is heavy, the symptoms can be correspondingly more severe.'   Intense (pruritus) around the anus and/or vagina Discomfort in the anal and/or vaginal area Rash or skin irritation around the anus or vagina Insomnia or difficulty sleeping and/or restlessness due to irritation of skin Pinworms often can be seen on the anal skin or in the stools, sometimes detected in the vagina and may produce some vaginal discharge Abdominal pain Secondary bacterial infections from intense skin scratching Infrequent infection of the ureters and/or bladder may cause dysuria or bladder discomfort"
What do pinworms and their eggs look like (pinworm pictures)?,"'The pinworms are white, can be seen with the naked eye (no magnification) and are about the length of a staple (about 8-13 mm for female and 2-5mm for male worms). The eggs that are laid by the female worms are not visible as they are about 55 micrometers in diameter and are translucent (see Figure 1).''The male and female worms live for the most part within the rectum of humans but have a life cycle in humans that involves rectal/oral transmission (see Figure 2).''While an infected person is asleep, female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. This causes ''itching'' and irritation of the surrounding area; children especially will scratch the rectal/anal area, get eggs on their fingers or underneath their fingernails and transport the infective eggs to bedding, toys, other humans, or back to themselves. The eggs hatch into larval forms in the small intestines and then progress to the large intestine where they mature, mate, and progress to the rectal/anal area where females deposit about 10,000-15,000 eggs.' "
How do you get pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is spread person to person. The symptoms of pinworm infection are caused by the female pinworm moving and laying her eggs, and this usually occurs at night. Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become infective (capable of infecting another person). They can survive up to two weeks on nightclothes, bed linen, or other objects. Infection is acquired when these eggs are accidentally swallowed, usually due to inadequate hand washing by the parents and children. However, eggs on bedding or other objects that are touched while the eggs are still viable can cause infection or reinfection of people.' "
Can you get pinworms in the vagina?,"'Yes, pinworms can infect the vagina (about 20% of infected girls). Infrequently, the pinworms can go on to infect the Fallopian tubes and other structures.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat pinworms?,"""The majority of pinworm infected patients can be treated by the patient's primary care or pediatric physician. Rarely, an infectious disease specialist, parasitologist, OB/GYN, ""'gastroenterologist'' or dermatologist is consulted.' "
How is the tape test used in diagnosing pinworms?,"'If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle (supplied by your health care professional) are applied to the anal region. The eggs (and sometimes the parasites themselves) adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified by examination under a microscope. The test is sometimes referred to as ""the Tape Test.""''The test should be done as soon the affected individual wakes up in the morning (because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove most eggs and parasites). The exam may require several samples for diagnosis. Samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs (since scratching of the anal area is common by affected individuals).''At night, the adult worms can sometimes be seen directly in bedclothes or around the anal area: this is another good time to detect the parasites with the transparent adhesive tape method.' "
Are there natural or home remedies that treat pinworms?,'There are many natural and/or home remedies for pinworms although there is a lack of data to support claims. Some of the many suggested remedies include the following:''The above are just a few of the remedies. Check with your doctors before using these remedies.'   Garlic Coconut (grated) Grapefruit seed extract and paste Grated carrots daily Onion juice three times per day for two days Pumpkin seeds Wormwood extract
What are treatment options and medications for pinworms?,"'Most pinworm infections are treated at home with the above medications. However, reinfection is fairly common. To both reduce the chances for reinfection and to help prevent others from getting pinworms, see the ''prevention'' section.''Pinworm infections can be cured; usually by three doses of medication, each three weeks apart. Individuals are encouraged to follow-up with their doctor to be sure treatment has been effective.'   Usually, a single tablet of mebendazole (Vermox) is used as pinworm medicine. This can sometimes be repeated a week later or, if infection persists, the medication is given again three weeks later. Some clinicians recommend a treatment protocol of a drug dose every three weeks, three times, so that the person has effective drug treatment for about nine weeks total. Vermox has been discontinued in the U.S., but stocks are still available in some pharmacies. Another effective medication is albendazole (Albenza) but it may require other medications to reduce the inflammation of the central nervous system, a side effect of the drug. Albendazole is well tolerated with minimal side effects due to minimal systemic absorption. Pyrantel pamoate (Pin-Rid, Pin-X) is available over the counter for pinworm after confirmation of the diagnosis by a licensed health care practitioner. Drugs available over the counter vary from country to country. Pyrantel is the treatment of choice for pregnant women. To treat pinworms affecting urinary and genital organs, combination therapy with oral mebendazole (Vermox) and ivermectin (Stromectol) for the worms as well as topical therapy for the eggs may be required."
What happens if pinworms aren't treated?,"'Untreated pinworms may cause or have a role in causing:''Complications may include ''endometriosis'', salpingitis, ''urethritis'', ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), vulvovaginitis, and possibly ''appendicitis''.' Diarrhea Significant malabsorption of food Weight loss Genital itching Bedwetting (enuresis) Main during urination (dysuria) Vaginal discharge which can be associated with genital skin irritation and rash"
Is it possible to prevent pinworms?,"'Good hygiene will help reduce the spread of the parasites.' Hand washing after handling bedding, diapers, underwear, and other items like child toilet seats, toys, changing tables, and other surfaces that may contain the infective pinworm eggs will also help prevent spread of the parasite. Cleaning under the fingernails and not biting the fingernails will also help reduce the chance of contacting the parasites. Change and wash clothes in hot water daily, especially underwear, to help prevent spreading the disease. Treating everyone infected in a household at the same time may help prevent recurrence and spread to others. Because the eggs remain infective for up to three weeks in a moist environment, prevention of spread and reinfection is difficult but possible."
What is pinworm infection?,"'Pinworm infection'' is caused by the helminth (''Enterobius vermicularis''), a small, white parasitic worm. The pinworm is about the length of a staple (ranges from 2 to 13 mm [0.08 to 0.5 inches]) and lives for the most part in the rectum of humans. While an infected person is asleep, female ''pinworms'' exit the ''intestines'' through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become infectious (capable of infecting another person). Pinworm eggs can survive up to three weeks on clothing, bedding, or other objects if the environment is sufficiently moist.' "
What is the pinworm test?,"'If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle (supplied by your healthcare provider) is applied to the anal region. The tape can pick up both eggs and occasionally the adult worms. Most clinicians suggest the test be done as soon as the person awakens and before any bowel movement or cleansing (bath, shower) as these actions tend to remove the eggs and parasites from the anal/rectal area.''The pinworm eggs or a few adult worms adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified by examination under an ordinary microscope by a qualified laboratory technician.''In some individuals, it is possible to see the adult worms without a microscope, but the transparent eggs are small and can only be seen with a microscope.'

When should the pinworm test be done?,'The test should be done as soon as you wake up in the morning (because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove eggs). The exam may require several samples for a positive diagnosis. Researchers suggest that repeating the test at about three different intervals yields about a 90% detection rate.' 
"Aside from the anal region, what other area can be tested for pinworms?",'Samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs (since scratching of the anal area is common).' 
Can I see the pinworms myself?,"'At night, the adult worms can sometimes be seen directly on the bedclothes or around the anal area. The best time for observation is at night when ''itching'' in the anal/rectal area awakens a person; it is likely the sensation caused by migrating female worms depositing eggs and irritating the skin (see the following section).' "
What do pinworms look like?,"'The pinworms are white, can be seen with the naked eye (no magnification) and are about the length of a staple (about 8-13 mm for female and 2-5mm for male worms). The eggs that are laid by the female worms are not visible as they are about 55 micrometers in diameter and are translucent (see Figure 1).''The male and female worms live for the most part within the rectum of humans but have a life cycle in humans that involves rectal/oral transmission (see Figure 2).''While an infected person is asleep, female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. This causes ''itching'' and irritation of the surrounding area; children especially will scratch the rectal/anal area, get eggs on their fingers or underneath their fingernails and transport the infective eggs to bedding, toys, other humans, or back to themselves. The eggs hatch into larval forms in the small intestines and then progress to the ''large intestine'' where they mature, mate, and progress to the rectal/anal area where females deposit about 10 to 15 thousand eggs.' "
What does the lifecycle of a pinworm look like?, 
What is piriformis syndrome? Who gets it?,"'Piriformis syndrome is uncommon; health care professionals diagnose less than 200,000 people with this condition per year in the U.S. This syndrome usually starts with single-''leg pain'', tingling, or numbness in the back and/or buttock area that can extend down the back of the leg (thigh) following the ''sciatic nerve'' and cause sciatic ''nerve pain''. ''Nerve compression'' by spasm or contracture of the piriformis muscle causes piriformis syndrome (also termed piriformis muscle syndrome). The piriformis muscle is a flat muscle located in the buttocks. It stabilizes the hip joint and can lift and rotate the thigh away from the body. This muscle pairs with the obturator externus muscle to pull the lower pelvis toward the back.''Pseudo-''sciatica'', wallet ''sciatica'', and hip socket neuropathy are other names for piriformis syndrome. It is often associated with repetitive actions taken during sports (for example, long-distance ''running'', playing tennis, or football injuries with trauma to the buttocks).' "
What are causes and risk factors for piriformis syndrome?,"'The causes for piriformis syndrome are related to the location of the sciatic nerve in relation to the piriformis muscle; the sciatic nerve passes out of the pelvis by four routes. Spasm or swelling of the piriformis muscle can cause signs and symptoms due to pressure placed on the various areas of the sciatic nerve that are adjacent to the muscle.''Risk factors for piriformis syndrome may include the following, which often occur due to sports injuries:''Individuals who develop the following in or near the piriformis muscles are also at risk:' Inflammation (any cause such as overuse, sprain) Trauma (usually blunt trauma to the buttocks) Hematoma Scar formation Cysts Tumors Pseudo-aneurysms"

What tests and procedures diagnose piriformis syndrome?,"""Unfortunately, there is no definitive test for piriformis syndrome. However, frequently the patient has a history of trauma or overuse activity. During the patient's physical exam, palpating or moving the patient's piriformis muscle in certain directions may elicit pain. Because piriformis syndrome is a relatively infrequent cause of ""'sciatica'' and ''low back pain'' (its estimated incidence is about 6%), health care professionals usually perform other tests to rule out other causes of sciatic ''nerve compression'', such as herniated discs, back ''sprains'', lumbosacral ''spondylolisthesis'', spinal stenosis, and many others. Tests such as ''X-rays'' can rule out bone ''fractures''. CT, ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging''), electromyography (''EMG'', neurography or electrophysiologic tests), and injection of trigger points in the piriformis muscle with an anesthetic (''lidocaine'', for example) can help the physician determine whether the symptoms are due to piriformis syndrome or other conditions like a ''herniated disc''.' "
What are the treatments and medications for piriformis syndrome? What is the recovery time?,"'Treatment options and medications for piriformis syndrome are usually considered for three different phases: acute phase, recovery phase, and maintenance phase.'   Acute phase: Treatment consists of rest and initial physical therapy, in which an individual performs flexion, rotation, and other basic movements to stretch the piriformis muscle. A physical therapist can administer soft-tissue massage to the gluteal and lumbosacral areas as well as cold packs and occasionally electrical stimulation. Occupational therapy to avoid prolonged sitting that can increase symptoms is also utilized. Infrequently, surgical intervention may release the pressure on the sciatic nerve. Some patients benefit from transrectal massage and/or therapeutic ultrasound treatment. In addition, manual manipulation, often used by osteopathic physicians, can help stretch out the piriformis muscle. Medications used during the acute phase are:Local injection of anesthetics (lidocaine [Xylocaine], bupivacaine [Exparel, Sensorcaine, Marcaine])Oral NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) over-the-counter like ibuprofen (Motrin and others), and/orIn the US, about 10.3 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids.Doctors and other healthcare professions are now regulated very closely by the US DEA because of potential addiction to opiates like Norco, Vicodin, and OxyContin, and other narcotics.Some doctors treat piriformis syndrome with muscle relaxants and/or corticosteroids.

Patients may use the same medications described above but with less frequency. Maintenance phase: The patient should follow the recommended exercise program for increasing stability and strength as suggested by their physician. Because many people who develop piriformis syndrome are athletes, they should slowly resume training over long periods, possibly over several period of months, depending upon the initial severity of the syndrome. Such athletes can return to competition if they demonstrate pain-free range of motion and strength of the piriformis muscle; recovery time varies from person to person."
Will surgery cure piriformis syndrome?,"'If the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is performed correctly, surgery can be a good treatment option in patients with refractory sciatica despite appropriate conservative treatments.' "
"What exercises, home treatments, and therapies (massage, acupuncture) relieve piriformis syndrome pain and inflammation?","'Although many individuals, especially professional athletes, who develop piriformis syndrome may require that health professionals assist them for physical therapy, there are also home remedies that can help patients with piriformis syndrome. For example, some physicians suggest that stretches and/or exercises at home be part of the basic rehabilitation program. Home exercises such as lying in bed and then rolling from side to side with the knees flexed and then extended, rotating from side to side standing, and lying flat on the back and moving the legs as if peddling a bicycle may reduce symptoms.' Taking warm baths, in which the full body is immersed, may also be helpful. Cold packs may help reduce inflammation. Massage may reduce muscle tension, and yoga may help. Some patients use acupuncture to relieve discomfort."
"Which doctors, specialists, or healthcare professionals treat piriformis syndrome?","'A number of different doctors and health professionals may be involved in the treatment of piriformis syndrome. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, orthopedic, chiropractic, sports medicine, and rehabilitation physicians may be involved. Physical and occupational therapists may be part of the treatment team. Infrequently, a surgeon or an OB-GYN\xa0physician may be involved if surgery or a vaginal approach to injection therapy in women is needed.' "
What is the prognosis of piriformis syndrome? Will it ever go away?,"'If health care professionals diagnose piriformis syndrome early and the underlying cause treated, and\xa0the prognosis usually is good. However;\xa0piriformis syndrome in some people is diagnosed later in the disease. A later diagnosis has a less favorable prognosis if the disease has become chronic.' "
Can you prevent piriformis syndrome?,'It is possible to prevent some individuals from getting piriformis syndrome by avoiding overuse of and trauma to the low back/gluteal muscles.

What is a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor)?,"'A prolactinoma is a benign tumor (called an adenoma) of the ''pituitary gland'"". A prolactinoma produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is a natural hormone which supports a woman's normal lactation, which is the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breast. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia)."" "
What is the normal function of prolactin?,"'Prolactin stimulates the breast tissues to enlarge during  ''pregnancy'"".  After delivery of the baby, the mother's prolactin level falls unless she breastfeeds her infant.  Each time the baby nurses from the breasts, prolactin levels rise to maintain milk production."" "
What is the pituitary gland?,"'Sometimes called the master gland, the pituitary gland plays a critical role in regulating growth and development, metabolism, and reproduction.  This gland produces prolactin and a number of other key hormones including:' Growth hormone, which as the name indicates, regulates 
growth; ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone) which stimulates the adrenal 
glands to produce cortisol, especially during 
stressful events (surgery, etc.) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which signals the thyroid gland to produce thyroid 
hormone; and Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which 
regulate ovulation and estrogen and progesterone production in women, 
and sperm formation and testosterone production in men. "
Where is the pituitary gland located?,"'The pituitary gland is located in the middle of the head in a bony box that looks like a saddle and is called the sella turcica. Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland. The nerves for the eyes pass directly above the pituitary gland.' "
What problems are caused by a pituitary tumor?,"'Pituitary tumors may impair or cause an increase in the production of one or more pituitary hormones. The lesion itself can damage surrounding normal tissue and thereby reduce the function of the pituitary gland (a condition called hypopituitarism).''Enlargement of the pituitary gland can also cause local symptoms, such as ''headaches'' (because of increased pressure if the fluid system bathing the brain is blocked or stimulated), or visual disturbances (because of the proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic nerves).'  "
How common is a prolactinoma?,"'Prolactinoma is one of the common type of pituitary tumors. Routine  ''autopsy'' (postmortem) studies have shown that about a quarter of the U.S. population have small pituitary tumors. About 40% of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered clinically significant because they cause no symptoms or problems. Clinically significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people (or 1 in about 7,000 people).' "
What are the types of prolactinomas?,"'Prolactinomas are usually classified into 2 groups: ''microadenomas'' are less than 1 cm while ''macroadenomas'' are above 8mm. The size may play a role in symptoms caused by local compression, and may determine the therapy of choice.' "
What causes a prolactinoma?,"'Although research continues to find causes of disordered cell growth, the sources of many pituitary tumors, including prolactinomas, still remain unknown.''Most pituitary tumors appear sporadically, meaning that no one else in the family has had a pituitary tumor. ''Some patients with prolactinomas have a ''genetic disorder'' called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1).  MEN1 is an ''inherited'' condition characterized by a high frequency of ''peptic ulcer'' disease and abnormal hormone production from the pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary glands.  Prolactinomas are a characteristic feature of MEN1.''A small number of people have a familial tendency to develop prolactinomas but do not appear to have MEN1.  The gene(s) responsible for such cases of prolactinoma have not yet been fully identified.' "
What symptoms are caused by a prolactinoma?,"'In women, high blood levels of prolactin usually interfere with ovulation, causing ''infertility'' and changing ''menstruation''.  In some women, periods may disappear altogether whereas in others, periods become irregular, or menstrual flow may change noticeably.  Women who are not ''pregnant'' or ''nursing'' may begin producing ''breast milk''.  Some women may experience a loss of libido (interest in sex).  Intercourse may become painful because of ''vaginal dryness''.''In men, the most common symptom of prolactinoma is ''impotence''.  Men have no reliable indicator such as ''menstruation'' to signal a problem.  Thus, many men delay going to the doctor until they have ''headaches'' or vision problems, caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the nearby nerves from the eyes.  Men may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido.  In fact, only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. As a result of later presentation, men on average, have larger prolactinomas at their presentation then women.'  "
"Aside from a prolactinoma, what else can cause prolactin levels to 
rise?","'In some people, high blood levels of prolactin can be traced to causes other than a prolactinoma. Other causes include:' Prescription drugs: Prolactin secretion in the pituitary 
is normally suppressed by the brain chemical, dopamine. Drugs that 
block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine 
stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. 
These drugs include the major tranquilizers trifluoperazine (Stelazine) and haloperidol (Haldol); metoclopramide (Reglan) 
used to treat gastroesophageal reflux and the nausea caused by 
certain cancer drugs; and less often, alpha 
methyldopa and 
reserpine 
(Harmonyl) used to control hypertension. Other pituitary tumors: Other tumors may block the flow of dopamine from the brain, which normally inhibits its prolactin-secreting cells.  Such so-called 
""mixed"" tumors arise in or near the pituitary, and include those that release excessive growth hormone (acromegaly) or stimulate cortisol production (Cushing's syndrome).  These can also cause the pituitary to secrete more prolactin. Some nonpituitary tumors: Prolactin secretion can also be 
caused by certain cancers, such as lung cancer. Hypothyroidism: Increased prolactin levels are often seen 
in people with hypothyroidism, and doctors routinely test people with 
hyperprolactinemia for hypothyroidism. Breast stimulation can modestly increase the 
amount of prolactin in the blood. Chest wall trauma (for example, an injury from a car steering wheel after an accident) can lead to 
increased levels of prolactin. Marijuana use is also a well documented cause of elevated levels of prolactin."
How is a prolactinoma diagnosed?,"'Elevations of the prolactin hormone in the body are detected by a blood test.  Prolactin blood levels are often  indicated in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea), irregular menses, or ''infertility'' and,  in men with impaired sexual function or milk secretion (very rare in men).''If the prolactin level is high, thyroid function will usually be checked and questions asked about conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is the most sensitive test for detecting and measuring prolactinomas. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computer tomography (''CT scan'') also provides an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI for detection of a prolactinoma.''In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor on the MRI, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues.' "
What follow-up tests are done after a prolactinoma diagnosis?,"'When a prolactinoma is found, other tests are often done to assess production of additional hormones from the pituitary gland.''Depending on the size of the tumor, the doctor may also request an eye exam to measure visual fields. Remember that the optic nerves run close to the pituitary gland, and any growth of this gland may lead to impingement  on the these nerves.' "
What are the goals of treatment of a prolactinoma?,"'The goals for treatment of a prolactinoma are to:''If the tumor is very large, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.' return prolactin secretion to normal,  reduce tumor size,  correct any vision abnormalities, and  restore the normal function of the pituitary gland.  "
How is a prolactinoma treated?,"'Prolactinomas are usually initially treated with medications. ''Surgery is considered if the medications cannot be tolerated, or if they are not effective.''The medical treatment may be only partially successful. In such cases, the medications may be combined with surgery or ''radiation therapy''.'  "
"What medications are used to treat
prolactinomas?","'Because dopamine is the chemical in the brain that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, doctors may treat prolactinomas with drugs that act like dopamine such as ''bromocriptine'' (''Parlodel'') or ''cabergoline'' (''Dostinex''). Both bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia (high blood prolactin levels). Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is also approved for the treatment of infertility. Treatment with these drugs is successful in shrinking the tumor and returning prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80% of cases, or four out of every five patients.''Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is associated with side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''dizziness''.  To avoid these side effects, it is important that the dose of bromocriptine be increased slowly. Transvaginal use of bromocriptine is documented as a safe alternative route for delivery if nausea is excessive. In general, side effects typically disappear while the drug continues to lower prolactin levels.''Bromocriptine (Parlodel) treatment should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist. Prolactin levels often rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every two years on a trial basis.''Cabergoline (Dostinex) is also associated with side effects such as nausea and ''dizziness'', but these effects are usually less common and less severe than with bromocriptine.  As with bromocriptine therapy, side effects may be avoided if treatment is started gradually. Recently, the use of Dostinex has been linked to ''heart'' valve problems. Many endocrinologists are using Dostinex as a last resort if bromocriptine simply cannot be tolerated. '""If side effects develop with a higher dose, the doctor may return to the previous dosage.  If a patient's prolactin blood level remains normal for six months, the doctor might consider stopping treatment.""'Medical therapy can often shrink a prolactinoma such that surgery is not required.' "
What is the surgical treatment of a prolactinoma?,"'The surgical treatment of prolactinomas involves delicately opening the brain to remove the tumor in the pituitary gland.''The results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin level as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon.  The higher the prolactin level, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin.  At best, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients whose blood prolactin level is below 250 mg/mL.  Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery.  Drug therapy may also be started before surgery to ""debulk"" the tumor for the surgical procedure. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that in 20% to 50% of cases, the tumor will return, usually within five years.' "
How do I choose a skilled neurosurgeon?,"'Because the results of surgery are so dependent on the skill and knowledge of the neurosurgeon, patients should ask the surgeon about the number of operations he or she has performed to remove pituitary tumors, and for success and complication rates in comparison to major medical centers. Surgeons who have performed many hundreds or even thousands of such operations usually produce the best results.' "
Does a prolactinoma affect pregnancy and oral contraceptives?,"'If a woman has a small prolactinoma, there is usually no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than one percent of pregnant women with prolactinomas. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater. If a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy, the likelihood of future successful ''pregnancies'' is extremely high.''A woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to pregnancy. This evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields.''As soon as the patient becomes pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex). Patients should consult their hormone specialists (endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop - particularly ''headaches'', visual changes, nausea,  ''vomiting'', excessive ''thirst'' or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy.' "
Do prolactinomas affect oral contraceptives?,"'In the past, ''oral contraceptives'' (''birth control pills'') were thought to contribute to the development of prolactinomas. However, this notion is no longer held to be true. Patients with prolactinomas who are treated with bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex) may also take oral contraceptives. Similarly, post-menopausal ''estrogen replacement'' is safe in patients with prolactinomas who are treated with medical therapy or surgery.' "
Is osteoporosis a risk in women with high prolactin levels?,"'Women whose ovaries produce inadequate estrogen are at an increased risk for ''osteoporosis''. Hyperprolactinemia can cause reduced estrogen production. Although estrogen production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia, even a year or two without estrogen can decrease the strength of the bones. Women should protect themselves from ''osteoporosis'' by regular ''exercise'' and increased calcium intake through ''diet'' or supplementation, and by avoiding  ''smoking''.  Women may want to have ''bone density'' measurements. They may also want to discuss estrogen replacement therapy with their doctors.' "
What is pityriasis rosea and stages?,"'Pityriasis rosea is a common viral infection that usually affects individuals between 10-35 years of age. The ''rash'' typically lasts six to nine weeks, rarely extending longer than 12 weeks.

What is PKD?,"'Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes many fluid-filled cysts to grow in your kidneys. Unlike the usually harmless simple kidney cysts that can form in the kidneys later in life, PKD cysts can change the shape of your kidneys, including making them much larger.''PKD is a form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that reduces kidney function and may lead to kidney failure. PKD also can cause other complications, or problems, such as high blood pressure, cysts in the liver, and problems with blood vessels in your brain and heart.'  "
"What are the causes, symptoms, and types of PKD?","'A gene mutation, or defect, causes PKD. In most PKD cases, a child got the gene mutation from a parent. In a small number of PKD cases, the gene mutation developed on its own, without either parent carrying a copy of the mutated gene. This type of mutation is called “spontaneous.” Read more about genes and genetic conditions.''Two of the common types of PDK are autosomal dominant PDK (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PK (ARPKD)' The signs and symptoms of and complications of ADPKD include pain,high blood pressure, andkidney failure, pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure, PKD does not cause signs or symptoms until your kidney cysts are a half inch or larger in size. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb are larger-than-normal kidneys and a smaller-than-average size baby, a condition called growth failure. The early signs of ARPKD are also complications. Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood or even adulthood. autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), which is usually diagnosed in adulthood autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD), which can be diagnosed in the womb or shortly after a baby is born"
What is autosomal dominant PKD and its symptoms and signs?,"   Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of PKD. ADPKD affects 1 in every 400 to 1,000 people and is the most common kidney disorder passed down through family members. Healthcare providers usually diagnose ADPKD between the ages of 30 and 50, when signs and symptoms start to appear, which is why it is sometimes called “adult PKD.” ""Autosomal dominant"" means you can get the PKD gene mutation, or defect, from only one parent. Researchers have found two different gene mutations that cause ADPKD. Most people with ADPKD have defects in the PKD1 gene, and 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 7 people with ADPKD have a defective PKD2 gene. Healthcare providers can diagnose people with PKD1 sooner because their symptoms appear sooner. People with PKD1 also usually progress more quickly to kidney failure than people with PKD2. How quickly ADPKD progresses also differs from person to person. In many cases, ADPKD doesn’t cause signs or symptoms until cysts are a half inch or larger in size. For this reason, you should meet with a healthcare provider if you are at risk for PKD before your symptoms start. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) The most common symptoms are pain in the back and sides, between the ribs and hips, and headaches. The pain can be short term or ongoing, mild or severe. Hematuria, or blood in the urine, may be a sign of ADPKD. If you have symptoms or signs of hematuria, see a healthcare provider right away.

What are common and other complications of ADPKD?,"'Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Common and other complications of ADPKD\xa0include:''Pain.'' Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused by''High blood pressure.'' Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage.''Kidney failure.\xa0''Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to ''coma'' and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70.''Kidney cancer''.'' ADPKD complications, or problems, can affect many systems in your body besides your kidneys. Researchers have not found a link between PKD and kidney ''cancer''.''Abnormal heart valves.'' Abnormal heart valves can occur in some people with ADPKD. Abnormal heart valves can cause too little blood to flow into the ''aorta'', the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of your body. Abnormal heart valves in people with ADPKD rarely need to be replaced. However, you may need more tests if your healthcare provider detects a ''heart murmur''.''Brain aneurysms. ''An ''aneurysm'' is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Aneurysms in the brain might cause ''headaches'' that are severe or feel different from other headaches. See a healthcare provider even before you take ''over-the-counter'' pain medicines for severe headaches or headaches that won’t go away.''Brain aneurysms can break open and cause bleeding inside the skull. Large brain aneurysms are life threatening and need immediate medical treatment. If you have an ''aneurysm'', stop ''smoking'' and control your blood pressure and ''lipids''.''Liver cysts.'' Liver cysts, which are fluid-filled cysts on the liver, are the most common nonkidney complication of ADPKD. Liver cysts don’t usually cause symptoms in people under age 30, because liver cysts are normally small and few in number in the early stages of ADPKD. In rare cases, liver cysts can eventually reduce ''liver function''. In the most severe cases, you may need a liver transplant.''Because the hormone estrogen may affect ''liver cyst'' growth, women are more likely to have liver cysts than men. The more ''pregnancies'' a woman with ADPKD has had, the more likely she will have liver cysts.''Pancreatic cysts.'' PKD can also cause cysts in your pancreas. Pancreatic cysts rarely cause ''pancreatitis'', which is inflammation, or swelling, of the pancreas.''Diverticula. ''Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that push through weak spots in your colon wall. Diverticula can cause ''diverticulosis''. ''Diverticulosis'' can cause changes in your bowel movement patterns or pain in your abdomen.''Urinary tract infections'' (UTIs).'' Kidney cysts can block urine flow through the kidneys so that urine stays in your urinary tract too long. When urine stays in your urinary tract too long, bacteria in your urine can cause a ''bladder infection'' or a ''kidney infection''. A kidney infection can cause further damage to your kidneys by causing cysts to become infected.''Kidney stones.'' People with ADPKD sometimes have kidney stones. Kidney stones can block urine flow and cause infection and pain.''Although most women with PKD have normal pregnancies, women with PKD who have high blood pressure and decreased kidney function are more likely to have ''preeclampsia'', or high blood pressure during ''pregnancy''.''With ''preeclampsia'', the fetus gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Women with preeclampsia should be followed closely by their health care provider during and after pregnancy. After delivery, preeclampsia goes away.''Many men with ADPKD have cysts on their seminal vesicles, which are glands in the male reproductive system that help produce semen. Seminal vesicle cysts rarely cause ''infertility''.''People with PKD who are considering having children may want to discuss ''family planning'' concerns with a genetics counselor.' kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. You may see some ADPKD complications right away. Other complications may not appear for many years, depending on whether you have the PKD1 or PKD2 gene. ADPKD complications can vary from person to person, so you may not have all of these problems."
What procedures and tests diagnose PDK?,"'Health care providers diagnose ADPKD using imaging tests and genetic testing. A healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on these tests and your age, family history of PKD, and how many cysts you have.\xa0The sooner a healthcare provider can diagnose ADPKD, the better your chances of delaying complications.''A specially trained technician performs imaging tests in a healthcare provider’s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital.\xa0 A radiologist reads the images.\xa0 Adults usually don’t need anesthesia for these tests. However, a healthcare\xa0provider may give infants or children a sedative to help them fall asleep during the test.''Ultrasound. ''Ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe, painless sound waves off your organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of your entire urinary tract or focus specifically on the kidneys. The images can show cysts in the kidneys.''Computed tomography (CT) scans. ''CT scans'' use a combination of ''x-rays'' and computer technology to create images of your urinary tract. For a ''CT scan'' of your urinary tract, a health care provider may give you an injection of contrast medium. Contrast medium is a dye or other substance that makes structures inside your body easier to see during imaging tests. You lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes the x-rays. CT scans can show more detailed images of kidney cysts than ultrasound.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI). ''MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of your body’s internal organs and soft tissues without using x-rays. An MRI may include an injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, you lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine that may be open on each end or closed at one end. Some newer machines allow you to lie in a more open space. Health care providers use ''MRIs'' to measure kidney and cyst size and monitor kidney and cyst growth. Measuring kidney and cyst size and growth can help track the progress of PKD.' "
How are the most common complications of ADPKD treated?,"'Although a cure doesn’t exist yet for ADPKD, treatment can help reduce your complications, which can help you live longer.''A health care provider needs to find the source of your pain before he or she can treat it. For example, if growing cysts are causing pain, the health care provider may first suggest over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines such as ''aspirin'' or ''acetaminophen''.''Always talk with a health care provider before taking any OTC medicines because some may be harmful to your kidneys. People with ADPKD have a higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), which is the sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. Sometimes AKI is caused by using OTC painkillers for a long time.''Depending on the size and number of cysts and whether medicine helps your pain, a health care provider may suggest surgery. Surgery to shrink cysts can help pain in your back and sides for a while. However, surgery does not slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure.''Controlling your blood pressure can slow the effects of ADPKD. Lifestyle changes and medicines can lower high blood pressure. Sometimes you can control blood pressure with healthy eating and regular physical activity alone.''Some health care providers will recommend blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'').''ADPKD can eventually cause your kidneys to fail. People with kidney failure must have dialysis or a kidney transplant to replace their kidney function.''The two forms of dialysis are ''hemodialysis'' and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate your blood through a filter outside the body. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen to filter the blood inside the body.''A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a donor into your body.' "
What is autosomal recessive ARPKD?,"'Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 20,000 children. A fetus or baby with ARPKD has fluid-filled kidney cysts that may make the kidneys too big, or enlarged. ARPKD can cause a child to have poor kidney function, even in the womb. ARPKD is sometimes called “infantile PKD” because health care providers can diagnose it so early in life.''Poor kidney function can cause breathing problems that can threaten the life of a fetus or baby. About 30 percent of newborns with ARPKD die within their first week of life. A baby with ARPKD who survives birth and the first few weeks of life has a good chance of surviving into adulthood. However, children or young adults with ARPKD will likely need medical treatment their whole life.''""Autosomal recessive"" means that for a child to have this disorder, both parents must have and pass along the gene mutation. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disorder, although the child may get the gene mutation. The child is a “carrier” of the disorder and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation.''How quickly ARPKD progresses to kidney failure is different for each child. The sooner a fetus is diagnosed in the womb, the better the child’s outlook. Getting good ''prenatal care'' is important for increasing a child’s survival rate. Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help parents manage their child’s PKD.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of ARPKD?,"'The early signs of ARPKD often appear during the first few months of life and in the womb. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb can cause serious health problems. For this reason, it is important for a woman who is at risk for passing PKD to her children to get ''prenatal'' care as soon as she learns she is ''pregnant''.''Enlarged kidney.'' An early sign of ARPKD is an enlarged kidney. Enlarged kidneys put pressure on a fetus’ or child’s lungs, which can make lung growth and breathing harder. A health care provider can see enlarged kidneys in a fetus or an infant using ultrasound imaging, also called a ''sonogram''.''Growth failure. ''Due to decreased kidney and lung function, children with ARPKD are usually smaller-than-average size, a condition called growth failure.''Low levels of amniotic fluid. ''Decreased kidney function can cause low levels of amniotic fluid in a mother’s womb. Low levels of amniotic fluid can cause breathing problems in the fetus.''Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood, or even adulthood.' "
How are the common complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Health care providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help manage these complications.''Breathing problems in infants''Liver problems''High blood pressure in children'   Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused bykidney cyst infection,bleeding or burst kidney cysts,urinary tract infection,kidney stones,tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and  high blood pressure. Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage. Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to coma and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70. Children with ARPKD who survive birth often have kidney and liver problems that can affect their breathing. Children born with ARPKD often develop kidney failure before reaching adulthood. Babies with the most severe cases of ARPKD often die hours or days after birth because they cannot breathe well enough to live. Their lungs do not develop as they should in the womb. Liver scarring occurs in all cases of ARPKD and is usually present at birth. Liver scarring can lead to decreased liver function and other liver problems. However, liver problems from ARPKD tend to become more of a concern over time.  Most children with ARPKD have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases a child’s chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also further damage a child’s kidneys."
How are other complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Healthcare providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Enlarged kidney. ''Kidney enlargement cannot be prevented or reversed. One or both kidneys may need to be removed if their size makes breathing impossible. Children who don’t have working kidneys will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.''Growth failure.'' A health care provider may treat growth failure with nutritional therapy . In severe cases of growth failure, a health care provider and a child’s parents may consider treatment with human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is a prescribed, man-made hormone that can help children grow.''Breathing problems.'' Health care providers treat infants with breathing problems with artificial ventilation, which allows them to breathe with the help of a machine.''Kidney failure. ''Peritoneal dialysis is the preferred method of treating children with kidney failure, although health care providers also use hemodialysis. Kidney transplants may be a limited option for infants because of their size.''Liver problems. ''If serious ''liver disease'' develops, some children may need to have a combined liver and kidney transplant.''High blood pressure.'' A health care provider can help control blood pressure with medicines. Treating high blood pressure can help delay kidney failure.' "
Can diet and lifestyle changes slow the progression of PKD?,"'Your healthcare provider will use lab tests to watch your levels of these ''minerals''.''If lifestyle and diet changes don’t help control your blood pressure, a health care provider may prescribe one or more blood pressure medicines. Two types of blood pressure medicines, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may slow kidney disease and delay kidney failure. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan.''If you have any kind of chronic kidney disease, including polycystic kidney disease (PKD), talk with a dietitian about which foods to include in your diet and which foods might be harmful. Find a dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease to help you choose the right foods and plan healthy meals.' The sooner you know you or your child has PKD, the sooner you can keep the condition from getting worse. Getting tested if you or your child are at risk for PKD can help you take early action.  PKD may require diet changes to help lower your blood pressure by limiting how much sodium (salt) you eat. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein also can help protect the kidneys. As your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods lower in phosphorus and potassium. You may need to change what you eat and drink to help control your blood pressure and protect your kidneys. People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about which foods and drinks to include in their healthy eating plan and which may be harmful. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Be active for 30 minutes or more on most days. Regular physical activity can help you reduce stress, manage your weight, and control your blood pressure. If you are not active now, ask your health care provider about how much and what type of physical activity is right for you. If you play contact sports, such as football or hockey, a healthcare provider should do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test to see whether these sports are safe for you. Trauma to your body, especially to your back and sides, may cause kidney cysts to burst. Lose weight. Being overweight makes your kidneys work harder. Losing weight helps protect your kidneys. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Getting enough sleep is important to your overall physical and mental health and can help you manage your blood pressure and blood glucose, or blood sugar. Reduce stress. Long-term stress can raise your blood pressure and even lead to depression. Some of the steps you take to manage your PKD are also healthy ways to cope with stress. For example, getting enough physical activity and sleep helps reduce stress. Quit smoking. Cigarette smoking can raise your blood pressure, making your kidney damage worse. Quitting smoking may help you meet your blood pressure goals, which is good for your kidneys and can lower your chances of having a heart attack or stroke. Quitting smoking is even more important for people with PKD who have aneurysms. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Take blood pressure medications."
How does ADPKD affect your day-to-day life?,"'Managing PKD successfully will probably include several lifestyle changes, such as changes in your physical activity level and what you eat. Visiting with a health care team on a regular basis is an important part of your routine as you work to limit your kidney problems.''PKD is a costly disease to manage and treat, especially if health insurance doesn’t cover some or any of your costs. Financial help may be available from the Federal Government and other sources. Visit the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website or talk with your health care team for more information.''Many people with PKD may find it hard, but not impossible, to get life insurance. Contact an insurance company that specializes in “impaired risk life insurance.”' "
Can you prevent PKD?,"'Researchers have not yet found a way to prevent PKD. However, you may be able to slow PKD problems caused by high blood pressure, such as kidney damage. Aim for a blood pressure goal of less than 120/80. Work with a health care team to help manage your or your child’s PKD. The health care team will probably include a general practitioner and a nephrologist, a health care provider specializing in kidney health.' "
What is genetic testing?,"'Your healthcare provider may refer you to a geneticist if you are at risk for ADPKD. A geneticist is an expert in genes and diseases that are passed down through families. You will provide the geneticist with a blood or saliva sample, which will be tested in a special lab for the gene mutations that cause ADPKD. The genetic testing may take many days or weeks to complete.''A healthcare provider may also use genetic testing results to find out whether someone with a family history of PKD is likely to develop PKD in the future.' "
When should you consider genetic counseling?,"'If you are considering genetic testing, you and your family may want to talk with a genetics counselor as part of your health care team. Genetic counseling may be useful when you’re deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available. Genetic counseling can help you and your family understand how test results may affect your lives.' "
What is phenylketonuria?,"'Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the ''diet''. It is found in all proteins and in some ''artificial sweeteners''. If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.'  "
How common is phenylketonuria?,"'The occurrence of PKU varies among ethnic groups and geographic regions worldwide. In the United States, PKU occurs in 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 (newborns. Most cases of PKU are detected shortly after birth by newborn screening, and treatment is started promptly. As a result, the severe signs and symptoms of classic PKU are rarely seen.' "
What genes are related to phenylketonuria?,"'Mutations in the ''PAH'' gene cause phenylketonuria.''The ''PAH'' gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts the amino acid phenylalanine to other important compounds in the body. If gene mutations reduce the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine from the diet is not processed effectively. As a result, this amino acid can build up to toxic levels in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage.''Classic PKU, the most severe form of the disorder, occurs when phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is severely reduced or absent. People with untreated classic PKU have levels of phenylalanine high enough to cause severe brain damage and other serious medical problems. Mutations in the ''PAH'' gene that allow the enzyme to retain some activity result in milder versions of this condition, such as variant PKU or non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.''Changes in other genes may influence the severity of PKU, but little is known about these additional genetic factors.' "
How do people inherit phenylketonuria?,"'This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "
What other names do people use for phenylketonuria?," Deficiency Disease, Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Folling Disease Folling's Disease PAH Deficiency Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency Disease PKU "
What is plague? What is the history of plague?,"'Plague is a bacterial disease that is infamous for causing millions of deaths due to a pandemic (widespread epidemic) during the Middle Ages in Europe, peaking in the 14th century. Many historical references describe the illness, which has been referred to as the Black Death or a ""pestilence in the air."" The first reported plague pandemic began in 541 A.D. and lasted for over 200 years, killing an estimated 100 million people or more throughout the Mediterranean basin. The so-called Black Death, or pandemic of the Middle Ages, began in China and made its way to Europe, causing the death of 60% of the entire population. The third, or modern, pandemic started in China in the 19th century and spread to many parts of the world in port cities. More recently, the World Health Organization reported an outbreak of plague in Madagascar in November 2014 and again from August through October 30, 2017, with a total of 1,801 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of plague, including 127 deaths according to Madagascar health officials.''Rodents and many other kinds of animals can be infected with plague-causing bacteria. People contract the bacteria through bites of fleas that have fed on plague-infected rodents. Humans can also develop the infection from handling fluids or tissues from infected animals. People with pneumonic plague can also transmit the infection to other humans via ''coughing'' infectious droplets into the air.'  "
What causes plague?,"'The bacterium ''Yersinia pestis'' causes plague. In the natural state, the bacteria infect wild rodents. Plague can still be found in many areas of the world, but 95% of cases today occur in Madagascar and sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization states that between 1,000-2,000 cases are reported each year worldwide, but there are estimated to be more cases that go unreported. The'' Y. pestis ''bacteria are found in the U.S. in semi-arid areas of the southwest. Rat fleas (''Xenopsylla'' species) that feed off of infected animals transmit the bacteria to other animals. Rats, ground squirrels, mice, prairie ''dogs'', chipmunks, voles, and rabbits are examples of animals that may carry the plague bacteria. The bacteria are believed to persist at a low level in natural populations of these animals. When a large number of infected wild rodents die, fleas that have bitten these animals may bite humans and domestic animals. Cats that are bitten usually become ill, and they may ''cough'' infectious droplets into the surrounding air. While infected dogs may not appear ill, they may still carry infected fleas into the home.''The last urban outbreak of human cases of flea-borne plague in the U.S. occurred in the 1920s. Plague in the U.S. is rare today but occasionally occurs in the southwestern portion of the country (including Northern New Mexico, Northern Arizona, and Southern Colorado) where wild rodents may be infected. Between 1900-2017, an average of seven cases of plague occurred each year in the U.S.'  "
What are risk factors for plague?,'Risk factors for plague include being bitten by fleas as well as exposure to rodents. Scratches or bites from infected domestic cats are also a risk factor. Contact with individuals with pneumonic plague is also a risk factor for acquiring the infection.' 
What is the incubation period for plague?,"'Symptoms and signs of plague usually develop between two and seven days after acquiring the ''Yersinia pestis'' infection, although they may appear after only one day in cases of exposure to pneumonic plague.' "
What are plague symptoms and signs? What are the different types of plague?,"'The signs and symptoms of plague may take three forms:''1. Bubonic plague''In this form of the infection, bacteria infiltrate the ''lymph nodes'', causing enlarged, painful, tender lymph nodes called buboes. Accompanying ''flu-like symptoms'' include fever, chills, ''headaches'', and weakness. If not treated, the infection can spread to other areas of the body. This is the most common form seen in the few U.S. infections.''2. Septicemic plague''This form of plague is a result of plague bacteria entering the bloodstream. It can occur on its own or it may develop from bubonic plague. Symptoms include fever, chills, weakness, ''abdominal pain'', and shock. There can be bleeding and tissue death, especially of the fingers and toes. These dying tissues may appear black, hence the name Black Death.''3. Pneumonic plague''In the pneumonic form of the illness, symptoms of other types of plague can be present, but the characteristic clinical picture of ''pneumonia'' is present. The plague bacteria spread to the ''lungs'' or infect the lungs directly when infected droplets in the air are inhaled. This is the only form of plague that can be transmitted from person to person. Shortness of breath, ''chest pain'', fever, and cough with watery or bloody ''mucus'' production are symptoms of pneumonic plague.'  "
Is plague contagious? How does plague spread?,"'Bubonic and septicemic plague are only rarely spread from person to person; transmission occurs when fleas feed on infected rodents and then bite people. Transmission of pneumonic plague to another person typically requires direct and close (within 6 ''feet'') contact with an infected person. Pneumonic plague is ''contagious'' because infected people can spread the bacteria via airborne droplets of sputum. This type of person-to-person spread of plague has not been reported in the U.S. since 1924, but it may still occur in some developing countries.' "
What is the contagious period for pneumonic plague?,"'Plague can be spread by the respiratory secretions of individuals with active infection of pneumonic plague. Though the exact contagious period is not definitively known, it is believed that patients in the early stage of pneumonic plague (the first 24 hours) pose little risk of transmitting the disease. However, patients in the final stages of pneumonic plague who are coughing up visible blood or pus pose a much higher risk of transmitting the disease.' "
How do physicians diagnose plague?,"'The diagnosis of plague is confirmed upon identifying ''Yersinia pestis'"" organisms in a sample of blood or tissue (such as an aspirate from an enlarged lymph node) from the infected patient. Diagnostic tests rely on culturing the organism, demonstrating the surface proteins of the bacteria, or identifying genetic material of the bacteria. Tests to identify the body's antibody response to the infection are also available."" "
What is the treatment for plague?,"'Antibiotics are effective in treating plague. Examples of antibiotics that can be used include ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'', ''Cipro XR'', Proquin XR), streptomycin, gentamicin (''Garamycin''), and ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox''). People with plague are very ill and may require additional treatment, including oxygen, respiratory support, and medications to maintain adequate ''blood pressure''. Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated while in treatment to avoid spreading the infection.' "
What is the prognosis of plague?,"'Plague is a very serious disease, often life-threatening disease. About 50% of people with bubonic plague die if their illness is not treated. Pneumonic plague is typically always fatal if untreated. With treatment, about half of people with pneumonic plague will survive. The earlier that antibiotic treatment is given, the better the chance for recovery.' "
Is it possible to prevent plague? Is there a plague vaccine?,"""There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent plague. It's possible to lessen the chance of contracting plague by rodent-proofing, or reducing rodent habitat areas around the home, avoiding contact with wild rodents, and wearing gloves while handling carcasses of potentially infected animals. Use repellent for skin and clothing while outdoors or in areas where exposure to fleas is likely. DEET-containing repellent can be applied on skin or clothing, while permethrin can be applied to clothing. Use flea-control products on pets, and if pets are allowed to roam free in plague-endemic areas (such as the southwestern U.S.), do not allow them to ""'sleep'' on the bed; this will decrease the chance of transmitting potentially infected fleas. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered to individuals with known exposure to plague or for those who have come in direct contact with infected tissue or body fluids.' "
Could plague be used as a biological weapon?,"'Concerns about plague include the potential for its use as a biological weapon. In fact, ''Yersinia pestis'' has a history of being used for ''bioterrorism''. Historical examples include the catapulting of infected corpses over city walls and dropping infected fleas from airplanes.' "

Introduction to birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'' and physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' includes:''Regardless of the terminology used, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. No method of ''birth control'' available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'', except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. What is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.''Emergency contraception'' is a medication or device that is used to prevent ''conception'' after unprotected intercourse has already occurred. It is not intended for use as a primary method of contraception and is most appropriate as a back-up method. Between 2006 and 2010, about 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US report having used emergency contraception. Emergency contraception can involve the administration of hormones or the insertion of an ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'').' contraception,  pregnancy prevention,  fertility control, and  
family planning.

What is emergency hormonal contraception (morning after pill)?,"'Emergency hormonal contraception is sometimes called ""the morning after pill"" or ""postcoital contraception,"" although these are not the preferred terms, and actually can be misleading. ''It is actually a short course of the hormones found in ''oral contraceptives'' taken at a high dose.'' The exact regimen (the number of pills and the number of days) depends on the type of oral ''contraceptive'' used.'  "
How does the morning after pill work?,"'Depending upon the time during the ''menstrual cycle'' that the emergency contraceptives are taken, these may prevent pregnancy by blocking the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus, by inhibiting ''ovulation'', or by interfering with fertilization of the egg. '  To be considered a possible candidate for emergency contraceptive pills a woman should take the medication within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, 
although there is some evidence that they may be effective in the 5 days 
following intercourse.  Because the pills may be taken up to 72 hours later, the 
term ""morning-after pill"" is misleading.  However, the pills are most effective 
when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. The only known contraindication to emergency contraception is pregnancy, so a woman must not be pregnant when these methods are used. 
	 Emergency hormonal contraception may be taken on any day of the menstrual cycle. 
	"
What are the side effects of the morning after pill?,"'Neither a physical examination nor any laboratory tests are required prior to use of the emergency hormonal contraception. It can be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle, and the next ''menstrual period'' typically occurs within one week of the expected time. The timing of the subsequent menses is, to some extent, dependent upon the time in the cycle at which the emergency contraceptive was taken.' There are no serious side effects, but the pills may cause 
	nausea and vomiting in some women. 
	 These side effects may be controlled by taking an 
	anti-nausea drug such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). 
	 Frequently a doctor will give a prescription nausea medication, such as 
	prochlorperazine (Compazine), at the same time as the emergency contraceptive pill. 
	 A woman may also experience breast tenderness and a temporary disruption of her menstrual cycle. One type of emergency hormonal contraception is available without a prescription in the US for people aged 17 or older (proof of ID is required for purchase). 
	 It is also available for younger
	teens with parental permission."
"What is the dosage, and what types of the morning after pill are available?","'The most common type of emergency hormonal contraception involves the administration of the ''progesterone'' hormone ''levonorgestrel'' in two doses (marketed as ''Plan B'' in the U.S.).''Another formulation for emergency hormonal contraception uses estrogen along with levonorgestrel, but levonorgestrel-only medication may be more effective and causes less nausea compared to estrogen-containing products.''Clinical trials'' using low doses of ''mifepristone'' (known earlier as RU-486, sometimes called ""the abortion pill"") have shown that this agent is extremely effective as an emergency contraceptive when taken prior to ovulation, but it has not been approved for this use in the US. Mifepristone (''Mifeprex'"") has been approved, in much higher doses, for terminating a pregnancy of less than 49 days' duration and must be taken under a physician's supervision.""'Another type of anti-progestin medication that is similar to mifepristone in its structure and actions is known as ulipristal acetate. Ulipristal acetate (Ella) is marketed for emergency contraception in Europe and was approved by the US FDA in August 2010 for use in the US for emergency contraception up to 120 hours after intercourse. It is available by prescription only.''Although effectiveness of the oral contraceptives are dependent to some extent upon how soon after unprotected intercourse they are taken, efficacy studies have generally reported a low rate of pregnancy with use of oral emergency contraception.''Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect women from ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').''Emergency hormonal contraception or the morning after pill is not meant to be a primary birth control method. Once the emergency is over, a woman should receive proper counseling so that she can select an effective and appropriate contraceptive method to use on a regular basis if she continues to be sexually active.' "
What is emergency IUD?,"'Like the high dose of oral hormonal contraceptive, an IUD blocks the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall. \tEmergency IUD insertion can also be used to prevent a pregnancy after unprotected sex. \t''An added advantage of emergency contraceptive use of an IUD compared to pills is that once the IUD is in place, it will provide the woman with a long-term contraceptive method if she chooses.'  Copper IUD insertion is the most effective method of emergency contraception. 
	 If the copper IUD (Paragard) is inserted within 5 days after unprotected sex, it is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. 
	 The copper IUD has the lowest failure rate of all emergency contraception options. Emergency IUD insertion does slightly increase the risk of 
	pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 
	 Contraindications to the use of the emergency IUD include:
known or suspected pregnancy,

Facts you should know about plant thorn arthritis," Plant thorn arthritis is a noninfectious inflammation of a joint as a result of a thorn puncturing the joint and leaving residual plant matter lodged within the joint. Plant thorn arthritis typically affects only a single joint -- the joint that was pierced by the plant thorn. Plant thorn arthritis causes the involved joint to be swollen, slightly reddish, stiff, and painful. The joint loses its full range of motion and is often tender. The symptoms of plant thorn arthritis may occur long after the thorn is removed from the affected joint. The diagnosis of plant thorn arthritis requires either detection of a piece of thorn within the joint by radiology testing or surgical removal of the thorn fragments and identification of the fragments microscopically in the laboratory. Synovectomy is the surgical procedure that is used to cure plant thorn arthritis."
What is plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis is a noninfectious inflammation of a joint as a result of a thorn puncturing the joint and leaving residual plant matter lodged within the joint. The plant thorn fragments cause a localized inflammation reaction in the joint lining tissue that leads to swelling, ''stiffness'', loss of range of motion, and ''pain''. The joint lining tissue is called the synovium. Inflammation of this tissue is medically referred to as synovitis. Plant thorn arthritis is also called plant thorn synovitis.' "
What plants cause plant thorn arthritis?,"'The plants that commonly cause plant thorn arthritis are those that produce thorns. These plants include palm trees, roses, black-thorn shrubs, cacti, bougainvillea, yucca, pyracantha, plum trees, and mesquite trees. Exposure to these plants is the greatest risk factor for plant thorn arthritis.'  "
What are risk factors for plant thorn arthritis?,"'Risk factors for plant thorn arthritis include gardening, especially without gloves, and exposure to thorn-bearing plants, including palm trees, roses, black-thorn shrubs, cacti, bougainvillea, yucca, pyracantha, plum trees, and mesquite trees.' "
What joints are typically involved in plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis typically affects only a single joint -- the joint that was pierced by the plant thorn. The most common joints affected by plant thorn arthritis are those that can be exposed to being stabbed by falling into or brushing up against plants with thorns. Joints that are commonly affected by plant thorn synovitis include the small joints of the hands (metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints), ''feet'', elbows, knees, and ankles.' "
What are plant thorn arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Plant thorn arthritis causes the involved joint to be''The joint loses its full range of motion and is often tender. These symptoms may be noticed only many days after the initial thorn puncture. It is not uncommon for the person affected by plant thorn arthritis to remove the thorn immediately after the puncture and then develop the arthritis many days or weeks later and not even recall that the joint had been punctured previously! This is because the original thorn has actually left behind small fragments of thorn vegetable matter that gradually cause the inflammation of plant thorn arthritis. This form of single joint arthritis (monoarthritis) then becomes chronic until appropriately treated.'   swollen, slightly reddish, stiff, and painful."
What specialties of doctors treat plant thorn arthritis?,'Plant thorn arthritis requires operative intervention. Doctors who perform operative treatments include orthopedic surgeons and ''plastic'' surgeons.' 
How is plant thorn arthritis diagnosed?,"'Plant thorn arthritis is suspected in a patient who presents with a single joint that is inflamed after it has been punctured by a plant thorn. This is true even if the patient recalls removing the thorn, as described above, because the thorn can leave behind tiny fragments of thorn matter that leads to the chronic inflammation of plant thorn arthritis.''Removal of joint fluid (''joint aspiration'') is performed to rule out bacterial or fungal infection of the joint.''Ultimately, the diagnosis of plant thorn arthritis requires either detection of a piece of thorn within the joint by radiology testing or surgical removal of the thorn fragments and identification of the fragments microscopically in the laboratory. Sometimes tiny pieces of thorns can be visualized using ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'' scanning), high-resolution ''computerized tomography'' (HR-CAT scanning), or ''ultrasound'' imaging. Often, however, the residual thorn fragments are too small to be seen with these methods and are detected only when identified in tissue that is surgically removed from the joint.''The affected joint lining tissue (synovium) is examined in the pathology department using microscopes. The tissue forms a characteristic reaction, called a granulomatous reaction, within the synovium (granulomatous synovitis). The microscopic thorn fragments are easily identified using a polarized light microscope as they appear brilliantly shiny (birefringent) to the examining pathologist.' "
What is the treatment for plant thorn arthritis?,"'It is important to recognize that puncturing a joint with a foreign material, such as a plant thorn, can lead to bacterial infection (''septic arthritis'') or fungal infection (''fungal arthritis'') of the joint. This possibility can be excluded by removing joint fluid and culturing the fluid in the laboratory. While plant thorn arthritis is technically noninfectious, these two forms of ''infectious arthritis'' can occur from plant thorn puncture of a joint, with or without true plant thorn arthritis. These forms of arthritis require urgent antibiotic treatment.''For plant thorn arthritis, anti-inflammatory medications may quiet some of the inflammation. However, chronic arthritis eventually develops even long after the plant thorn injury because of the thorn fragments remaining in the joint. This arthritis persists until the fragments are removed with a surgical operation. Without surgical resection of the plant fragments, ''joint inflammation'' persists and permanent joint destruction can occur. There is no specific medication or home remedy for plant thorn arthritis.''The surgical operation that can cure plant thorn arthritis is called a synovectomy with joint lavage (joint washout cleaning). During a synovectomy, the surgeon will remove the affected and surrounding joint lining tissue (synovium) to be certain that microscopic joint fragments within the joint and its lining are eliminated from the body.'  "
What is the prognosis of plant thorn arthritis?,"'Once a synovectomy for plant thorn arthritis has been performed, the joint tends to heal well without residual problems. The sooner the synovectomy is performed, the better the outcome as chronic ''joint inflammation'' can risk damage to cartilage of the joint. Physical therapy rehabilitation exercises can be helpful to restore normal joint function.' "
Is it possible to prevent plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis can be prevented by avoiding exposure to the thorns of plants. It can help to wear protective clothing, gloves, etc., as well as being cautious when near or working with thorny plants.' "
What is plantar fasciitis?,"'The sole of the foot is referred to as the plantar area. Plantar fasciitis is a chronic local inflammation of the ""bowstring-like"" ligament stretching underneath the sole, also referred to as the plantar fascia, that attaches at the heel.' "
What causes plantar fasciitis?,"'Plantar fasciitis is most commonly caused by repetitive strain injury to the ligament of the sole of the foot. Such strain injury can be from excessive ''running'' or ''walking'', inadequate foot gear, and jumping injury from landing. Plantar fasciitis can also be caused by certain diseases, including ''reactive arthritis'' and ''ankylosing spondylitis''.' "
What are plantar fasciitis symptoms and signs?,"'Plantar fasciitis causes ''pain'' and tenderness of the bottom of the foot. The tenderness is usually toward the heel, but the entire sole of the foot can be affected. A sign of abnormal tension or tightness that can lead to plantar fasciitis is a bony prominence (heel spur) that develops where the inflamed plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone (calcaneus).''Plantar fasciitis can make ''walking'' and ''running'' difficult. It can make the foot feel particularly stiff and sensitive in the morning or when rising after sitting or getting out of a car. Plantar fasciitis makes it difficult to walk barefoot on hard surfaces. Sometimes the bottom of the foot can feel warm, swollen, and tender.'  "
What tests do physicians use to diagnose plantar fasciitis?,"'Plantar fasciitis is diagnosed based on the history of the condition as well as the physical examination. Plantar fasciitis will have localized tenderness along the sole of the foot, most commonly at the inside arch of the heel. Usually no further testing is necessary. X-ray testing can reveal an associated heel spur if present and rule out other causes of ''heel pain'', such as ''fractures'' or tumors. ''Ultrasound'' imaging can also be helpful in diagnosing plantar fasciitis.' "
What is the treatment for plantar fasciitis?,"'Plantar fasciitis is treated by measures that decrease the associated inflammation and avoid reinjury. Local ice ''massage'' applications both reduce ''pain'' and inflammation. Physical therapy methods, including stretching exercises, are used to treat and prevent plantar fasciitis. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or cortisone injections, are often helpful. Sports ''running'' shoes with soft, cushioned soles can be helpful in reducing irritation of inflamed tissues from plantar fasciitis. Custom orthotic shoe inserts are used to reduce the excess motion of the foot and decrease strain to the plantar fascia. Infrequently, surgery is performed on chronically inflamed plantar fascia (plantar fasciosis) if conservative treatments fail. Newer treatments for these cases such as cobaltion, PRP, prolotherapy, ESWT, and micro-debridement are utilized as well.'  "
What is the prognosis of plantar fasciitis?,"'The prognosis for plantar fasciitis is usually very good. Plantar fasciitis generally resolves with the conservative measures described above. However, in some cases, the condition can evolve into plantar fasciosis, which responds to a different set of treatments than those used for plantar fasciitis.' "
Is it possible to prevent plantar fasciitis?,"'Plantar fasciitis can only be prevented by treating any underlying associated inflammatory disease and wearing optimal footwear, orthotic shoe inserts, and stretching.' "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
What is malaria?,"'Malaria is a serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal, disease spread by mosquitoes and caused by a parasite. Malaria was a significant health risk in the U.S. until it was eliminated by multiple disease-control programs in the late 1940s. The illness presents with ''flu-like symptoms'' that include high ''fever'' and ''chills''.''There are three necessary aspects to the malaria life cycle:' The Anopheles mosquito carries the parasite and is where the parasite starts its life cycle. The parasite (Plasmodium) has multiple subspecies, each causing a different severity of symptoms and responding to different treatments. The parasite first travels to a human's liver to grow and multiply. It then travels in the bloodstream and infects and destroys red blood cells."
Is malaria contagious?,"'Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease and that does not spread from person to person (except in ''pregnancy'' as noted below) but spreads in certain circumstances without a mosquito. This occurs rarely and is usually found in a transmission from a ''pregnant'' woman to an unborn child (congenital malaria), by blood transfusions, or when intravenous-drug users share needles. Except for the above conditions, malaria is not considered ''contagious'' person to person.' "
What is the incubation period for malaria?,"'Following the mosquito bite, there is about a seven- to 30-day period before symptoms appear (incubation period). The incubation period for ''P. vivax'' is usually 10-17 days but can be much longer (about one year and rarely, as long as 30 years!). ''P. falciparum'' usually has a short incubation period (10-14 days). Other species of ''Plasmodium'' that cause malaria have incubation periods similar to ''P. vivax''.' "
What causes malaria? What are the types of malaria?,"'Parasites of the genus ''Plasmodium'' cause malaria. Although there are many species of the malaria parasite ''Plasmodium'', only five infect humans and cause malaria.''Plasmodium falciparum'': found in tropical and subtropical areas; major contributor to deaths from severe malaria''P. vivax'': found in Asia and Latin America; has a dormant stage that can cause relapses''P. ovale'': found in Africa and the Pacific islands''P. malariae'': worldwide; can cause a chronic infection''P. knowlesi'': found throughout Southeast Asia; can rapidly progress from an uncomplicated case to a severe malaria infection'  "
What are malaria symptoms and signs?,"'Malaria has a wide spectrum of symptoms. After the bite by the infected mosquito occurs, it can take between seven and 30 days (average is seven to 15 days) before symptoms start (incubation period).''Health care professionals classify malaria as uncomplicated or complicated (severe).''The most common symptoms are''The classic description of a malaria attack (which is rarely observed), would be a six- to 12-hour period of ''cold'' and shivering alternating with fever and ''headaches'' and then a stage of ''sweating'' and ''tiredness'' (sometimes divided into the cold and hot stage).''As these symptoms are very nonspecific, it is important to evaluate if the patient has risk factors for malaria (usual travel in endemic areas).''This occurs when malaria affects different body systems.'

   fever and chills, headaches, nausea and vomiting, and general weakness and body aches. Severe anemia (due to destruction of red blood cells) Kidney failure Cerebral malaria -- seizures, unconsciousness, abnormal behavior, or confusion Cardiovascular collapse Low blood sugar (in pregnant women after treatment with quinine)"
What specialists treat malaria?,"'Malaria can be treated by your primary care doctor (pediatrician, family medicine, internal medicine), as well as by infectious-disease specialists.' "
How do physicians diagnose malaria?,"'The ''symptoms of malaria'' can mimic many other diseases, including ''influenza'' or a viral syndrome. It is therefore important to inquire about a history of recent travel to an endemic area or other possible exposures.'""Physicians make a definite diagnosis of malaria by looking at the blood of an infected patient under the microscope (blood smear) and identifying the presence of the parasite. The patients' blood is prepared under a slide with a specific stain to help identify the parasite. This is the most widely performed and accepted test.""'Rapid diagnostic tests (antigen tests) are available that can give the diagnosis in a few minutes. It is recommended that a blood smear examination follows a positive test.' "
What is the treatment for malaria?,"'Besides supportive care, the medical team needs to decide on the appropriate antimalarial drug(s) to treat malaria. The choice will depend on several factors, including''Physicians will administer the medication in pill form or as an intravenous antimalarial depending on above factors.''The most commonly used medications are'  the specific species of parasite identified, the severity of symptoms, and determination of drug resistance based on the geographic area where the patient traveled. chloroquine (Aralen), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox), quinine (Qualaquin), mefloquine (Lariam), atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), and primaquine phosphate (Primaquine)."
Can malaria reoccur after treatment?,"'P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' can hibernate in the liver and cause relapsing disease weeks or months after the patient is symptom free.''The FDA approved tafenoquine (Krintafel) as a medication to prevent relapses of ''Plasmodium vivax'' in patients 16 years of age and older. It is a single-dose medication that will provide a significant new tool in fighting ''P. vivax'' malaria relapse, according to researchers.' "
What is the prognosis of malaria?,"'If diagnosed early and if the appropriate antimalarials are available and used, the prognosis of malaria is very good.''Worldwide, malaria is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. The majority of victims are young children from sub-Saharan Africa. Death is usually due to lack of available treatment or access to treatment.''P. falciparum'' tends to be the species causing the most complications and has a high mortality if untreated.''Cerebral malaria, a complication of ''P. falciparum'' malaria, has a 20% mortality rate even if treated.' "
Is there a malaria vaccine?,"'There is currently no commercial ''vaccine'' available to prevent malaria. Due to the diversity of the ''Plasmodium'' species and the ''P. falciparum'' species being the deadliest parasite, most efforts are currently directed toward a ''P. falciparum'' vaccine. RTS,S/ASO1 is the most advanced candidate as a viable vaccine.''A phase 3 trial of RTS,S/ASO1 was completed and results published in 2015. The WHO is supporting the pilot implementation in several sub-Saharan countries.' "
How can people prevent malaria?,"'The prevention of malaria includes several steps.''First, evaluate if malaria is a concern in the area of travel (''CDC malaria information by country table''). This table will also indicate which medication to take as ''chemo''-prophylaxis.''If chemo-prophylaxis is recommended, discuss the recommended medications with a health care professional to determine if they are appropriate. Take into consideration any medical conditions, ''drug interactions'' with current medication taken on a continual basis, as well as side effects of the recommended medications.''No medication is 100% effective, and therefore the prevention of mosquito bites is of paramount importance. These preventive measures should include the following:' Sleeping under bed nets: These should cover all of the bed down to the floor. These nets are most effective when treated with an insecticide. Clothing: Clothing that covers most of the exposed skin and shoes that are closed can reduce the risk of bites. Tuck in all clothing, and pants should be tucked into socks to avoid exposure around the ankles. In addition, treating clothes with insecticides can prevent bites even further. Apply insect repellent to all exposed skin."

Introduction,"'Collagen injections give your skin a plumper, smoother appearance. Although collagen is the best known filler, there are many other substances doctors can use to plump up your skin, including fat from your own body and synthetic materials. Below you will find a detailed explanation of how collagen works, followed by a list of other injectable fillers your doctor may recommend.' "
Collagen,"' To understand collagen, you should first understand your skin.''Skin consists of three layers: the ''epidermis'', dermis, and subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis). The upper-most layer, known as the epidermis, controls the ''loss of water'' from cells and tissue. Without this protective barrier, the body would quickly dehydrate.''Just below the epidermis lies the second layer, the dermis. The dermis, although it contains blood vessels, nerves and hair follicles, is primarily made up of a protein called ""collagen."" This protein forms a network of fibers that provides a framework for the growth of cells and blood vessels. Because it is the primary component of the dermis, collagen acts as the support structure for the skin. The hypodermis is a layer of fat and connective tissue that contains larger blood vessels and nerves. It also hosts sweat glands, fat, and collagen cells. The hypodermis is responsible for conserving your body\'s heat and protecting your vital inner organs.' "
Why Do Lines Appear on Skin?,""" In young skin, the collagen framework is intact and the skin remains moisturized and elastic. It's resilient to the many facial expressions we adopt as well as everyday environmental exposure. But, over time, the support structure weakens and the skin loses its elasticity. The skin begins to lose its tone as the collagen support wears down. Every time you smile, frown or squint, you put ""'stress'' on the collagen in your skin. The effect of these facial expressions is cumulative and facial lines begin to appear. ' "
How Do Collagen Injections Work?,""" Collagen injections replenish the skin's natural collagen. The natural ""'beauty'' of your skin is enhanced as the contour of  the support structure is restored.'' Zyderm and Zyplast are collagen products gotten from cows that replace the collagen your skin  loses over time. Zyderm and Zyplast collagen are placed just beneath the skin, in the dermis where the body readily accepts it  as its own.'' CosmoDerm and CosmoPlast are bioengineered human collagen products that are used for similar indications as Zyderm  and Zyplast but have the advantage of not requiring a skin test prior to the first treatment.'' Collagen should be injected into your skin only by a trained health care \tprofessional.' "
Other Injectable Fillers," Artecoll is a synthetic filler material. Because it's synthetic, you are at higher risk of having an 
	allergic reaction 
  to it than if you got an injection of collagen or fat, but it lasts much longer than those options. Autologen is an injection of your own collagen, extracted from another place on your body. There's no risk of allergic 
  reaction; however, the results are only temporary. Dermalogen is collagen extracted from deceased human donors. This is 
  also a temporary fix, but your body should not reject it. Fascia injections use a specific type of connective tissue harvested either from your own body or from a deceased human donor. It can be implanted surgically or injected. The main drawback is that within a year of injection, your body will reabsorb the fascia and you'll be back at square one.  Fat from your own thighs or abdomen can be also be injected. There's no risk of allergic reaction and you may achieve 
  permanent results. This can also be implanted surgically. HylaForm is a material created from a natural body substance known as hyaluronic acid. There's no risk of infection, but you will need repeated treatments to maintain the result as it's only a temporary fix. Restylane is a clear gel that also contains hyaluronic acid. It is only a temporary fix, as your body will absorb it within about six months of the injection."
"What Can I Expect From Collagen Injections or Other 
	Fillers?","'Before getting a ''collagen injection'', you should expect to receive a small injection of local anesthesia to numb the area being treated. There is a possibility of slight \t''bruising'', and you may experience puffiness, redness, and tenderness around the treated site.'""It's important to discuss with your doctor exactly what you can expect from each treatment. Together, you can prioritize which facial areas you wish to be treated and discuss how many treatments you may need and the estimated cost. It's important to know that one treatment may not remove every line on your face.""' Depending on the substance injected, you may need continued treatments to maintain the smoothing effect.' "
How Many Collagen or Filler Injections Will I Need?,"'  That depends on which product you use. Just like natural collagen, collagen replacements begin to lose form and will eventually wear down. Treatment may require collagen injections two to four times a year to maintain the smoothing effects. Hylaform and \tRestylane are also eventually reabsorbed by the body requiring repeated treatment. Synthetic materials, such as Artecoll, last longer but carry a higher risk of allergic reaction. Fat, depending on how it is used, can sometimes achieve permanent results.' "
How Do I Find Out if Injections Are Right for Me?,"'  You and your doctor will discuss your medical history and the areas you want treated with injectable fillers. Injections are not appropriate for certain lines and ''scars'' or when certain medical conditions are present. It is very important to discuss and understand what filler injections can do for you.'' If you and your doctor decide injections are appropriate, your doctor may start with a skin test in your forearm to   determine if you are sensitive to the substance being used. You must watch the area very carefully over a four-week   period. Most men and women tested show no reaction to the skin test and can have injections.' "
Why Aren't Creams Containing Collagen Enough to Smooth Out Lines?,'Collagen creams work only on the skin surface. A moisturizer with or without collagen cannot penetrate the skin and is not designed to be absorbed. No moisturizer can undo the cumulative effect of collagen loss. Creams primarily slow the rate of water loss from the skin and help keep the skin supple.''WebMD Medical Reference' 
How a Neck Lift Is Done,"'Typically, the procedure will last two to three hours. Of course, if you are having a neck lift in conjunction with liposuction, ''facelift'', brow lift, or other surgeries, the time will vary accordingly. Your exact procedure will depend on your desired results and your own personal circumstances. In order to undergo a neck lift, you must be in good general health, both physically and mentally. '""What do you dislike about your neck? Be honest with yourself! You're putting a lot of time and effort into researching the surgery, so make sure you get the results you want. You also should write down your thoughts on what you'd like to correct and have that with you at the time of your pre-operative consultation.""'Here are some of the most common concerns:' Turkey wattle neck Excess fat Too much skin"
Turkey Wattle; Weakened or Loose Neck Muscles,"'If you have weakened or loose neck muscles, this may cause the ""turkey wattle"" or appearance of neck ""bands."" ''To correct this, your surgeon may recommend platysmaplasty surgery. The surgeon makes incisions under your chin and/or behind your ears to access the platysma (neck muscle) and manipulate it accordingly. Sometimes, that may even mean removing some muscle. Your surgeon may also use permanent ''sutures'' to hold the tissue in place. ''There are new less invasive procedures, where your surgeon may be able to make smaller incisions and use an endoscope (small camera attached to a thin tube) to complete your surgery. Make sure you ask your surgeon for all your options during your consultation. '""You and your surgeon will discuss what type of anesthesia to use, depending on your level of comfort. If you want to remain asleep during the procedure, you should request general anesthesia. Otherwise, your surgeon can use local anesthesia with sedation. It's up to you, however, to make that determination.""'Instead of surgery or in addition to it, ''Botox'' injections can relax parts of the platysma that are responsible for the ""band"" appearance or look of fullness. The injections are completed on an outpatient basis and typically can be completed within 15 minutes.'  "
Excess fat in the neck area,"'During liposuction, your surgeon will make a small incision below the chin and remove the excess fat. If you are undergoing multiple procedures during your neck lift, it is very common for ''plastic'"" surgeons to begin with liposuction.If this is the only procedure you'll need, you should plan to spend up to an hour undergoing the operation. """"You will be able to determine this with your doctor during your pre-operative consultation. Your incisions will be stitched and bandaged. It's very important to follow your doctor's instructions on properly caring for the ""'stitches'' and bandage in the days following surgery. ' "
Too much skin in the neck area,"'Just like the platysmaplasty, your surgeon will make similar incisions for a cervicoplasty, trimming parts of the skin and lifting it into place. ''It will be secured with tissue glue or stitches. The cervicoplasty can be completed in about two to four hours, depending on the complexity of your procedure. Again, your anesthesia will depend on your own personal comfort level. '""Your surgeon will fit you with a compression bandage that you will have to wear for at least one week, unless instructed otherwise. It's important to follow his or her instructions to ensure proper recovery. "" "
How should I prepare for a neck lift?,"'During your consultation, your surgeon will instruct you on what medications to avoid prior to your surgery. Certain medications and ''vitamins'' thin your blood and can cause increased bleeding. ''If you are a smoker, you will need to quit at least two weeks before the surgery and two weeks after. You cannot just plan to cut down. You must not smoke for this time period to ensure proper healing. ''Also, this is no time for a ''diet'': make sure that you eat properly because this will help your body heal. ''Make sure you wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of surgery. You should especially plan to wear a button-down blouse or shirt that does not have to be pulled over your neck or head. ''You should plan to take at least one week off from work to recover. However, your doctor can determine this based on your personal situation. '""If you are having platysmaplasty, cervicoplasty, or a combination of any of the procedures we've discussed here, you should plan on having a home recovery area set up before you undergo surgery."" Ice packs Gauze and towels Thermometer Supply of comfortable, loose clothing (preferably button down shirts or blouses that do not have to be pulled over your neck and head) Petroleum jelly and antibacterial ointment for incision sites Telephone within reaching distance of where you'll be lying or sitting most of the time Supply of pillows which will allow you to keep your head in a comfortable position Someone who can stay with you at least the first 24 hours after surgery"
What is the expected recovery from a neck lift?,"""Recovery takes time and it's important that you're patient with the process. Most people can return to work in 10-14 days. """"If you participate in other sports or are physically active, you will have to wait at least three weeks, if not longer, to resume those activities. Don't rush! It's not worth it. You've put a lot of time and energy into making this happen, so make it worthwhile."" "
What are the complications and side effects of neck lift surgery?,"'You will have swelling and ''bruising'' that can last for several days. You may feel tightness or tingling, and different sensations including burning or pulling. You also will experience numbness. These are all very normal in the first few weeks following surgery and should not be cause for concern. ''As with any surgery, you run the risk of infection. Please keep a watchful eye on your temperature. At the first sign of a ''fever'', contact your doctor. If you have unusual discharge from the incision site, such as pus, contact your doctor immediately. '""Although it's very rare, you could have an ""'allergic reaction'"" to the anesthesia. That's why it's very important to disclose any drug ""'allergies'' to your doctor in a pre-operative consultation.'  "
Does insurance cover this procedure?,"'Insurance carriers are all different, but one thing is the same: They typically agree NOT to cover elective, ''cosmetic surgery''. '""If your procedures will in any way correct a medical condition, it's important that you express this to your insurance carrier. Your surgeon can write a letter detailing your case.""""Also, it's important to realize that cosmetic or ""'plastic surgery'' can affect future coverage under certain insurance carriers. It can also affect your premiums.

What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What is thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'Thrombocytopenia is lower than a normal number of platelets (less than 150,000 platelets per microliter) in the blood. Normal platelet counts range from 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter in the blood.''Platelets are one of the cellular components of the blood along with white and ''red blood cells''. Platelets play an important role in clotting and bleeding. Platelets are made in the bone marrow similar to other cells in the blood. Platelets originate from megakaryocytes, which are large cells found in the bone marrow. The fragments of these megakaryocytes are platelets that are released into the bloodstream. The circulating platelets make up about two-thirds of the platelets that are released from the bone marrow. The other third is typically stored (sequestered) in the spleen.''Platelets, in general, have a brief lifespan in the blood (7 to 10 days), after which they are removed from circulation. The number of platelets in the blood is referred to as the platelet count and is normally between 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter) of blood. Platelet counts less than 150,000 are termed thrombocytopenia. A platelet count greater than 400,000 is called thrombocytosis.''Platelets participate in coagulation. Platelets initiate a sequence of reactions that eventually lead to the formation of a ''blood clot''. They circulate in the blood vessels and become activated if there is any bleeding or injury in the body. Certain chemicals are released from the injured blood vessels or other structures that signal platelets to become activated and join the other components of the system to initiate coagulation. When activated, the platelets become sticky and adhere to one another and to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury to slow down and stop the bleeding by plugging up the damaged blood vessel or tissue (hemostasis).''It is important to note that even though the platelet numbers are decreased in thrombocytopenia, their function often remains completely intact. Other disorders exist that can cause impaired platelet function despite normal platelet count.''A platelet count below 10,000 is severe thrombocytopenia and may result in spontaneous bleeding. In mild thrombocytopenia, there may be no adverse effects in the clotting or bleeding pathways. These effects vary with different low platelet counts from person to person.' "
What are the symptoms of thrombocytopenia?,"'In many instances, thrombocytopenia may have no symptoms, especially if mild, and it can be detected only incidentally on routine blood work done for other reasons. However, the symptoms and signs of thrombocytopenia may include:'   Superficial bleeding into 
the skin resulting in small reddish spots (petechiae) Fatigue Easy or excessive bruising (purpura) Prolonged bleeding cuts Spontaneous bleeding from the gums or 
nose Jaundice Heavy menstrual bleeding that's unusual 
for the individual Blood in the urine or stools Enlarged spleen Bleeding that will not stop DVT (deep vein thrombosis)"
What causes thrombocytopenia?,"'Low platelet counts or thrombocytopenia, can be caused by a variety of reasons. In general, they can be divided into:''Some of the most common and important causes of thrombocytopenia are outlined below. '   decreased platelet production,  increased platelet destruction or consumption, or  increased splenic sequestration (capturing of circulating platelets in the spleen). "
Decreased platelet production,"'Decreased platelet production is usually related to a bone marrow problem. In some of these conditions, red blood cell and white blood cell productions may also be affected.' Viral infections affecting the marrow for exampleparvovirus,rubella,mumps,chickenpox (varicella),hepatitis C,Epstein-Barr virus, andHIV. parvovirus, rubella, mumps, chickenpox (varicella), hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV. Aplastic anemia is a general term used when the bone marrow fails to produce any blood cells (red cells, white cells, and platelets), also called pancytopenia. This can be caused by some viral infections (parvovirus or HIV), medications (gold, chloramphenicol, phenytoin [Dilantin], valproate [Depakote]), or radiation, or rarely, it can be congenital (Fanconi's anemia). Chemotherapy drugs frequently cause bone marrow suppression resulting in thrombocytopenia. Some drugs other than chemotherapy can suppress platelet production, such as thiazide diuretics. Cancers of the bone marrow and blood (leukemia) or cancers of the lymph nodes (lymphoma) can cause various degrees of thrombocytopenia. Cancers from other organs can sometimes infiltrate (invade) the bone marrow and result in impaired production of platelets. Long term alcohol can cause direct toxicity of the bone marrow. Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid can result in low platelet production by the bone marrow."
Increased platelet destruction or consumption,"'Increased platelet destruction or consumption can be seen in a number of medical conditions. They can be divided into immune related and non-immune related causes.''Many medications can cause low platelet count by causing immunologic reaction against platelets, called drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Some examples may include:' sulfonamide antibiotics,carbamazepine [(Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol) anti-seizure drug],digoxin (Lanoxin),quinine (Quinerva, Quinite, QM-260),quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex),acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), andrifampin. carbamazepine [(Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol) anti-seizure drug], digoxin (Lanoxin), quinine (Quinerva, Quinite, QM-260), quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), and rifampin. Heparin, a commonly used blood thinner, and similar medications [low molecular weight heparins like enoxaparin (Lovenox) can occasionally induce an immune response against platelets resulting in rapid and severe destruction of platelets. This condition is termed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or HIT. HIT develops about 1 to 2 days in HIT type 1 and is a non-immune disorder that occurs because of the direct effect of heparin platelet activation. However, HIT type 2 is an immune mediated disorder that occurs about 4 to10 days after exposure to heparin and can develop into life- and limb-threatening complications. HIT is usually not marked by bleeding problems, but by DVT and pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and supported by laboratory findings such as 30% drop platelet count acute thrombotic event like DVT, presence of heparin-PF4 antibodies and the resolution of thrombocytopenia after stopping heparin. Guidelines for treating HIT are too detailed to cover in this article, but can be found in reference 2. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a condition where the immune system attacks platelets. In severe conditions, ITP can result in very low platelet counts. In adults, this is often a chronic (long standing) condition, whereas, in children, it can be caused acutely after a viral infection. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes need to be ruled out. Some rheumatologic conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune conditions (connective tissue diseases), can cause platelet destruction. Transfusion of blood products and organ transplantation can sometimes cause immunologic disturbances resulting in thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are related conditions that can cause non-immune consumptive thrombocytopenia resulting from some infection bacteria in the blood), pregnancy, some metastatic cancers, or chemotherapy. Other manifestations of these conditions include kidney insufficiency, confusion, anemia (hemolytic), and fever. Classic HUS is largely seen in children and is generally thought of as an aftermath of an infection with a certain strain of  Escherichia coli bacteria (E. coli O157:H7) which causes infectious diarrhea. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver tests, low platelets) is another non-immune thrombocytopenia that may occur during pregnancy and can include elevation of liver enzymes and anemia (specifically, hemolytic anemia or rupturing of red blood cells). Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a rare but severe condition that may be a complication of overwhelming infections, traumas, burns, or pregnancy. Injury to or inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and, sometimes, artificial heart valves can cause increased destruction of platelets. Severe infections (sepsis) or trauma can sometimes cause consumptive thrombocytopenia (without DIC)."
Splenic sequestration,"'Splenic sequestration can also lead to low platelet counts as a result of enlargement or change in function of the spleen for a variety of reasons. When the spleen enlarges, it can retain (sequester) more than the usual amount of platelets. Common causes of thrombocytopenia due to splenic enlargement may include advanced ''liver disease'' with ''portal hypertension'' (''cirrhosis'', for example, from chronic ''hepatitis B'' or C) and blood cancers (leukemias or ''lymphomas'').' Dilutional thrombocytopenia can result from severe bleeding and transfusion of several units transfused red blood cells in a short time. Pseudothrombocytopenia (false thrombocytopenia) is a commonly encountered condition where the number of platelets seen on a complete blood count analysis (CBC) may falsely appear low because of the clumping of platelets together. This can lead to an artificially reduced automated count. If this is suspected, the blood can be redrawn in a tube with a material that prevents clumping of platelets for repeat analysis. A peripheral smear review will identify platelet clumping. Thrombocytopenia can also be present at birth, called neonatal thrombocytopenia. Most of these cases can be caused by processes similar to those above, although, they are occasionally related to rare genetic conditions."
When should I seek medical care for thrombocytopenia?,"'If thrombocytopenia is detected on a routine blood work, it is generally addressed and investigated by the physician who orders the test. In people with known thrombocytopenia, follow-up care is decided based on the diagnosis and the severity. However, if a person has one or more of the above listed symptoms, they should seek a health-care professional as thrombocytopenia may quickly worsen and become serious in some individuals.''People with thrombocytopenia are, in general, initially cared for by an internist or a family practice physician. Sometimes, consultation with a doctor who specializes in ''blood disorders'' (hematologist) is helpful for more thorough investigation or treatment, but others may require additional help.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat thrombycytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'Although some primary care doctors and pediatricians can treat thrombocytopenia, other specialists such as emergency medicine, hematologists, internal medicine, critical care and immunologists may be needed to treat and diagnose the problem or its underlying cause.' "
How is thrombocytopenia diagnosed?,"'Thrombocytopenia is usually detected incidentally from routine blood work done for other reasons. Platelets are a component of the complete blood count (CBC) which also contains information on red blood cells and white blood cells.''If thrombocytopenia is seen for the first time, it is prudent to repeat the complete blood count in order to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia (see above). If the repeat CBC confirms low platelet counts, then further evaluation can begin.''Once detected, the cause of thrombocytopenia may be investigated by the doctor. The most essential part of this evaluation includes a thorough physical examination and medical history of the patient. In the medical history, the complete list of all medications is routinely reviewed. Some of the other important components of the history include reviewing previous known history of low platelet count, family history of thrombocytopenia, recent infections, any previous cancers, other autoimmune disorders, or ''liver disease''.''A review of the symptoms related to excessive bleeding or bruising can also provide additional information. As a part of a thorough physical examination, special attention may be given to the skin and ''mucus'' membrane in the oral ''cavity'' for petechiae or purpura or other signs of bleeding. On the abdominal examination, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) can provide important diagnostic clues.''The urgency to perform additional testing and evaluation is largely dependent on how low the platelet count is on the blood count, and what the clinical situation may be. For instance, in a person who needs a surgery and has a platelet count of less than 50,000, the investigation will take precedence over one whose thrombocytopenia was detected on a yearly blood work with a platelet of 100,000.''A comprehensive review of the other components of the CBC is one of the most important steps in the evaluation of low platelet count. The CBC can tell us whether other blood disorders may be present, such as, anemia (low ''red cell count'' or ''hemoglobin''), erythrocytosis (''high red blood cell count'' or hemoglobin), leukopenia (low white cells count), or leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count). These abnormalities may suggest bone marrow problems as the potential cause of thrombocytopenia. Abnormally shaped or ruptured red cells (schistocytes) seen on the blood smear may suggest evidence of HELLP, TTP, or HUS (see above).''Another clue in the CBC is the mean platelet volume or MPV, which is an estimate of the average size of platelets in the blood. A low MPV number may suggest a platelet production problem, whereas, a high number may indicate increased destruction.''It is important to also review other blood work including the complete metabolic panel, coagulation panel, and ''urinalysis''. Certain abnormalities in these tests can suggest advanced ''liver'' disease (''cirrhosis''), kidney problems (''renal failure''), or other pertinent underlying medical conditions.''In some causes of thrombocytopenia, such as HIT or ITP, additional testing with antibodies may be useful. ''Bone marrow biopsy'' may sometimes be performed if a bone marrow problem is suspected.'  "
What is the treatment for thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'The treatment of thrombocytopenia is largely dependent upon the cause and the severity of the condition.''Some situations may require specific or emergent treatments, whereas, others need only be managed by occasional blood draws and monitoring of the platelet levels.''In auto-immune thrombocytopenia or ITP, steroids can be used to suppress the immune system in order to impair the destruction of platelets. In more severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or monoclonal antibodies may also be given to alter the immune process. In refractory cases, splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be necessary.''If a drug is thought to be the cause of a low platelet count, then it may be discontinued by the supervising physician. In patients with HIT, it is very important to remove and limit the future use of any heparin products, including low molecular weight heparin (like Lovenox), immediately to prevent further immune response against the platelets.''If TTP or HUS is diagnosed, the treatment may include plasma exchange, plasmapheresis, or eculizumab. In cases with severe ''kidney failure'', ''dialysis'' may be necessary.''In general, platelet transfusion is not necessary, unless an individual with low platelets (less than 50,000) has an active bleeding or hemorrhage, or needs a surgery or other invasive procedures. Frequently, a platelet transfusion may be recommended without any bleeding if the count is less than 10,000.''In suspected cases of HIT or TTP, transfusion of platelets may not be recommended because the new platelets could potentially make the condition worse and more prolonged.'  "
What are the complications of thrombocytopenia?,"'The complications of thrombocytopenia may be excessive bleeding after a cut or an injury resulting in hemorrhage and major blood loss. However, spontaneous bleeding (without any injury or laceration) due to thrombocytopenia is uncommon, unless the platelet count is less than 10,000.''Other complications may be related to any other underlying factors or conditions. For example, autoimmune thrombocytopenia related to ''lupus'' may be associated with other complications of ''lupus''. TTP or HUS can have many complications including severe anemia, confusion or other neurologic changes, or ''kidney failure''. HIT or heparin induced thrombocytopenia can have devastating complications related to ''blood clot'' formation (thrombosis). The mortality rate for HIT is about 20% to 30%, according to a 2016 study.' "
Can thrombocytopenia be prevented?,"'In general, thrombocytopenia can be prevented if the cause is known and it is preventable. For example, if a certain medication is found to induce a low platelet count in an individual, then its future use needs to be avoided. Alcohol avoidance should be encouraged in people with known alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia. Current and future use of all heparin products must be avoided in people diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'The prognosis for someone with thrombocytopenia depends on the cause and the severity of the disease. Generally, when thrombocytopenia is diagnosed early, the outcomes are very good. However, delayed diagnosis can result in problems ranging from ''heart attack'', organ damage (for examples, spleen, bowel, kidney) to ''pulmonary embolism'', each of which has a more guarded prognosis. HIT, as previously mentioned, is serious and still has a mortality rate.' "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis.

How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant.

What is pleural effusion?,"'''A ''pleural effusion'' is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, an area between the layers of tissue that line the ''lungs'' and the chest wall. It may also be referred to as effusion or pulmonary effusion. The type of fluid that forms a ''pleural effusion'' may be categorized as either ''transudate'' or ''exudate''.' Transudate is usually composed of ultrafiltrates of plasma due to an imbalance in vascular hydrostatic and oncotic forces in the chest (heart failure, cirrhosis). Exudate is typically produced by inflammatory conditions (lung infection, lung cancer). Exudative pleural effusions are usually more serious and difficult to treat."
What causes pleural effusion?,"'There are many causes of pleural effusions. The following is a list of some of the major causes:''The development of a pleural effusion occurs from fluid seeping into the pleural space, a thin area between the visceral and pleural membranes in the chest ''cavity'', which normally contains a small amount of fluid to facilitate smooth lung movement. Fluid under pressure, ''malignant'' cells, and infectious agents can occasionally enter the pleural ''cavity'' and cause it to expand with abnormal amounts of fluid and other compounds (see diagnosis section).'   Congestive heart failure Kidney failure Infection Malignancy Pulmonary embolism Hypoalbuminemia Cirrhosis Lung cancer Trauma"
What are the risk factors for pleural effusion?,"'Pleural effusions are caused by the underlying medical problems listed previously, therefore the presence of any of these medical problems are risk factors for the development of pleural effusions. It is important to note, however, that not all individuals with these medical problems will develop pleural effusions. ''Congestive heart failure'' is the most common cause of ''transudative ''pleural effusions, while infection (''pneumonia'') and malignancy are the most common causes of ''exudative ''pleural effusions.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of pleural effusion?,"'Common symptoms associated with pleural effusion may include the following:''Deep breathing typically increases the ''pain''. Symptoms of ''fever'', ''chills'', and ''loss of appetite'' often accompany pleural effusions caused by infectious agents.'   chest pain, difficulty breathing, painful breathing (pleurisy), and cough (either a dry cough or a productive cough)."
What procedures and tests diagnose pleural effusions?,"""The patient's history and physical exam may indicate a presumptive diagnose of pleural effusion. For example, a patient with a history of congestive ""'heart failure'' or ''cirrhosis'' with symptoms of ''cough'', difficulty breathing, and pleuritic ''chest pain'' may have a pleural effusion. Findings from the physical exam, such as dullness to percussion of the lung area (when tapping the area of the lung with a finger, the percussion or sound is dull -- if no fluid exists in the area the sound will be lighter), decreased vibration (decreased tactile fremitus), and asymmetrical chest expansion (the ''lungs'' do not inflate or deflate equally) may also be evidence of a pleural effusion. Other physical exam findings detected with a stethoscope may include reduced or inaudible breath sounds on the affected side, egophony (patient voices the letter ""e,"" but when listening [auscultation] it sounds like ""a""), and a friction rub (if there is fluid in the pleural area, the ''heart'' will rub against the inflamed or fluid-filled space).''Chest X-ray'' can detect pleural effusions, as they usually appear as whitish areas at the lung base, and they may occur on only one side (unilateral) or on both sides (bilateral). If a person lies on their side for a few minutes, most pleural effusions will move and layer out along that side of the chest cavity which is positioned downward (because of the effects of gravity). This movement of the pleural effusion can be seen on a ''chest X-ray'' taken with the person lying on their side (a lateral decubitus X-ray).''Other imaging tests, such as ''CT scan'', may be ordered to further identify the possible cause and the extent of the pleural effusion.''Diagnosing the cause(s) of a pleural effusion often begins with determining whether the fluid is transudate or exudate. This is important because the results of this fluid analysis may provide a diagnosis and determine the course of treatment. Thoracentesis (a procedure to remove the fluid from the pleural space) followed by laboratory analysis of the fluid can differentiate between transudate and exudate. The results from the fluid obtained from the thoracentesis are compared to certain blood tests (for example, LDH, glucose, protein, pH, ''cholesterol'' and others). Additional testing of the pleural fluid may also include a cell count, cytology, and cultures. Criteria are then used to differentiate exudate from transudate. Exudative effusions have the following characteristics:''Other health care professionals may use different criteria to determine the presence of exudate, such as the ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein levels > 0.5, LDH ratio > 0.6 and LDH ratio > 2/3 the upper limits of normal. Other pleural fluid analysis test results (cytology or amylase, for example) may also reveal the source of the effusion.' Pleural fluid LDH > 0.45 of the upper limits of normal blood values Pleural fluid protein level > 2.9g/dL Pleural fluid cholesterol level > 45mg/dL"
What is the treatment for pleural effusion?,"'Small transudative effusions may require no treatment, while larger ones and most exudative pleural effusions require treatment. The initial treatment of choice is drainage of the pleural fluid. This is done by thoracentesis (this procedure may be both diagnostic and therapeutic), where a chest tube is inserted into the effusion, and the effusion is drained out. This procedure needs monitoring, and in some instances, the tube may need to remain in the pleural space for a longer period of time for continued drainage. The need for repeated thoracentesis varies from patient to patient depending on the underlying cause, the amount of effusion fluid, the type of effusion (thick, thin, ''malignant'', or infectious, for example) and if there is recurrence of the pleural effusion.''Some pleural effusions (mainly exudative) may require surgery to break up adhesions, while others may require pleurodesis (pleural sclerosis), a procedure whereby different irritant substances or medications are inserted into the pleural space in order to fibrose and ''scar'' the visceral and pleural surfaces together. This procedure seals the pleural space so that pleural effusions have difficulty reaccumulating.''The use of medications for pleural effusions depends on the underlying cause. Antibiotics are used when there is an infectious cause, whereby diuretics such as ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') may be used to slowly help reduce the size of the pleural effusion.'  "
What are the complications of pleural effusion?,"'The potential complications associated with pleural effusion are:'   lung scarring, pneumothorax (collapse of the lung) as a complication of thoracentesis, empyema (a collection of pus within the pleural space), and sepsis (blood infection) sometimes leading to death."
Can you prevent a pleural effusion?," The development of pleural effusions may sometimes be prevented by the early treatment of the underlying causes listed above. However, in certain cases, the development of pleural effusions may not be preventable. Some pleural effusions may be prevented from reoccurring by having individuals undergo pleurodesis, a procedure that seals up the pleural space."
What is pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy describes the ''chest pain'' syndrome characterized by a sharp chest cavity ''pain'' that worsens with breathing.''Pleurisy is caused by inflammation of the linings around the lungs  (the pleura), a condition also known as pleuritis. There are two layers of pleura: one covering the lung (termed the visceral pleura) and the other covering the inner wall of the chest (the parietal pleura). These two layers are lubricated by pleural fluid.''Pleurisy is frequently associated with the accumulation of extra fluid in the space between the two layers of pleura. This fluid is referred to as a pleural effusion. ''The pain fibers of the lung are located in the pleura. When this tissue becomes inflamed, it results in a sharp pain in the chest that is worse with breathing. Other symptoms of pleurisy can include  ''cough'', chest tenderness, and  shortness of breath. ' "
What causes pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy can be caused by any of the following conditions:'   Infections: bacterial   (including those that cause tuberculosis), fungi, parasites, or   viruses  Inhaled chemicals or toxic substances: exposure to some cleaning agents like ammonia   Collagen vascular diseases: lupus,    rheumatoid arthritis  Cancers: for example, the   spread of lung cancer or breast cancer   to the pleura   Tumors of the pleura: mesothelioma or sarcoma  Congestion: heart failure  Pulmonary embolism:  blood   clot inside the blood vessels to the lungs. These clots sometimes severely   reduce blood and oxygen to portions of  the lung and can result in death to that portion of lung tissue (termed lung infarction). This, too, can cause   pleurisy.   Obstruction of lymph   channels: as a result of centrally located lung tumors   Trauma: rib fractures or   irritation from chest tubes used to drain air or fluid from the pleural cavity   in the chest   Certain drugs: drugs that   can cause lupus-like syndromes (such as hydralazine [Apresoline], Procan [Pronestyl, Procan-SR, Procanbid - these brands no longer are available in the U.S.], phenytoin [Dilantin],              and   others)    Abdominal processes: such   as pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, gallbladder disease, and damage to the spleen.   Pneumothorax: air in the pleural space, occurring spontaneously or from trauma. "
How does the pleura work?,"'The pleura is composed of two layers of thin lining tissue. The layer covering the lung (visceral pleura) and the parietal pleura that covers the inner wall of the chest are lubricated by pleural fluid. Normally, there is about 10-20 ml of clear liquid that acts as a lubricant between these layers. The fluid is continually absorbed and replaced, mainly through the outer lining of the pleura. Pressure inside the pleura is negative (as in sucking) and becomes even more negative during inspiration (breathing in). The pressure becomes less negative during ''exhalation'' (breathing out). Therefore, the space between the two layers of pleura always has a negative pressure. The introduction of air (positive pressure) into the space (such as from a knife ''wound'') will result in a collapse of the lung. ' "
What are the symptoms of pleurisy?,"'Symptoms of pleurisy include:''The most common symptom of pleurisy is pain that is generally aggravated by inspiration (breathing in). Although the lungs themselves do not contain any pain nerves, the pleura contains abundant nerve endings. When extra fluid accumulates in the space between the layers of pleura, the pain usually is a less severe form of pleurisy. With very large amounts of fluid accumulation, the expansion of the lungs can be limited, and shortness of breath can worsen.''The chest (thoracic) cavity represents both the front and back of the upper portion of the body. If the inflammation is more toward the back, then the pain may be described as a ''back pain''. Of importance is that with pleurisy; the pain will worsen with deep breaths. Most other causes of ''back pain'"" don't have this quality, however, for some people ""'back pain'' will worsen with ''cough''. (As can be seen in spinal disc disease.)'   pain in the chest that is aggravated by breathing, shortness of breath, and/or a ""stabbing"" sensation."
How is pleurisy diagnosed?,"'The pain of pleurisy is very distinctive. The pain is in the chest and is usually sharp and aggravated by breathing. However, the pain can be confused with the pain of''To make the diagnosis of pleurisy, a doctor examines the chest in the area of pain and can often hear (with a stethoscope) the friction that is generated by the rubbing of the two inflamed layers of pleura with each breath. The noise generated by this sound is termed a pleural friction rub. (In contrast, the friction of the rubbing that is heard with pericarditis occurs synchronous with the heartbeat and does not vary with ''respiration''.) With large amounts of pleural fluid accumulation, there can be decreased breath sounds (less audible respiratory sounds heard through a stethoscope) and the chest is dull sounding when the doctor drums on it (termed dullness upon percussion).''A chest X-ray taken in the upright position and while lying on the side is a tool in diagnosing fluid in the pleural space. It is possible to estimate the amount of fluid collection by findings on the X-ray. Occasionally, as much as 4-5 liters of fluid can accumulate inside the pleural space.''Ultrasound is a method of detecting the presence of pleural fluid.''A ''CT scan'' can be very helpful in detecting very small amounts of fluid and trapped pockets of pleural fluid, as well as in determining the nature of the tissues surrounding the area.''Removal of pleural fluid with a needle and syringe (aspiration) is essential in diagnosing the cause of pleurisy. The fluid\'s color, consistency, and clarity are analyzed in the laboratory. The fluid analysis is defined as either an ""''exudate''"" (high in protein, low in ''sugar'', high in LDH enzyme, and high white cell count; characteristic of an inflammatory process) or a ""''transudate''"" (containing normal levels of these body chemicals).''The fluid can also be tested for the presence of infectious organisms and ''cancer'' cells. In some cases, a small piece of pleura may be removed for microscopic study (biopsied) if there is suspicion of tuberculosis (''TB'') or cancer. '   inflammation around the heart (pericarditis), or heart attack. Causes of exudative fluid include infections (such as pneumonia), cancer, tuberculosis, and collagen diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus). Causes of transudative fluid are congestive heart failure and liver and kidney diseases. Pulmonary emboli can cause either transudates or exudates in the pleural space."
How is pleurisy treated?,"'External splinting of the chest wall and pain medication can reduce the pain of pleurisy. Treatment of the underlying disease, of course, ultimately relieves the pleurisy. For example, if a heart, lung, or kidney condition is present, it is treated. Removal of fluid from the chest cavity (thoracentesis) can relieve the pain and shortness of breath. Sometimes fluid removal can make the pleurisy temporarily worse because without the lubrication of the fluid, the two inflamed pleural surfaces can rub directly on each other with each breath.''If the pleural fluid shows signs of infection, appropriate treatment involves antibiotics and drainage of the fluid. If there is pus inside the pleural space, a chest drainage tube should be inserted. This procedure involves placing a tube inside the chest under local anesthesia. The tube is then connected to a sealed chamber that is connected to a suction device in order to create a negative pressure environment. In severe cases, in which there are large amounts of pus and ''scar tissue'' (adhesions), there is a need for ""decortication."" This procedure involves examining the pleural space under general anesthesia with a special scope (thoracoscope). Through this pipelike instrument, the ''scar'' tissue, pus, and debris can be removed. Sometimes, an open surgical procedure (thoracotomy) is required for more complicated cases.''In cases of pleural effusion that result from cancer, the fluid often reaccumulates. In this setting, a procedure called pleurodesis is used. This procedure entails instilling an irritant, such as bleomycin, ''tetracycline'', or talc powder, inside the space between the pleural layers in order to create inflammation. This inflammation, in turn, will adhere or tack the two layers of pleura together as scarring develops. This procedure thereby obliterates the space between the pleura and prevents the reaccumulation of fluid.'  "
Can pleurisy be prevented?,"'Some cases of pleurisy can be prevented, depending on the cause. For example, early intervention in treating ''pneumonia'' may prevent the accumulation of pleural fluid. In the case of heart, lung, or ''kidney disease'', management of the underlying disease can help prevent the fluid collection. ' "
What is pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy'' (also termed ''pleuritis'') is inflammation of the double layered membrane that surrounds the ''lungs'' termed the pleura or plural membranes. These membranes surround the lungs (visceral pleura) and line the ribcage (parietal pleura).''The pleura lubricate the lungs, and this allows the lung tissue to easily inflate and deflate as a person breathes in and out. In between the plural membranes is a very thin area containing fluid that allows easy non-painful movement of the lung tissue. When ''pleurisy'' occurs, several things may happen. If inflammation occurs, the two layers of the membrane can become rough and as they attempt to slide, the rough surfaces cause ''pain'"". In other instances, fluid can begin to build up between the membranes and put pressure on the lungs that, in turn, reduces the lungs' ability to move normally and can cause ""'shortness of breath''. This situation is turned a ""plural effusion."" In some people, this ''pleural effusion'' can become infected, and inflammation of the pleura can occur.''Some doctors believe that pleurisy is a symptom of an underlying condition and is not a condition itself. Classification of pleurisy can be acute, subacute, chronic and/or recurrent, depending upon the underlying condition causing pleurisy. In this article, pleurisy will be considered a term for a generalized condition that results in chest discomfort.' "
Is pleurisy contagious?,"'Most doctors agree that pleurisy is not ''contagious'' in itself; however, some of the underlying conditions that may cause pleurisy are considered contagious (for example, ''tuberculosis'', bacterial ''pneumonia'' and viral infections like ''influenza'' [the ''flu'']).''Other diseases that can be the underlying cause of pleurisy are not contagious (for example, ''heart attack'', ''pulmonary embolism'', certain ''cancers'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'' and many others; sometimes the underlying cause of pleurisy is not known).'  "
How will I know if I have pleurisy?,"'Although the underlying causes of pleurisy may have a large number of symptoms, a common feature in patients with pleurisy is having a ""plural rub,"" a situation in which the two membranes (parietal and visceral pleura) move together to cause friction and ''pain'' that is usually sharp. The pain is usually localized to the area that is inflamed and is increased when the patient ''coughs'', sneezes or tries to take a deep breath. During the physical exam, a doctor may hear reduced breath sounds, ''wheezing'' and/or rapid shallow ''breathing''.''Such findings usually cause the health-care professional to order tests like a ''chest X-ray'"", CT of the chest, and/or other tests, depending upon the health-care professional's suspicion of an underlying cause of pleurisy. Often, an ""'EKG'' and blood tests are done to determine whether a medical emergency such as a heart attack has occurred. Consequently, it is important to have a health-care professional quickly diagnose a person that develops the common symptoms of pleurisy.' "
How is pleurisy spread?,"'Pleurisy is not spread from person to person; however, it may spread within the individual to occupy more space. This occurs when the underlying infectious causes further spread into the pleural space or when noninfectious causes result in fluid increases in the pleural space. In some people, both infection and fluid can increase (spread) simultaneously in the pleural space.' "
How will I know if I am cured of pleurisy?,"'Treatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause. It is possible to be cured of pleurisy if the underlying cause is treatable. For example, if the underlying cause like bacterial infection is stopped and cured, the symptoms described above that occur with pleurisy will resolve (abate) over time. The time span is dependent upon the time it takes to cure of the underlying cause of the disease. This situation is the same for the non-infectious causes of pleurisy.''Occasionally, a ''pleural effusion'"" will not clear up even if the underlying cause of pleurisy has been effectively treated, and in other patients, the pleural effusion may compromise breathing. In these situations, a chest tube is placed into the effusion so it can be drained; after effective drainage, most patients' symptoms resolve, and the tube is removed."" "
When should I contact a doctor about pleurisy?,"'Because pleurisy, especially in the acute form, involves ''chest pain'"", is important to be sure that the pain is not due to a medical emergency. Consequently, acute pleuritic pain should be evaluated immediately by an emergency physician to help differentiate between a heart attack or other emergency conditions and new-onset pleurisy. However, other forms of pleurisy (for example, chronic or recurrent) still need to be evaluated quickly by the patient's doctor or specialist to avoid hospitalization and/or complications that could lead to poor outcomes.""

How pleurisy is usually diagnosed?,"'The following tests are usually helpful for diagnosis of pleurisy:' Chest X-rays: They may not show pleurisy, but they can show the fluid collecting between the pleural layers. Chest X-rays can also sometimes identify the cause of pleurisy, such as lung disease, tumor, or rib fracture. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan: It gives more detailed images and can help in the diagnosis of conditions such as blood clots in the lungs. Thoracocentesis: If there is pleural effusion (fluid build-up in the pleural space), the doctor may drain the fluid and send it to be tested to help determine the cause of the pleurisy. Other tests: Sputum samples or throat swabs and blood tests help diagnose infectious causes (viruses or bacteria)."
How pleurisy is usually treated?,"'Treatment for pleurisy usually involves relieving the pain and treating the underlying cause.' Chest pain: A physician may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen to ease pain and fever. Underlying cause: If your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, it'll usually get better on its own after a few days; however, in few conditions, antiviral drugs may be needed if the symptoms are severe or patients are already in poor health. Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics. Patients may need to be admitted to the hospital in very severe cases where the medications are usually given through injections or intravenously. Pleural effusion: Sometimes, pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion. In this condition, patients may develop shortness of breath. The fluid may need to be drained by inserting a needle or tube through the chest wall under general or local anesthesia."

What is polymyositis? What is dermatomyositis?,"'Polymyositis is a disease of muscle featuring inflammation of the muscle fibers. The cause of the disease is not known. It begins when white blood cells, the immune cells of inflammation, spontaneously invade muscles. The muscles affected are typically those closest to the trunk or torso. This results in weakness that can be severe. Polymyositis is a chronic illness featuring progressive muscle weakness with periods of increased symptoms, called flares or relapses, and minimal or no symptoms, known as remissions.''Polymyositis is slightly more common in females. It affects all age groups, although its onset is most common in middle childhood and in the 20s. Polymyositis occurs throughout the world. Polymyositis can be associated with a characteristic skin ''rash'' and is then referred to as ""dermatomyositis."" Dermatomyositis in children is referred to as juvenile dermatomyositis. ""Amyopathic dermatomyositis"" is the term used to describe people who have skin changes compatible with dermatomyositis but do not have diseased muscle involvement.''Polymyositis can also affect other areas of the body and is, therefore, referred to as a systemic illness. Occasionally, it is associated with ''cancer'' or with other diseases of connective tissue (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''). Depending on which other diseases it is associated with, it may be referred to as an ""overlap syndrome"" or ""''mixed connective tissue disease''.""' "
Polymyositis vs. polymyalgia rheumatica,"'Polymyositis is an inflammatory, destructive, autoimmune muscle disease, usually with weakness but unusually with ''pain''. ''Polymyalgia rheumatica'' is an inflammatory disease of muscle that always causes symmetrically painful muscles. ''Polymyalgia rheumatica'' is not destructive to muscles.' "
What causes polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'To date, no cause of polymyositis has been isolated by scientific researchers. There are indicators of heredity (genetic) susceptibility that can be found in some patients. There is indirect evidence of infection by a virus that has yet to be identified in a muscle disease related to polymyositis that is particularly resistant to treatment, called ''inclusion body myositis''. The pathologist, a physician specialist who interprets the microscope findings of muscle tissue, diagnoses this muscle disease. The muscle tissue in inclusion body myositis displays clear areas within the muscle cells (called vacuoles) when viewed under the magnification of a microscope.''Researchers have found that T-cells of the immune system in some polymyositis or dermatomyositis patients reacted against ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'') and that detectable antibodies against ''CMV'' were present. Their conclusion was that there may be subsets of patients who develop their disease, in part, because of infection with this particular virus.''Aside from diseases with which polymyositis can be associated (as mentioned above), many other diseases and conditions can mimic polymyositis. These include nerve-muscle diseases (such as muscular dystrophies), drug toxins (such as ''alcohol'', ''cocaine'', steroids, ''colchicine'', ''hydroxychloroquine'', and ''cholesterol''-lowering ''drugs'', called ''statins''), metabolic disorders (where muscle cells are unable to process chemicals normally), hormone disorders (such as abnormal thyroid), inclusion body myositis, calcium and magnesium conditions, and infectious diseases (such as ''influenza'' virus, ''AIDS'', ''streptococcus'' and Lyme bacteria, pork tapeworm, and ''schistosomiasis'').' "
What are signs and symptoms of polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Weakness of muscles is the most common symptom of polymyositis. The muscles involved usually are those that are closest to the trunk of the body. Both sides of the body are affected. The onset can be gradual or rapid. This results in varying degrees of loss of muscle power and atrophy. The loss of strength can be noticed as difficulty getting up from chairs, ''walking'', climbing stairs, or lifting above the shoulders. Trouble with swallowing and weakness lifting the head from the pillow can occur. Occasionally, the muscles ache and are tender to the touch.''Patients can also feel ''fatigue'', a general feeling of discomfort, and have ''weight loss'' and/or low-grade ''fever''.''Weakness of the muscles that produce the voice can lead to a weak-sounding voice (dysphonia).'""With skin involvement (dermatomyositis), the eyes can be surrounded by a violet discoloration with swelling. There can be scaly reddish discoloration over the knuckles, elbows, and knees (Gottron's sign). There can also be reddish ""'rash'' on the face, neck, and upper chest. The skin changes can occur with or prior to the development of muscle weakness. Hard lumps of calcium deposits can develop in the fatty layer of the skin, most commonly in childhood dermatomyositis.''Heart'' and lung involvement can lead to irregular heart rhythm, ''heart failure'', and inflammation of the ''lungs'' with ''shortness of breath''.''Because polymyositis can appear in combination with other illnesses (see related articles on ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''), it can also have overlap features with them. These illnesses are discussed elsewhere.''Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis can sometimes be associated with ''cancers'', including ''lymphoma'', ''breast cancer'', ''lung cancer'', ''ovarian cancer'', and ''colon cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is reported to be much greater with dermatomyositis than polymyositis.'  "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose polymyositis or dermatomyositis?,"'When a patient first sees the doctor, the recent symptoms especially concerning weakness will be discussed. The condition of many other body areas might be reviewed, for example, the skin, heart, lungs, and joints. An examination will further focus on these and other systems. Various measures of strength might be noted. The characteristic features of polymyositis include weakness of the muscles closest to the trunk of the body, abnormal elevation of muscle enzymes, electromyograph (''EMG'') findings, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') findings, and certain abnormalities detected with muscle biopsy.''Blood testing usually (but not always) reveals abnormally high levels of muscle enzymes, CPK or ''creatinine'' phosphokinase, aldolase, SGOT, SGPT, and LDH. These enzymes are released into the blood by muscle that is being damaged by inflammation. They can also be used as measures of the activity of the inflammation. Other routine blood and urine tests can also look for internal organ abnormalities. Chest ''X-rays'', mammograms, PAP smears, and other screening tests might be considered. Autoantibodies can often be found in the blood of people with polymyositis. These include antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and myositis-specific antibodies (such as Jo-1 antibody).''An electromyograph (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity are electrical tests of muscle and nerves that can show abnormal findings typical of polymyositis as well as exclude other nerve-muscle diseases.''Imaging of the muscles using radiology tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scanning), can show areas of inflammation of muscle. This sometimes can be used to determine optimal muscle biopsy sites.''A muscle biopsy is used to confirm the presence of muscle inflammation typical only of polymyositis. This is a surgical procedure whereby muscle tissue is removed for analysis by a pathologist, a specialist in examining tissue under a microscope. Muscles often used for biopsy include the ''quadriceps'' muscle of the front of the thigh, the biceps muscle of the arm, and the deltoid muscle of the shoulder.' "
What types of doctors treat polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Polymyositis is typically treated by ''rheumatologists''. Others who can be involved in the care of patients with polymyositis include internists, pathologists, dermatologists, radiologists, cardiologists, neurologists, surgeons, and physiatrists.' "
What is the treatment for polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Initially, polymyositis is treated with high doses of ''corticosteroids''. Corticosteroids are cortisone medications (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''). These are medications related to cortisone and can be given by mouth or intravenously. They are given because they can have a powerful effect to decrease the inflammation in the muscles. They usually are required for years, and their continued use will be based on what the doctor finds related to symptoms, examination, and muscle enzyme blood test.''Corticosteroids have many predictable and unpredictable side effects. In high doses, they commonly cause an increase in appetite and weight, puffiness of the face, and ''easy bruising''. They can also cause sweats, facial-hair growth, ''upset stomach'', sensitive emotions, ''leg swelling'', ''acne'', ''cataracts'', ''osteoporosis'', ''high blood pressure'', worsening of ''diabetes'', and increased risk of infection. A rare complication of cortisone medications is severe bone damage (''avascular necrosis'') which can destroy large joints, such as the hips and shoulders. Further, abruptly stopping corticosteroids can cause flares of the disease and result in other side effects, including ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and decreased ''blood pressure''.''Corticosteroids do not always adequately improve polymyositis. In these patients, immunosuppressive medications are considered. These medications can be effective by suppressing the immune response that attracts the white blood cells of inflammation to the muscles. Many types are now commonly used and others are still experimental. ''Methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'') can be taken by mouth or by injection into the body. ''Azathioprine'' (Imuran) is an oral drug. Both can cause ''liver'' and bone-marrow side effects and require regular blood monitoring. ''Cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), and ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'') have been used for serious complications of severe disease, such as scarring of the lungs (''pulmonary fibrosis''). These also can have severe side effects which must be considered with each patient individually. Treatment with intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins (IVIG) has been shown to be effective in severe cases of polymyositis that are resistant to other treatments. Recent research reports indicate that intravenous ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') may be helpful in treating resistant disease.''Patients with calcium deposits (calcinosis) from dermatomyositis can sometimes benefit by taking ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem'') to shrink the size of the calcium deposits. This effect, however, occurs slowly (frequently over years) and is not always effective. The complication of calcium deposits in muscles and soft tissues occurs more frequently in children than adults.''Physical therapy with gradual muscle strengthening is an important part of the treatment of polymyositis. When to begin and the continued degree of ''exercise'' and range of motion of extremities is customized for each patient.''Patients can ultimately do well, especially with early medical treatment of disease and disease flares. The disease frequently becomes inactive, and rehabilitation of atrophied muscle becomes a long-term project. Monitoring for signs of ''cancer'', heart, and lung disease are essential. Accordingly, ''EKG'', lung function testing, and X-ray tests are used.''As mentioned above, the related muscle disease called inclusion body myositis is often more resistant to treatment than polymyositis. As scientists better define the specific causes of the different forms of polymyositis, treatment will be more accurately aimed at cure of this disease. Researchers are finding more specific antibodies in patients that may be used to diagnose and define active disease.'  "
What are home remedies for polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,'The best home remedy is to closely monitor the condition with the physician and physical therapist. It is best to not over-''exercise'' early on but gradually increase exercise for optimal results.' 
What is the prognosis for polymyositis?,"'The outcome for patients with polymyositis varies. While some have a relatively brief illness followed by remission not requiring subsequent treatment, others develop episodes of remissions and exacerbations requiring more or less treatment.''The presence of Jo-1 antibody, a myositis antibody, is predictive of an increased risk for the development of inflammation of the tissues of the lungs (''interstitial lung disease''). This can lead to permanent suboptimal lung function. Pulmonary function testing can be used to detect early lung abnormalities.' "
"What are risk factors for worse outcomes with polymyositis 
or dermatomyositis?","'Patients with polymyositis tend to have a higher risk for worse outcomes with older age, delay in cortisone treatment, cancer, lung or ''heart disease'', or ''difficulty swallowing''.''Cancer screening'' is performed, especially in patients with dermatomyositis, due to an increased risk of cancer in patients with muscle inflammation.' "
Is it possible to prevent polymyositis?,"'There is no ''prevention'' for polymyositis. When the precise cause of polymyositis is identified, preventative measures might be possible.' "
Are there support groups for people with polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,'Consider seeking a support group through the local branch of the ''Arthritis'' Foundation.' 
Where can people find more information on polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'For further information about polymyositis and dermatomyositis, please visit the following site:''Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org)''P.O.

What is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)?,"'Premenstrual'' dysphoric disorder (PMDD) can be considered a severe form of ''premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS''). Both ''PMS'"" and PMDD are characterized by unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms that occur in the second half of a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'', most commonly in the days preceding the ''menstrual period''. Physical symptoms such as ''bloating'', breast tenderness, ''headaches'', ''joint pain'', food cravings, ''mood swings'' or frequent crying, ''panic attacks'', ''fatigue'', ''mood changes'', irritability, and trouble focusing are among the most common symptoms. Other symptoms like ''anxiety'' and trouble sleeping have been reported. ''PMS symptoms'"" may be troubling and unpleasant. PMDD may cause severe, debilitating symptoms that interfere with a woman's ability to function.""'The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) estimates that at least 85 percent of menstruating women have at least one ''PMS'' symptom as part of their monthly cycle. PMS is much more common than PMDD. You must have 5 or more of the symptoms listed above to be diagnosed with PMDD.''Biologic, psychological, environmental, and social factors all seem to play a part in PMDD. It is important to note that PMDD is not the fault of the woman suffering from it or the result of a ""weak"" or unstable personality. It is also not something that is ""all in the woman\'s head."" Rather, PMDD is a medical illness that impacts only 3% to 8% of women. Fortunately, it can be treated by a health care professional with behavioral and pharmaceutical options.''PMDD has been previously medically referred to as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder.'  "
What are the symptoms of PMDD?,"'Symptoms of PMS'' and PMDD can be similar but are more intense and debilitating in PMDD. The symptoms of PMDD also may vary among affected women. Some of the most commonly reported symptoms include:''PMDD symptoms are related to the ''menstrual cycle'', typically occurring in the second half (luteal phase) of the cycle, and resolving within the first few days after the ''menstrual period'' has begun.'   Fatigue Mood changes Abdominal bloating Breast tenderness Headache Irritability Depression Increased appetite Acne Oversensitivity to environmental stimuli Hot flashes, Heart palpitations Easy crying Difficulty concentrating Dizziness Sleeplessness Forgetfulness Gastrointestinal (stomach, bowel) upset"
What causes PMDD?,"'Although the precise cause of PMS and PMDD is unknown, it is believed that these conditions result from the interaction of hormones produced by the ovaries at different stages in the menstrual cycle (such as estrogen and ''progesterone'"") with the neurotransmitters (chemicals that serve as messengers such as serotonin) in the brain. While the ovarian hormone levels are normal in women with PMDD, it is likely that the brain's response to these normally-fluctuating hormone levels is abnormal.""'Most evidence suggests that PMS and PMDD do not result from any specific personality traits or personality types. While ''stress'' clearly is associated with PMS and PMDD, it is not considered to be a cause of PMDD. Rather, the associated ''stress'' is more likely to be a result of the PMS or PMDD symptoms. Vitamin or other nutritional deficiencies have not been shown to cause PMS or PMDD.'  "
When should I call a doctor about PMDD?,'It is appropriate to seek medical care for troubling physical or emotional symptoms related to the menstrual cycle.''It is important to note that the depressive symptoms of PMDD may be associated with thoughts of ''suicide'' and ''suicidal'' behavior. This is a medical emergency for which medical attention should be accessed immediately.' 
What vitamins and natural home remedies treat and provide pain relief and other symptoms of PMDD?,"'Other treatments have been shown in some studies to be beneficial in managing PMDD symptoms. Chasteberry extract (agnus castus fruit) was effective in decreasing the ''symptoms of PMS'' in a controlled trial. Several ''dietary supplements'', including calcium, vitamin B6, and ''vitamin E'', have also been shown in limited studies to reduce PMS/PMDD symptoms.' "
How is PMDD diagnosed?,"'PMDD must be distinguished from other physical and psychological conditions that can produce the same symptoms. The differential diagnosis (list of conditions that may produce the same symptoms) includes both mood and ''anxiety'' disorders as well as medical conditions such as ''thyroid disease''. In addition to a thorough medical history and physical examination, blood tests may be performed to rule out whether medical conditions may be present that may account for the PMDD symptoms.''If PMDD is a concern, it is recommended that women complete a symptom chart or calendar prospectively (meaning that they record their symptoms each day for a given period) to establish the diagnosis. The symptom chart can be compared with the menstrual calendar to illustrate the relationship of symptoms to the menstrual cycle.''The American Psychiatric Association has established formal guidelines for the diagnosis of PMDD in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The DSM diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PMDD require prospective documentation of symptoms being present for most menstrual cycles.'""Five or more of the following symptoms must have been present during the week prior to the menstrual period and resolve within a few days of the start of the woman's period. The symptoms must interfere with the activities of a woman's daily living and not be a result of another condition or illness. At least one of the symptoms must be one of the first four on the list:""'Other physical symptoms of PMDD include:' Feeling sad, hopeless, or self-deprecating Feeling tense, anxious, or ""on edge"" Marked changes in mood, becoming sad or tearful Persistent irritability, anger, and increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities, which may be associated with withdrawal from social relationships Difficulty concentrating Feeling fatigued, lethargic, or lacking in energy Marked changes in appetite, which may be associated with binge eating or craving certain foods Hypersomnia (excessive sleeping) or insomnia A subjective feeling of being overwhelmed or out of control Breast tenderness or swelling Headaches Joint or muscle pain A sensation of feeling bloated Weight gain"
Antidepressants (SSRIs) to treat and manage PMDD symptoms,"'A number of medical therapies have been shown to be effective in managing PMDD symptoms.''Several members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of medications are effective in the treatment of PMDD. These medications work by regulating the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. SSRIs that have shown to be effective in the treatment of PMDD include:''Up to 75% of women report relief of symptoms when treated with SSRI medications. Side effects can occur in up to 15% of women and include ''nausea'', ''anxiety'', and ''headache''. SSRI medications to treat PMDD may be prescribed to be taken continuously or only during the 14-day luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle. Other types of ''antidepressants'' (''tricyclic antidepressants'' and ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'') and ''lithium'' (''Lithobid'') have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of PMDD.'   fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)."
Oral contraceptives and GnRH agonists treat PMDD,"'Medications that interfere with ''ovulation'' and the production of ovarian hormones have also been used to treat PMDD. Oral ''contraceptive'' pills (OCPs, ''birth control pills'') can be prescribed to suppress ovulation and regulate the menstrual cycle.''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH analogs or GnRH agonists) have also been used to treat PMDD. These ''drugs'' suppress estrogen production by the ovaries by inhibiting the secretion of regulatory hormones from the ''pituitary gland''. As a result, menstrual periods stop, mimicking ''menopause''. Nasal and injection forms of GnRH agonists are available.''Examples of GnRH agonists include:''The side effects of GnRH agonist drugs are a result of the lack of estrogen, and include:''Adding back small amounts of estrogen and ''progesterone'' can help avoid or minimize many of the annoying side effects due to estrogen deficiency and help preserve ''bone density''.' leuprolide (Lupron) nafarelin (Synarel) goserelin (Zoladex) Hot flashes Vaginal dryness Irregular vaginal bleeding Mood changes Fatigue Osteoporosis"
What are the complications of PMDD?,"""PMDD by definition is characterized by symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and activities. If untreated, these symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and a woman's ability to function at work, school, or home. Further, mood changes and ""'depression'' that may accompany PMDD can be associated with ''suicidal thoughts'' and behavior.' "
What is the prognosis for PMDD? Is there a cure?,"'Although the symptoms of PMDD can be debilitating, treatments are available that are effective in controlling symptoms for a majority of women.' "
Can PMDD be prevented?,"'Since PMDD is thought to result from interactions between ovarian hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain, there is no known way to prevent its occurrence.' "
Facts you should know about polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)," Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a disease that causes pain and stiffness in muscles and joints, low-grade fever, and weight loss. Health care professionals diagnose PMR by characteristic common symptoms associated with abnormal blood testing for inflammation. Treatment of PMR involves taking low doses of cortisone medications."
What is polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disease of the muscles and joints characterized by ''muscle pain'' (''myalgia'') and stiffness, affecting both sides of the body, and involving the shoulders, arms, neck, and buttock areas. People with the disease are typically over 50 years of age. Polymyalgia rheumatica is abbreviated PMR.''PMR and ''temporal arteritis'' (''giant cell arteritis'') sometimes occur in the same patient. About 10%-15% of people with PMR also have ''giant cell arteritis''.' "
What are polymyalgia rheumatica causes and risk factors?,"'The cause of the condition is not known. Recent research has indicated that genetic (''inherited'') risk factors play a role in who becomes afflicted with the illness. Theories include viral stimulation of the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. Rarely, the disease is associated with a ''cancer''. In this setting, the ''cancer'' may be initiating an inflammatory immune response to cause the polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms.' "
What are common symptoms and signs of polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The onset of the disease can be sudden. A patient may have a healthy history until awakening one morning with stiffness and ''pain'' of muscles and joints throughout the body, particularly in the upper arms, hips, neck, and shoulders. These pains can lead to a sensation of ''weakness'' and loss of function. Sometimes there is also muscle tenderness with PMR. These clinical symptoms persist and often include an intense sensation of ''fatigue''. Some patients notice a gradual ''loss of appetite'' accompanied by ''weight loss'' and ''lack of energy''. ''Depression'' can occur.'  "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The diagnosis of the disorder is suggested by the health history and physical examination. A health care professional frequently notes muscle tenderness and that the motion of the shoulders is limited by pain. The joints are usually not swollen. However, signs such as swelling of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and/or knees can occur. Blood testing for inflammation is generally abnormal, as indicated by a significant elevation in the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (sed rate or ESR) and/or ''C-reactive protein''. There are no specific tests, however, for the condition and ''X-rays'' are normal. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic history of persisting muscle and ''joint pain'' and stiffness associated with elevated blood tests for inflammation, such as the ESR. It is also not unusual for patients to have slight elevations of ''liver blood tests''.'  "
What is the medical treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'Doctors direct their medical treatment of PMR toward reducing pain and inflammation. While some patients with mild symptoms can improve with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), most patients respond best to low doses of ''corticosteroids'' (such as ''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone''). Not infrequently, a single day of cortisone medicine eases many of the symptoms! In fact, the rapid, gratifying results with low dose corticosteroids is characteristic of the condition.''The ''corticosteroid'' dose is gradually reduced while the doctor monitors the symptoms and normalization of the blood ESR. Reactivation of symptoms can require periodic adjustments in the prednisone dosage. Most patients are able to completely wean from the corticosteroid within several years. Some patients require longer-term medical treatment. Occasionally, patients have recurrence years after the symptoms have resolved. The ideal prednisone dosing regimen continues to be sought by clinical researchers.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The outlook for patients with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica is ultimately very good.''One of the keys to successful treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica is gradual, and not rapid, tapering of the medicines. This can avoid unwanted flare-ups of the disease.''Because the medicines prednisone and prednisolone are associated with potential bone toxicity, causing ''osteoporosis'', patients should consider calcium and ''vitamin D'' supplementation. ''Bone mineral density'' testing should be performed in appropriate patients, and doctors may consider prescribing ''osteoporosis'' medicines, such as estrogen, ''alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), and ''risedronate'' (''Actonel'') for some.' "
Is it possible to prevent polymyalgia rheumatica?,'There is no ''prevention'' for polymyalgia rheumatica. Prevention measures focus on preventing side effects of drugs used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica.' 
What are polymyalgia rheumatica complications?,"'Polymyalgia rheumatica can lead to loss of function of joints if untreated. This generally is temporary, but frozen shoulders can be a further medical complication. Additional complications can result from medications used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica. These include stomach bleeding or kidney impairment from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ''cataracts'', ''bruising'' of skin, and ''osteoporosis'' from cortisone medications. Therefore, the lowest possible doses of medications are best.''Polymyalgia rheumatica can occur in association with giant cell arteritis (''temporal arteritis''). Giant cell arteritis is a potentially more serious condition. It can also occur, as mentioned above, in association with a ''cancer''. The prognosis in this setting is based on the ability to cure the cancer. The polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms resolve with resolution of the cancer.'  "
What is PMS (premenstrual syndrome)?,"""Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, and psychological disturbances that occur after a woman's ""'ovulation'', typically ending with the onset of her menstrual flow. The most common mood-related symptoms are irritability, ''depression'', crying, oversensitivity, and mood swings. The most common physical symptoms are ''fatigue'', bloating, breast tenderness (''mastalgia''), ''acne'' flare-ups, and appetite changes with food cravings.''A more severe form of PMS, known as ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'' (''PMDD''), also known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, occurs in a smaller number of women and leads to significant loss of function because of unusually severe symptoms. The American Psychiatric Association characterizes ''PMDD'' as a severe form of PMS in which anger, irritability, and ''anxiety'' or tension are especially prominent.' "
How many women suffer from PMS?,"'About 90% of women experience premenstrual symptoms at some point in their lifetime. The true incidence of PMS has often been overestimated by including all women who experience any physical or emotional symptoms prior to ''menstruation'"". It is estimated that clinically significant PMS (which is moderate to severe in intensity and affects a woman's functioning) occurs in 20% to 30% of women. It is generally most severe in women in their 4th decade of life. About 3% to 8% of women are believed to have the condition."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of PMS?,"'A great variety of symptoms have been attributed to PMS. Women can have PMS of varying duration and severity from cycle to cycle. The most frequent ''mood-related symptoms'' of PMS include;''The most frequent ''physical signs and symptoms of PMS'' include:' anger and irritability, anxiety, tension, depression, crying, oversensitivity, and exaggerated mood swings. fatigue, bloating (due to fluid retention), weight gain, breast tenderness, acne, sleep disturbances with sleeping too much or too little (insomnia), and appetite changes with overeating or food cravings."
PMS vs. pregnancy symptoms,'A great variety of symptoms have been attributed to PMS. Women can have PMS of varying duration and severity from cycle to cycle.

How long do PMS symptoms and signs last?,"'The duration of PMS varies among women. Most women experience the symptoms for a few to several days in the week prior to the onset of their menstrual period. Some women may have symptoms for a shorter or longer time period, but symptoms of PMS typically start after ovulation (the mid-point in the monthly menstrual cycle).' "
What causes PMS?,"'PMS remains an enigma because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories have been proven, and specific ''treatment for PMS'' still largely lacks a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from the alterations in or interactions between the levels of sex hormones and brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.''PMS does not appear to be specifically associated with any personality factors or specific personality types. Likewise, a number of studies have shown that psychological ''stress'' is not related to the severity of PMS.' "
What conditions mimic PMS?,"'Some examples of medical conditions that can mimic PMS include:''The hallmark of the diagnosis of PMS is that symptom-free interval after the menstrual flow and prior to the next ovulation. If there is no such interval and the symptoms persist throughout the cycle, then PMS may not be the proper diagnosis. PMS can still be present and aggravate symptoms related to the other conditions, but it cannot be the sole cause of constant or non-cyclic symptoms. Blood or other tests may be ordered to help rule out other potential causes of symptoms.''Another way to help make the diagnosis of PMS is to prescribe drugs that stop all ovarian function. If these medications produce relief of the troublesome symptoms, then PMS is most likely the diagnosis.' Depression Cyclic water retention (idiopathic edema) Chronic fatigue Hypothyroidism Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)"
What tests diagnose PMS?,"'The most helpful diagnostic tool is the menstrual diary, which documents physical and emotional symptoms over months. If the changes occur consistently around ovulation (mid-menstrual cycle) and persist until the menstrual flow begins, then PMS is probably the accurate diagnosis. Keeping a menstrual diary not only helps the health-care professional to make the diagnosis, but also promotes a better understanding by the patient of her own body and ''moods''. Once the diagnosis of PMS is made and understood, the patient can better cope with the symptoms.''The diagnosis of PMS can be difficult because many medical and psychological conditions can mimic or worsen symptoms of PMS. There are no blood or laboratory tests to determine if a woman has PMS. When laboratory tests are performed, they are used to exclude other conditions that can mimic PMS.' "
What are the treatments for PMS?,"'The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as making the diagnosis of PMS. Various treatment approaches have been used to treat this condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients.''General management includes a healthy lifestyle including:''All of the above have been recommended and may help symptoms in some women. Furthermore, some studies suggest that calcium and magnesium ''supplements'' may provide some benefit.'   Exercise Emotional support during the premenstrual period Salt restriction before the menstrual period Decreased caffeine intake prior to menstruation Smoking cessation Limitation of alcohol intake Reduction of refined sugar intake"
What natural herbal remedies relieve PMS pain and other symptoms?,"'A variety of medications are used to treat the different symptoms of PMS. Medications include diuretics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, antidepressants, and drugs that suppress ovarian function.''It is important to know that these drugs, although useful in treating mood disturbances in some women, are not necessarily effective in treating the physical symptoms. Often, it is a combination of ''diet'', medications and exercise that is needed to afford the maximum improvement from the many symptoms of PMS'  Diuretics: Diuretics are medications that increase the rate of urine production, thereby eliminating excess fluid from the body tissues. Several nonprescription menstrual products (including Diurex PMS, Lurline PMS, Midol PMS, Pamprin Multisymptom and Premesyn PMS) contain diuretics, and either caffeine or pamabrom. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a prescription diuretic that has been widely used to treat premenstrual swelling of the hands, feet and face. Unfortunately, it has not been effective in all patients. Pain killers (analgesics): These are commonly given for menstrual cramps, headaches, and pelvic discomfort. The most effective group of analgesics appear to be the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Benzodiazepines: The benzodiazepine alprazolam (Xanax) has been shown in some studies to relieve the depressive symptoms of PMS or PMDD. However, this drug is not considered a first-line treatment for these conditions because of its addictive potential. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs): OCPs are sometimes prescribed to even out ovarian hormone fluctuations. While older studies failed to provide evidence that oral contraceptive pills can consistently provide relief for symptoms of PMS, the newer birth control pills, with their improved hormonal formulations, seem to be more beneficial for many women. Oral contraceptive pills containing the progestin drospirenone have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Ovarian suppressors: Drugs like danazol (Danocrine) have been prescribed to suppress ovarian hormone production. Unfortunately, Danocrine cannot be used over long periods because of side effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Complete suppression of ovarian function by a group of drugs called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs has been found to help some women with PMS. These GnRH analogs are not given over the long term (more than six months) because of their potential for adverse effects on bone density causing an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). In some cases these drugs may be prescribed along with hormone supplementation. Antidepressants: These are widely used in treating the mood disturbances related to PMS. Antidepressants appear to work by increasing brain chemical (opioids, serotonin, and others) levels that are affected by the ovarian hormones. These neurotransmitters are important in the control of mood and emotions. The serotonin reuptake inhibitor group of antidepressants seem to be the most effective for symptoms of PMS. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil) are examples of antidepressant medications from this group that have been found to be effective in treating the mood changes associated with PMS."

What exercises relieve PMS pain and other symptoms?,"'Evidence suggests that exercise can help relieve some of the symptoms of PMS in adolescents and young women. Physical activity improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and ''anxiety''. Exercise is believed to release endorphins.

"Is there a ""cure"" for PMS?"," Widespread recognition of PMS has attracted a broad range of research interest in the treatment and management of the symptoms of PMS. Although there is no ""cure"" for PMS at this time, there are many options for managing its signs and symptoms. The first priority is an accurate diagnosis. Other medical or psychological conditions should be identified and treated. Proper diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes can improve overall health and thereby lead to the reduction of symptoms. If these measures are not effective, over-the-counter or prescription medications may be indicated. Most women can control their PMS symptoms successfully and continue to lead healthy and productive lives."
What are menstrual cramps?,"'Menstrual cramps are abdominal and pelvic pains experienced by a woman around the time of her ''menstrual period''. Menstrual cramps usually start shortly before the menstrual period, peak within 24 hours after their onset, and subside after a day or two.'""Menstrual cramps can range from mild to severe. Mild menstrual cramps may be barely noticeable, short-lived, and are sometimes felt only as a sense of mild pressure in the abdomen and pelvis. Severe menstrual cramps can be so painful that they interfere with a woman's regular activities for several days. The discomfort can extend to the lower back or legs. Menstrual cramps are not the same as the symptoms experienced due to ""'premenstrual'' syndrome (PMS), although the symptoms of both disorders can sometimes be experienced together. Many women suffer from both PMS and menstrual cramps.''Medical research of menstrual cramps has shown that they are often worse in women who began menstruating early and who have long menstrual periods associated with heavy menstrual flow. ''Smoking'' and a family history of severe menstrual cramps are also associated with severe dysmenorrhea.' "
What is the treatment for common menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea)?,"'Treatment options vary and each woman needs to find the treatment that works best for her. Non-drug measures that may help include adequate rest and ''sleep'', regular ''exercise'' (especially walking), and ''smoking'' cessation. Some women find that abdominal ''massage'', ''yoga'', or orgasmic sexual activity can help. A heating pad applied to the abdominal area may also relieve the ''pain''.''For mild menstrual cramps, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) aspirin and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or acetaminophen plus a diuretic (such as Diurex MPR, Midol, Pamprin, Premesyn) may help. However, aspirin has a limited effect in curbing the production of prostaglandin and is only useful for mild cramps. For moderate menstrual cramps, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful. The NSAIDs are more effective than aspirin in inhibiting the production and action of the prostaglandins. NSAIDs that are available OTC are:''For optimal control of menstrual cramps, a woman should start taking a ''NSAID'' before the onset of her ''pain'' becomes difficult to control. This might mean starting medication 1 to 2 days before the onset of her period and continuing the medication for the first 1 to 2 days of her period. The best results are obtained by taking one of the NSAIDs on a regular schedule rather than on an as needed basis. Therefore, ibuprofen should be taken every 4-6 hours, ketoprofen every 4-8 hours, and naproxen every 8-12 hours for the first few days of the menstrual flow.''Prescription NSAIDs available for the treatment of menstrual cramps include ''mefenamic acid'' (''Ponstel'').' ibuprofen (Advil, Midol IB, Motrin, Nuprin, and others); naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox); and ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)."
What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"""Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, psychological, and mood disturbances that occur after a woman's ovulation and normally end with the onset of her menstrual flow.""'PMS remains a puzzle because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories has been proven and specific treatments for PMS largely lack a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from alterations in or interactions among the levels of sex hormones and brain chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.' "
What treatments are available for PMS?,"'The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as diagnosing the condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients. General measures include:''Research studies have linked a deficiency of calcium and magnesium to PMS; therefore, it may be beneficial for woman to try ''supplements'' of these nutrients at recommended dosages. Some women have reported relief of symptoms with these ''supplements''. It is always important to follow recommended guidelines when taking vitamin supplements, since taking excess doses of some supplements may be harmful.'  Exercise: Aerobic exercise for 30 minutes 3-5 times a week improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and anxiety. Exercise also improves cardiovascular fitness and muscle tone, decreases weight and fluid retention, and improves self-esteem. Emotional support from family and friends. Stress reduction and stress management: Learning relaxation techniques, and developing coping mechanisms to reduce stress. Dietary changes: Reduce salt and refined sugar intake (too much salt and refined sugar exacerbates fluid retention). Avoid caffeine, as this may increase irritability Decrease the intake of animal fats. Avoid cigarettes and alcohol."
What medications are used to treat PMS?,"'Medications used to treat the different ''symptoms of PMS'' include taking:' Diuretics, which are medications that increase urine production, thereby eliminating excess fluid and relieving weight gain, bloating, and swelling. Ammonium chloride, caffeine, and pamabrom are mild diuretics that are ingredients in nonprescription OTC products such as Diurex PMS, Lurline PMS, Midol PMS, Pamprin Multisymptom, and Premesyn PMS. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a prescription diuretic that has been used to treat premenstrual swelling of the hands, feet, and/or face. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) that are commonly used for menstrual cramps, headaches, and pelvic discomfort. NSAIDs are available as both prescription and non-prescription products. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox), ketoprofen (Orudis), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that are sometimes prescribed by doctors to decrease fluctuations in ovarian hormone levels. While older studies failed to provide evidence that OCPs can consistently provide relief for symptoms of PMS, the newer low-dose birth control pills, with their improved hormonal formulations, seem to be more beneficial. Ovarian suppressors such as danazol (Danocrine) have been prescribed by doctors to suppress ovarian hormone production. Danocrine cannot be used over long periods because of side effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which cause the complete suppression of ovarian function, and have been found to be helpful in treating some women with PMS. These GnRH analogs are not prescribed long term (more than 6 months) because of their adverse effects on bone density and an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). Antidepressants which are prescribed by doctors to treat the mood disturbances related to PMS. Antidepressants appear to work by increasing brain chemical (serotonin and others) levels that are affected by the ovarian hormones. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil). These are examples of antidepressant medications that have been found to be effective in treating the mood changes associated with PMS."
What are some guidelines for the safe use of OTC products for menstrual cramps and PMS?," Always read the labels and know the ingredients in the products. Never take more than the recommended doses without first checking with your doctor. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause ulcers and should be avoided by patients with known peptic ulcer disease or reflux esophagitis. They can also increase the risk of bleeding and should be avoided by women with certain blood diseases. Women who are scheduled for elective surgery should inform their doctors that they are taking aspirin or NSAIDs. The doctor may ask them to withhold these medications for a period of time prior to the procedure. True aspirin allergy is rare. However, it may lead to hives, difficulty breathing, and/or shock within three hours of ingestion. Aspirin allergy is most common among individuals who have asthma, hives, or nasal polyps. Individuals with true aspirin allergy should also avoid NSAIDs because they are chemically similar to aspirin. Aspirin (and many other medications and some vitamins) can increase the anti-coagulant effect of the blood-thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin) resulting in an increased risk of bleeding. Patients taking warfarin to prevent strokes and other thrombocytic diseases should not use prescription or OTC medications for menstrual cramps or PMS without first checking with the doctor supervising their warfarin dosages. Most healthy adults tolerate aspirin and NSAIDs well, but some may develop side effects such as headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, heartburn, poor appetite, constipation, or diarrhea. Taking these drugs with food can decrease the stomach upset and heartburn. Ammonium chloride, an OTC diuretic, is an acid that can cause stomach upset in high doses. It can also cause an excess accumulation of acid (acidosis) in the blood of patients with kidney and liver disease. Caffeine is a diuretic and a stimulant. It can cause restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia. Nervousness, irritability, and nausea can occur if caffeine-containing foods and beverages are consumed concurrently. Women taking certain asthma medications such as aminophylline or theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theoair) should also avoid caffeine."
How can I tell if it is PMS or if I am pregnant?,"'Many women have difficulty figuring out if they are ''pregnant'', have ''PMS'', or are about to start their period. The most common signs and symptoms of early ''pregnancy'', ''PMS'', and the start of your period include ''mood swings'', ''back pain'', ''increased urination'', and tender breasts. These three conditions also share other similar signs and symptoms, but there are unique differences between each. Moreover, there are symptoms that only occur if you are pregnant.''The only way to find out if you are pregnant is with a ''pregnancy test''. Home ''pregnancy test'' kits are available without a prescription at pharmacies and most grocery stores.'  "
What is PMS (premenstrual syndrome)?,"'Menstruation'' (period) is the process of bleeding from the vagina (known as the ''menstrual period'') that occurs at the end of each ''menstrual cycle''. ''Menstruation'' begins during ''puberty'' and lasts until ''menopause''. Your period starts when the lining of the uterus sheds (approximately every 28 days) because ''pregnancy'' did not occur. Your ''menstrual period'' is due to the normal variation in levels of the hormones estrogen and ''progesterone'', known as the ''menstrual cycle''. Many women experience symptoms including cramping, ''bloating'', breast tenderness, and ''mood changes'' around the time of the ''menstrual period''.''PMS'', or ''premenstrual syndrome'', is a condition characterized by psychological and physical symptoms that develop at some point after you ovulate (which occurs during the middle of the menstrual cycle), and ends when you start your period. ''Symptoms of PMS'' can include irritability, ''depression'', crying, ''fatigue'', ''bloating'', ''acne'', breast tenderness (''mastalgia''), and appetite changes including food cravings. While 90% of women are believed to have some symptoms associated with ''menstruation'', true PMS is more severe and likely occurs in 20% to 30% of women.' "
Similarities between PMS vs. pregnancy symptoms and signs,"'For many women, the signs and symptoms of early pregnancy can resemble those of her approaching ''menstrual period'' or PMS. In fact, it is not possible to tell from early symptoms alone if a woman is pregnant or having symptoms related to her upcoming menstrual period.''The most similar common signs and symptoms that these conditions share include:' Headaches: Headaches can be a symptom of pregnancy, but many women also experience headaches or migraines prior to the menstrual period or with PMS. Back pain: This symptom can be if your period is approaching, but it also can be a symptom that you are pregnant. Mood changes (irritability, anxiety, crying spells): Mood changes are common in both PMS and early pregnancy. These changes can include depression, anxiety, irritability, and mood swings. Constipation: The hormone progesterone can lead to digestive disturbances including constipation. Because levels of progesterone rise during the second half of the menstrual cycle, constipation can be present in women with PMS or an approaching menstrual period. Likewise, the hormonal changes of early pregnancy may also cause constipation. Increased urination: You may have increased urination if you are pregnant or your about to have your period. Breast pain and tenderness: Breast pain, tenderness, breast swelling, or enlargement, can occur in early pregnancy as well as prior to your period. The breasts may feel heavy, sore, or sensitive in both conditions."
Differences between PMS vs. pregnancy signs and symptoms," Bleeding or spotting: Mild spotting (not enough bleeding to soak a pad or tampon) sometimes occurs around the time of implantation of the embryo into the uterus in early pregnancy. This is known as implantation bleeding. This is not the same as the heavy bleeding some women may experience at the beginning of her period. Fatigue: Fatigue is common in women in the early stages of pregnancy, but it also occurs as a sign of PMS in many women. However, the fatigue of PMS generally goes away once the period starts. Food cravings/aversions: Many women experience food cravings or increased appetite prior to the onset of her period. Food cravings and aversions also are typical of pregnancy, although the food cravings of pregnancy are often more specific and intense than during PMS or prior to menstruation. Nausea and or vomiting: Nausea and vomiting are more typical of early pregnancy and are not common symptoms of PMS or an approaching menstrual period. Therefore, if you are pregnant you are more likely to experience these symptoms. Cramping: Abdominal or pelvic cramping and pain occur in many women prior to, or even during her menstrual period. These symptoms often are particularly troublesome for women with PMS. However, some women may have mild cramping in the early stages of pregnancy."
What symptoms and signs are unique to pregnancy?,"'Certain symptoms are more characteristic of early pregnancy, and are less likely to occur due to an impending menstrual period or PMS.'   Missed or late period: The absence of menstruation is the hallmark symptom of pregnancy. Implantation bleeding or cramping: As discussed previously, there may be very mild bleeding and cramping at the time of implantation of the embryo in the uterus during early pregnancy. This is very different from the normal menstrual flow. Vaginal discharge: Increased estrogen production in pregnancy may lead to an increase in milky, white vaginal discharge. Darkening of the areola or nipple: Darkening or enlargement of the areola or nipple can occur as early as a week or two after conception in early pregnancy. It also may develop later in pregnancy. This is not a sign of PMS or approaching menstruation."
What is the 2-week wait?,"'The ""2-week wait"" is a term that has been used to describe the time interval between ''ovulation'' and implantation, or the approximate point at which a pregnancy test will yield a definitive answer. Many tests available on the market today are able to determine if you are pregnant, even before the date of the expected menstrual period.' "
What is pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination is a method of preventing a specific type of lung infection (''pneumonia'') that is caused by the pneumococcus (''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'') bacterium. There are more than 80 different types of pneumococcus bacteria -- 23 of them covered by the ''vaccine''. The vaccine is injected into the body to stimulate the normal immune system to produce antibodies that are directed against pneumococcus bacteria.''This method of stimulating the normal immune system to be directed against a specific microbe is called immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination is also referred to as pneumococcal immunization.''Pneumococcal vaccination does not protect against ''pneumonia'' caused by microbes other than pneumococcus bacteria, nor does it protect against pneumococcal bacterial ''strains'' not included in the vaccine. It is reassuring to note that of the 80 different serotypes, the vast majority of infections are caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine.''In children, especially under 2 years of age, a special conjugated vaccine has been developed to stimulate less developed immune systems. Originally only covering seven serotypes, the newer vaccine released in 2010 now covers 13 serotypes of the pneumococcus (''Prevnar 13'').' "
Who should consider pneumococcal vaccination?,"'Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered by people in the following groups:' Adults 65 years of age and older People > 2 years of age with chronic heart or lung disorders, including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, alcoholism, spinal fluid leaks, cardiomyopathy, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or emphysema People > 2 years of age with spleen dysfunction (such as sickle cell disease) or lack of spleen function (asplenia), blood malignancy (leukemias), multiple myeloma, kidney failure, organ transplantation, or immunosuppressive conditions, including HIV infection Alaskan natives and certain American Indian populations If elective surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or immunosuppressive therapy is planned, the vaccine is given two weeks prior to the procedure, if possible."
Who should not receive pneumococcal vaccine? What about pregnancy?,"'The ''pneumococcal vaccine'' should not be received by people with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine.''The safety of the pneumococcus vaccine for ''pregnant'' women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before ''becoming pregnant'', if possible.' "
What are side effects of pneumococcal vaccine?,"'Pneumococcal vaccine uncommonly causes side effects. Reported side effects include''The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, ''fatigue'', ''headache'', ''chills'', and diffuse achiness.'   soreness and/or redness at the site of the injection, fever, rash, and allergic reactions."
How is pneumococcal vaccine administered?,"'The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a single injection in adults. The vaccine is injected as a liquid solution of 0.5 mL into the muscle (intramuscular or IM), typically deltoid muscle, or under the skin (subcutaneous or SC). The area injected is typically disinfected by rubbing ''alcohol'' onto the skin prior to the injection. The conjugated Prevnar 13 vaccine is given as a series of four injections in children.''People vaccinated prior to age 65 should be vaccinated at age 65 if five or more years have passed since the first dose. For people with a lack of spleen function (such as in sickle cell disease or after spleen removal), transplant patients, patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', immunosuppressed or immunodeficient people, and others at highest risk of fatal infection, a second dose should be given at least five years after first dose.' "
What if it is not clear what a person's vaccination history is?,"'When indicated, ''vaccines'' should be administered to patients with unknown vaccination status. All residents of ''nursing'' homes and other long-term care facilities should have their vaccination status assessed and documented.''Inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine and ''tetanus'' ''vaccines'' may be given at the same time as or at any time before or after a dose of pneumococcus vaccine. There are no requirements to wait between the doses of these or any other inactivated ''vaccines''.''In July 2000, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and the CDC jointly recommended childhood pneumococcal immunization, since pneumococcal infections are the most common invasive ''bacterial infections'' in children in the United States.''""The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, all adults 65 years or older, and persons 6 through 64 years of age with certain medical conditions,"" according to the 2014 AAP/CDC guidelines.

What are the current recommendations for administration of pneumococcal vaccine in healthy adults?,"   Patients who are healthy and have never received the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine (PPSV23), if equal to or older than 65 years of age, should receive the PCV13 first and then within six months to a one year receive the PPSV23. Those who have already received the PPSV23, should get the PCV13 about one year later. If the person received the PPSV23 over five years earlier, they essentially should be treated as if they never received the vaccine, getting the PCV13 injection, followed about six to 13 months later by the PPSV23.

What is pneumonia?,"'Pneumonia is an inflammation of the airspaces (alveoli; singular alveolus) in the lung most commonly caused by infections. Bacteria, viruses, or fungi (infrequently) can cause the infection. There are also a few noninfectious types of pneumonia that are caused by inhaling or aspirating foreign matter or toxic substances into the lungs.''Some cases of pneumonia are life-threatening. Around 50,000 people die each year of pneumonia in the U.S. Although anyone of any age can be affected, pneumonia is more common in elderly people and often occurs when the immune system becomes weakened via a prior infection or another condition.''Pneumonia is generally more serious when it affects older adults, infants and young children, those with chronic medical conditions, or those with weakened immune function.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of pneumonia ?,"""Symptoms and signs of pneumonia may be mild or severe and depend upon someone's overall state of health as well as the type of organism causing the pneumonia. Severe symptoms of pneumonia include""'Nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea'' are other possible symptoms that can accompany the respiratory symptoms.''Infants and newborns may not show specific symptoms of pneumonia. Instead, the baby or child may appear restless or lethargic. A baby or child with pneumonia may also have a fever or cough or vomit. Older adults or those who have weak immune systems may also have fewer symptoms and a lower temperature. A change in mental status, such as ''confusion'', can develop in older adults with pneumonia.'

   cough, chest pain when breathing or coughing, labored breathing or shortness of breath, coughing up phlegm, fever, chills, and fatigue."
When do the symptoms and signs of pneumonia start?,"'The incubation period for pneumonia depends on the type of organism causing the disease, as well as characteristics of the patient, such as his or her age and overall health status. Most cases of pneumonia begin with symptoms similar to those of a ''cold'' or the ''flu'' that last longer than the flu (about seven to 10 days) and become more severe. The symptoms of pneumonia can occur from a few days to a week following the ''flu-like symptoms''.' "
What are the types of pneumonia? ,"'Sometimes, types of pneumonia are referred to by the type of organism that causes the inflammation, such as bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or fungal pneumonia. The specific organism name may also be used to describe the types of pneumonia, such as pneumococcal (''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'') pneumonia or ''Legionella'' pneumonia.''Other types of pneumonia that are commonly referenced include the following:' Aspiration pneumonia develops as a result of inhaling food or drink, saliva, or vomit into the lungs. This occurs when the swallowing reflex is impaired, such as with brain injury or in an intoxicated person. Several types of bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cause atypical pneumonia. It is sometimes called ""walking pneumonia"" and is referred to as atypical because its symptoms differ from those of other types of bacterial pneumonia. Pneumonia that arises from being on a ventilator for respiratory support in the intensive care setting is known as ventilator-associated pneumonia."
What are the stages of pneumonia?,"'Pneumonia can be classified or characterized in different ways. Health care professionals often refer to pneumonia based upon the way that the infection is acquired, such as community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.''Other classification systems for pneumonia describe the way the inflammatory cells infiltrate the lung tissue or the appearance of the affected tissue (see the following examples).' Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as the name implies, is a respiratory infection of the lung that develops outside of the hospital or health care environment. It is more common than hospital-acquired pneumonia. CAP is most common in winter and affects about 4 million people a year in the U.S. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is acquired when an individual is already hospitalized for another condition. HAP is generally more serious because it develops in ill patients already hospitalized or under medical care for another condition. Being on a ventilator for respiratory support increases the risk of acquiring HAP. Health care-associated pneumonia is acquired from other health care settings, like kidney dialysis centers, outpatient clinics, or nursing homes. Bronchopneumonia causes scattered, patchy infiltrates of inflammation in the air sacs throughout the lungs. It is more diffuse than lobar pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia causes an inflammation of one lobe of a lung and typically involves all the airspaces in a single lobe. Lipoid pneumonia is characterized by the accumulation of fats within the airspaces. It can be caused by aspiration of oils or associated with airway obstruction."
Is pneumonia contagious?,"'Most types of bacterial pneumonia are not highly contagious. Even though it is possible to spread bacteria from one person to another, pneumonia typically occurs in people with risk factors or weakened immune defenses when bacteria that are normally present in the nose or throat invade the lung tissue. Any kind of bacterial or viral pneumonia has the potential to be contagious, but ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' and ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'' (the cause of tuberculosis) are two types of bacterial pneumonia that are highly contagious. Breathing in infected droplets that come from patients who are coughing or ''sneezing'' can spread the disease to others.' "
How long is pneumonia contagious?,"'It is impossible to say with certainty exactly how long an adult or child with pneumonia is contagious, since this varies according to the type of germ or organism that caused the pneumonia. This contagious period can range from one to two days to weeks. In general, while an infected person is coughing or sneezing, there is the potential to release contaminated droplets into the air.''Many bacterial pneumonias are much less contagious after antibiotics have been taken for about 24-48 hours. However, this time period may vary for some organisms. For example, with tuberculosis, it can take two weeks or more of antibiotics before the person is no longer contagious. With viral pneumonias, the patient becomes less contagious after the symptoms have improved, especially fever. Some people with viral pneumonia may not be contagious after one to two days with no fever, but others may still shed some infectious virus particles for a much longer time.' "
What causes pneumonia?,"'Streptococcus pneumoniae'', a type of bacteria, is the most common cause of pneumonia. ''Legionella pneumophila'' is the bacterial type that causes the pneumonia known as Legionnaires\' disease. Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called ""atypical"" pneumonia, ''Legionella pneumophila'', ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', and ''Chlamydophila pneumonia''. ''Haemophilus influenzae'' is a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia. It most commonly causes disease in ''babies'' and children younger than 5 years of age. Adults 65 years or older, American Indians, and Alaska Natives are also at increased risk for developing ''H. influenzae'' disease.''The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present. Influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), however, may cause serious problems in some patients. Other virus types that can cause pneumonia include ''measles'' and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox'') viruses. Rarely, certain viruses may cause lethal pneumonias such as ''SARS'' (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'') or ''MERS'' (''Middle East respiratory syndrome''); both diseases are caused by different coronaviruses.''Fungi that cause pneumonia include ''Cryptococcus'', ''Histoplasma'', and ''Coccidioides'"". In most individuals, these organisms don't cause illness, but they can cause pneumonia in some people. ""'Fungal infections'' are most common in those with weakened immune systems due to ''HIV/AIDS'' or those taking medications that suppress immune function. Another infection that is considered a fungal type of pneumonia is ''Pneumocystis jirovecii'', formerly known as ''Pneumocystis carinii''. This organism became known as a frequent cause of pneumonia in patients with ''HIV/AIDS''.''The emphasis of this article is the more common causes of infectious pneumonias, but there are others that may be caused by noninfectious lung irritants like ''inhalation'' of chemicals, foods, gasses, liquids, and/or dust.'

What are risk factors for pneumonia?,"'There are a number of factors that increase the risk of developing pneumonia. These include' a weakened immune system, either due to disease such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, or to medications that suppress immune function; infants and children 2 years of age or younger; age 65 and older; having a chronic disease such as pulmonary disease (including cystic fibrosis and COPD), sickle cell anemia, asthma, heart disease, or diabetes; swallowing or coughing problems, as may occur following stroke or other brain injury; being a patient in an intensive care unit of a hospital, particularly if on ventilator support; malnutrition; and cigarette smoking."
How long does pneumonia last?,"'The duration of symptoms varies according to the type of pneumonia and the underlying health status of the individual. In previously healthy people, pneumonia can be a mild illness that resolves within two to three weeks. In older adults and in those with chronic diseases or other health problems, recovery may take six to eight weeks or longer.' "
What tests diagnose pneumonia?,"'The diagnosis of pneumonia always begins with taking a medical history and performing a physical examination to look for characteristic signs. In particular, listening to the lungs may reveal areas where sound is diminished, ''wheezing'', or crackling sounds in affected areas. Some commonly performed diagnostic tests are as follows:' A chest X-ray is able to illustrate whether or not pneumonia is present, but it does not provide information about the organism responsible for the infection. In some cases, a chest CT scan may be performed. This will reveal more detail than the chest X-ray. Pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream. The test involves a painless sensor attached to the finger or ear. Blood levels of oxygen may be reduced in pneumonia. Microbiology tests to identify the causative organism. Tests may be performed on blood or sputum. Rapid urine tests are available to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Cultures of blood or sputum not only identify the responsible organism but can also be examined to determine which antibiotics are effective against a particular bacterial strain. Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a thin, lighted tube is inserted into the trachea and major airways. This allows the doctor to visualize the inside of the airways and take tissue samples if needed. Bronchoscopy may be performed in patients with severe pneumonia or if pneumonia worsens despite antibiotic treatment."
What is the treatment for pneumonia?,"'Antibiotic medications are the treatment of choice for pneumonia caused by bacterial and fungal infections. The exact choice of medications depends on many factors, including the following:''About 80% of cases of CAP can be managed at home with the patient taking oral antibiotics. There are numerous treatment regimens available. Initial treatment (before the causative organism has been identified) is called empiric treatment and is based upon the organisms most likely to be responsible for the illness. Once the exact organism has been identified in the laboratory and susceptibility testing performed to determine which antibiotics are effective, the treatment regimen can be further individualized. ''Over-the-counter'' ''pain'' and fever-reducing medications may be recommended for some people in addition to antibiotics or antiviral ''drugs'"" for symptom relief. Do not take cough or cold medications when suffering from pneumonia without a doctor's approval.""'In around 20% of cases, CAP must be managed in the hospital, typically with intravenous antibiotics initially. HAP care is managed in the hospital, typically with intravenous antibiotics.''Antibiotics are not effective against viral pneumonia. Depending upon the type of virus that causes pneumonia, antiviral medications can provide benefit when started early in the course of the disease. For example, the medications ''oseltamivir'' (''Tamiflu'') and ''zanamivir'' (''Relenza'') are used to treat influenza virus infections. Antifungal agents are used to treat most fungal pneumonias.'

Which types of doctors treat pneumonia?,"'In some cases, primary care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, and family medicine specialists, may manage the care for patients with pneumonia. In more severe cases, other types of specialists may be involved in treating the patient with pneumonia. These include infectious-disease specialists, pulmonologists, critical care specialists, and hospitalists.' "
What are complications of pneumonia?,"'There are a number of potential complications of pneumonia. The infection that causes pneumonia can spread to the bloodstream, causing ''sepsis''. Sepsis is a serious condition that can result in lowering of ''blood pressure'' and failure of oxygen to reach the tissues of the body, resulting in the need for intensive care management. Another complication is the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lung tissue and the chest wall lining, known as a ''pleural effusion''. The organisms responsible for the pneumonia may infect the fluid in a pleural effusion, known as an empyema. Pneumonia can also result in the formation of an ''abscess'' (collection of pus) within the lungs or airways.' "
What is the prognosis and recovery time of pneumonia? Can you die?,"'Most people with pneumonia improve after three to five days of antibiotic treatment, but a mild cough and ''fatigue'' can last longer, up to a month. Patients who required treatment in a hospital may take longer to see improvement.''Pneumonia can also be fatal. The mortality (death) rate is up to 30% for patients with severe pneumonia who require treatment in an intensive care unit. Overall, around 5%-10% of patients who are treated in a hospital setting die from the disease. Pneumonia is more likely to be fatal in the elderly or those with chronic medical conditions or a weakened immune system.' "
Can the pneumonia vaccine prevent pneumonia?,"'It is not possible to prevent all types of pneumonia, but one can take steps to reduce the chance of contracting the condition by quitting ''smoking'', practicing good hand-washing, and avoiding contact with people who have colds, the flu, or other infections.''A ''vaccine'' is available against the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia, ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' (also known as ''Pneumococcus''). There are two types of vaccine: PPSV23 (Pneumovax), a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine against 23 types of the bacteria, and PCV13 (''Prevnar 13''), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that protects against 13 types of the bacteria. These ''vaccines'' may not always prevent pneumococcal pneumonia, but they may prevent serious complications of pneumonia if it does occur.''Avoidance of areas where fungal pathogens are endemic is recommended to prevent fungal pneumonias. There is no antifungal vaccine available; however, for some high-risk patients, some doctors have recommended prophylactic antifungal drugs.'  "
Are side effects associated with the pneumonia vaccine?,"'Side effects of PCV13 in children include drowsiness, temporary ''loss of appetite'', or redness, swelling, or tenderness where the shot was given. Mild fever and irritability are other common side effects. Adults receiving pneumococcal ''vaccines'' have reported ''pain'', redness, ''rash'', and swelling where the shot was given; also mild fever, fatigue, ''headache'', chills, or ''muscle pain''.''Any type of vaccine has the potential to cause an ''allergic reaction'', which can be severe, but this side effect is rare. This would happen within minutes to a few hours after receiving the vaccine.' "
How many pneumonia vaccines do you need?,"'PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 2 years of age, all adults 65 years of age or older, and people 2-64 years of age with certain medical conditions.''PPSV23 is currently recommended for all adults 65 years of age or older and for people who are 2 years of age or older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (for example, those with ''sickle cell disease'', ''HIV'' infection, or other immunocompromising conditions). PPSV23 is also recommended for use in adults 19-64 years of age who smoke cigarettes.''There is no evidence about the safety of PCV13 or PPSV23 vaccine use in ''pregnancy''. Women who need the vaccine should be vaccinated before a pregnancy, if possible.''Some people may be recommended to receive both the PCV13 and PPSV23 ''vaccines''. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends two pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older. The PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be given at the same time. When both vaccines are recommended, a dose of the PCV13 should be given first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at another visit to a health care provider.''Seasonal influenza vaccines are available yearly and are recommended to decrease the chance of contracting influenza. Vaccines against the ''measles'' virus and varicella virus, two viruses that can also cause pneumonia, are also available. The common side effects of these vaccines are similar to those listed below for the pneumonia vaccine.' "
What is a pneumothorax?,'A pneumothorax is a collection of free air in the chest outside the lung that causes the lung to collapse.' 
What is tension pneumothorax?,"'In some instances, the lung continues to leak air into the chest cavity and results in compression of the chest structures, including vessels that return blood to the ''heart''. This is referred to as a ''tension pneumothorax'' and can be fatal if not treated immediately.' "
What are the types of pneumothorax?,"   A spontaneous pneumothorax, also referred to as a primary pneumothorax, occurs in the absence of a traumatic injury to the chest or a known lung disease. A secondary (also termed complicated) pneumothorax occurs due to an underlying condition."
What are the signs and symptoms of pneumothorax?,"'Symptoms of a pneumothorax include''The skin may develop a bluish color (termed ''cyanosis'') due to decreases in blood oxygen levels.'   chest pain that usually has a sudden onset. The pain is sharp and may lead to feelings of tightness in the chest. Shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, cough, and fatigue are other symptoms of pneumothorax."
What causes pneumothorax?,"'The ''lungs'' normally inflate by increasing the size of the chest cavity, resulting in a negative (vacuum) pressure in the pleural space (the area within the chest cavity but outside the lungs). If air enters the pleural space either by a hole in the lung or the chest wall, the pressure in the pleural space equals the pressure outside the body. Thus, the vacuum is lost and the lung collapses.''Spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by a rupture of a ''cyst'' or a small sac (bleb) on the surface of the lung. Pneumothorax may also occur following an injury to the chest wall such as a fractured rib, any penetrating injury (gunshot or stabbing), surgical invasion of the chest, or may be deliberately induced in order to collapse the lung. A pneumothorax can also develop as a result of underlying lung diseases, including' cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, asthma, and infections of the lungs."
How is pneumothorax diagnosed?,'Examination of the chest with a stethoscope reveals decreased or absent breath sounds over the affected lung. The diagnosis is confirmed by ''chest X-ray''.' 
What is the treatment for pneumothorax?,"   A small pneumothorax without underlying lung disease may resolve on its own in one to two weeks. A larger pneumothorax and a pneumothorax associated with underlying lung disease often require aspiration of the free air and/or placement of a chest tube to evacuate the air. Possible complications of chest tube insertion includepain,infection of the space between the lung and chest wall (the pleural space),hemorrhage (bleeding),fluid accumulation in the lung, andlow blood pressure (hypotension). pain, infection of the space between the lung and chest wall (the pleural space), hemorrhage (bleeding), fluid accumulation in the lung, and low blood pressure (hypotension). In some cases, the leak does not close on its own. This is called a bronchopleural fistula (punctured lung), and may require chest surgery to repair the hole in the lung."
Who is at risk for pneumothorax?,'Spontaneous pneumothorax is more common in men. ''Smoking'' has been shown to increase the risk for spontaneous pneumothorax.' 
What is the prognosis for pneumothorax?,'The outcome of pneumothorax depends upon the extent and type of pneumothorax.' A small spontaneous pneumothorax will generally resolve on its own without treatment. A secondary pneumothorax (even when small) associated with underlying disease is much more serious and has a significant death rate. A secondary pneumothorax requires urgent and immediate treatment. Having one pneumothorax increases the risk of developing the condition again. Most recurrences occur within the first year.
What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?,"""Health care providers use the term POI when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40 years of age.""'1,2''''Many women naturally experience reduced ''fertility'' when they are around 40 years old. This age may mark the start of irregular menstrual periods that signal the onset of ''menopause''. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility occur before the age of 40, sometimes as early as the teenage years.''3,4''''In the past, POI used to be called ""''premature menopause''"" or ""premature ovarian failure,"" but those terms do not accurately describe what happens in a woman with POI. A woman who has gone through ''menopause'' will never have another normal period and cannot get ''pregnant''. A woman with POI may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly, and she may still get pregnant.''2,4' "
What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'The first sign of POI is usually menstrual irregularities or missed periods,''2'' which is sometimes called ''amenorrhea'' (pronounced ey-men-uh-REE-uh or uh-men-uh-REE-uh).''In addition, some women with POI have symptoms similar to those experienced by women who are going through ''natural menopause'', including:''For many women with POI, trouble ''getting pregnant'' or ''infertility'' is the first symptom they experience and is what leads them to visit their health care provider. This is sometimes called ""occult"" (hidden) or early POI.''6' Hot flashes Night sweats Irritability Poor concentration Decreased sex drive Pain during sex Vaginal dryness1,5"
How many women are affected by or at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'Estimates suggest that about 1% of women and teenage girls in the United States have POI.''1'' Researchers estimate that, categorized by age, POI affects:'""Several factors can affect a woman's risk for POI:"" 1 in 10,000 women by age 20 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 1 in 250 women by age 35 1 in 100 women by age 408 Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have the disorder. About 10% to 20% of women with POI have a family history of the condition.8 Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. Research suggests that these disorders and conditions cause as much as 28% of POI cases.9 For example:
Women who carry a variation of the gene for Fragile X syndrome are at higher risk for Fragile X-Associated POI (FXPOI). 10 Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual and developmental disability, but women with FXPOI do not have Fragile X syndrome itself. Instead, they have a change or mutation in the same gene that causes Fragile X syndrome, and this change is linked to FXPOI. 
Most women who have Turner syndrome develop POI. Turner syndrome is a condition in which a girl or woman is partially or completely missing an X chromosome. Most women are XX, meaning they have two X chromosomes. Women with Turner syndrome are X0, meaning one of the X chromosomes is missing.

Autoimmune diseases, viral infections, chemotherapy, and other treatments also may put a woman at higher risk of POI.8"
What causes primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is a mystery.''4,6,11''Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles (pronounced FOL-i-kulz)—the small sacs in the ovaries in which eggs grow and mature.''6''Follicles start out as microscopic seeds called primordial (pronounced prahy-MAWR-dee-uhl) follicles. These seeds are not yet follicles, but they can grow into them. Normally, a woman is born with approximately 2 million primordial follicles,''12'' typically enough to last until she goes through natural ''menopause'', usually around age 50.''4''For a woman with POI, there are problems with the follicles:''1''Although the exact cause is unknown in a majority of cases, some causes of follicle depletion and dysfunction have been identified:' Follicle depletion. A woman with follicle depletion runs out of working follicles earlier than normal or expected. In the case of POI, the woman runs out of working follicles before natural menopause occurs around age 50. Presently there is no safe way for scientists today to make primordial follicles. Follicle dysfunction. A woman with follicle dysfunction has follicles remaining in her ovaries, but the follicles are not working properly. Scientists do not have a safe and effective way to make follicles start working normally again.6 Genetic and chromosomal disorders. Disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome can cause follicle depletion.6,8,12 Low number of follicles. Some women are born with fewer primordial follicles, so they have a smaller pool of follicles to use throughout their lives. Even though only one mature follicle releases an egg each month, less mature follicles usually develop along with that mature follicle and egg. Scientists don't understand exactly why this happens, but these ""supporting"" follicles seem to help the mature follicle function normally. If these extra follicles are missing, the main follicle will not mature and release an egg properly. Autoimmune diseases. Typically, the body's immune cells protect the body from invading bacteria and viruses. However, in autoimmune diseases, immune cells turn on healthy tissue. In the case of POI, the immune system may damage developing follicles in the ovaries. It could also damage the glands that make the hormones needed for the ovaries and follicles to work properly. Recent studies suggest that about 20% of women with POI have an autoimmune disease.4,13
Thyroiditis (pronounced thahy-roi-DAHY-tis) is the autoimmune disorder most commonly associated with POI.13 It is an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which makes hormones that control metabolism, or the pace of body processes.
Addison's disease is also associated with POI. Addison's disease affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that help the body respond to physical stress, such as illness and injury; the hormones also affect ovary function.14 About 3% of women with POI have Addison's disease.15

These strong treatments for cancer may damage the genetic material in cells, including follicle cells.2,6,11 Metabolic disorders. These disorders affect the body's ability to create, store, and use the energy it needs. For example, galactosemia (pronounced guh-lak-tuh-SEE-mee-uh) affects how your body processes galactose (guh-LAK-tohs), a type of sugar. More than 80% of women and girls with galactosemia also have POI.13 Toxins. Cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticides can speed up follicle depletion. In addition, viruses have been shown to affect follicle function.4,12"
How is primary ovarian insufficiency diagnosed?,"'The key signs of POI are:''If a woman is younger than age 40 and begins having irregular periods or stops having periods for 4 months or longer, her health care provider may take these steps to diagnose the problem:'""The health care provider will also ask questions about a woman's medical history. He or she may ask about:""'If they do not do tests to rule out POI, some health care providers might assume missed periods are related to ''stress''.''4'' However, this approach is problematic because it will lead to a delay in diagnosis; further evaluation is needed.''4' Missed or irregular periods for 4 months, typically after having had regular periods for a while High levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Low levels of estrogen4,6,13 Do a 
	pregnancy test. This test will rule out an unexpected pregnancy as the reason for 
	missed 
	periods.4 Do a physical exam. During the physical exam, the health care provider looks for signs of other disorders. In some cases, the presence of these other disorders will rule out POI. Or, if the other disorders are associated with POI, such as Addison's disease, a health care provider will know that POI may be present.4 Collect blood. The health care provider will collect your blood and send it to a lab, where a technician will run several tests, including:
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) test. FSH signals the ovaries to make estrogen, sometimes called the ""female hormone"" because women need high levels of it for fertility and overall health. If the ovaries are not working properly, as is the case in POI, the level of FSH in the blood increases. The health care provider may do two FSH tests, at least a month apart. If the FSH level in both tests is as high as it is in women who have gone through menopause, then POI is likely.4
Luteinizing (pronounced LOO-tee-uh-nahyz-ing) hormone (LH) test. LH signals a mature follicle to release an egg. Women with POI have high LH levels, more evidence that the follicles are not functioning normally.1
Estrogen test. In women with POI, estrogen levels are usually low, because the ovaries are not functioning properly in their role as estrogen producers.1,6
Karyotype (pronounced KAR-ee-uh-tahyp) test. This test looks at all 46 of your chromosomes to check for abnormalities. The karyotype test could reveal genetic changes in the structure of chromosomes that might be associated with POI and other health problems.1,4

A sonogram can show whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles.4,11 A blood relative with POI or its symptoms A blood relative with Fragile X syndrome or an unidentified intellectual or developmental disability Ovarian surgery Radiation or chemotherapy treatment Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or other 
	sexually transmitted infections An endocrine disorder, such as diabetes4"
Are there associated disorders or conditions associated with primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'Because POI results in lower levels of certain hormones, women with POI are at greater risk for a number of health conditions, including:'""Addison's disease is also associated with POI. Addison's disease is a life-threatening condition that affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that help the body respond to physical stress, such as illness and injury. These hormones also affect ovary function.""'14'"" About 3% of women with POI have Addison's disease.""'15' Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break and fracture.1 Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism (pronounced hahy-puh-THAHY-roi-diz-uhm). The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels of the hormones made by the thyroid can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy and mental sluggishness. 
	Cold feet and constipation are also features of low thyroid function. Researchers estimate that between 14% and 27% of women with POI also have low thyroid function.4 Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.16 Women diagnosed with POI can be shy, anxious in social settings, and may have low self-esteem more often than women without POI.4 It is possible that depression may contribute to POI.16 Cardiovascular (heart) disease. Lower levels of estrogen, as seen in POI, can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. Both factors increase the risk of atherosclerosis (pronounced ath-uh-roh-skluh-ROH-sis) - or hardening of the arteries - which can slow or block the flow of blood to the heart. Women with POI have higher rates of illness and death from heart disease than do women without POI.1,6,11 Dry eye syndrome and ocular (eye) surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these conditions, which cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision.4 If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage."
What are the treatments for primary ovarian insufficiency?,"""Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.""'1,2'' But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI, as well as treatments and behaviors to reduce health risks and conditions associated with POI.''It is also important to note that between 5% and 10% of women with POI get pregnant without medical intervention after they are diagnosed with POI. Some research suggests that these women go into what is known as ""spontaneous remission"" of POI, meaning that the ovaries begin to function normally on their own. When the ovaries are working properly, fertility is restored and the women can get pregnant.' "
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),"'HRT'' is the most common treatment for women with POI. It gives the body the estrogen and other hormones that the ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for ''cardiovascular disease'' (including heart attacks, ''stroke'', and ''high blood pressure'') and ''osteoporosis''.''17''''If a woman with POI begins HRT, she is expected to start having regular periods again. In addition, HRT is expected to reduce other symptoms, such as ''hot flashes'' and night sweats, and help maintain bone health.''1,13,17,26'' HRT will not prevent pregnancy, and evidence suggests it might improve pregnancy rates for women with POI by lowering high levels of luteinizing hormone - which stimulates ''ovulation'' - to normal in some women.''19''''HRT is usually a combination of an estrogen and a progestin. A progestin is a form of ''progesterone''. Sometimes, the combination might also include testosterone, although this approach is controversial.''11'' HRT comes in several forms: pills, creams, gels, patches that stick onto the skin, an ''intrauterine device'', or a vaginal ring.''14'' ''Estradiol'' is the natural form of human estrogen. The optimal method of providing estradiol to women with POI is by a skin patch or vaginal ring. These methods are linked with a lower risk of potentially fatal ''blood clots'' developing. Most women require a dose of 100 micrograms of estradiol per day. It is important to take a progestin along with estradiol to balance out the effect of estrogen on the lining of the womb. Women who do not take a progestin along with estradiol are at increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer''. The progestin with the best evidence available to support use in women with POI is 10 mg of''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate by mouth per day for the first 12 calendar days of each month.''A health care provider may suggest that a woman with POI take HRT until she is about 50 years old, the age at which menopause usually begins.''After that time, she should talk with her health care provider about stopping the treatment because of risks associated with using this type of therapy in the years after the normal age of menopause.''4'""In general, HRT treatment for women with POI is safe and is associated with only minimal side effects. Women with POI take HRT to replace hormones their bodies would normally be making if they didn't have POI.""'The HRT taken by women with POI is different from the hormone therapies taken by women who are going through or have gone through natural menopause, which are often called menopausal or post-menopausal ''hormone therapy'' (PMHT).''A large, long-term study - called the '""Women's Health""' Initiative - examined the effects of a specific type of PMHT, taken for more than 5 years, by women ages 50 to 79 who had already gone through menopause. This study showed that PMHT was associated with an increased risk of ''stroke'', blood clots, ''heart disease'', heart attacks, and ''breast cancer'' in these women.''20''These results do not apply to young women with POI who take HRT.''4,14'' The type and amount of HRT prescribed to women with POI is different from the PMHT taken by older women.''4''A woman should talk to her health care provider if she has questions about HRT as a treatment for POI. Also, she should tell her health care provider about any side effects she experiences while taking HRT. There are many different types of HRT. Women should work with their health care providers to find out the best type of treatment.' "
Calcium and vitamin D supplements,"'Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, they should get at least 1,200 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium and 1000 IU (international units) of ''vitamin D'', which helps the body absorb calcium, every day.''21'' These nutrients are important for bone health.''14'' A health care provider may do a ''bone mineral density'' test to check for bone loss.''19' "
Regular physical activity and healthy body weight,"'Weight-bearing physical activity, such as ''walking'', jogging, and stair climbing, helps build bone strength and prevents osteoporosis.''14'' Maintaining a healthy body weight and getting regular physical activity are also important for reducing the risk of ''heart disease''. These factors can affect ''cholesterol levels'', which in turn can change the risk for heart disease.''22' "
Treatments for associated conditions,"""POI is associated with other health conditions, including (but not limited to) Addison's disease,Fragile X permutation, thyroid dysfunction, ""'depression'', ''anxiety'', and certain other genetic, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders.''Women who have POI as well as one of these associated conditions will require additional treatment for the associated condition. In some cases, treatment involves medication or hormone therapy. Other types of treatments might also be needed.' "
Emotional support,"'For many women who experience ''infertility'', including those with POI, feelings of loss are common. In one study, almost 9 out of 10 women reported feeling moderate to severe emotional distress when they learned of their POI diagnosis.''14, 26''\u200b Several organizations offer help finding these types of professionals. ' "
POI in teens,"'Receiving a diagnosis of POI can be emotionally difficult for teenagers and their parents. A teen may have a similar emotional experience as an adult who receives the diagnosis, but there are many aspects of the experience that are unique to being a teenager. It is important for parents, the teenager, and health care providers to work closely together to ensure that the teenager gets the right treatment and maintains her emotional and physical health in the long term. There are resources to provide advice and support for parents, teenagers, and health care providers.''25'' ' "

What is poison ivy?,"'Poison ivy'' (''Toxicodendron'' spp.) is a plant native to North America. The ivy is a climbing vine related to the cashew family. ''Poison ivy'' produces an oily chemical (urushiol) onto the surface of its leaves. When people come in contact with poison ivy, the urushiol can cause an ''allergic'' skin reaction that produces reddish, itchy, and painful inflammation of the skin (''dermatitis''). Close relatives of poison ivy plants that produce similar dermatitis symptoms are ''poison oak'' and ''poison sumac''. In addition, mangoes and Japanese lacquer trees also can produce urushiol.' "
Is poison ivy contagious?,"'The poison ivy ''rash'' is an ''allergic reaction'"" to an oily chemical from the leaf surface. This is an individual's allergic response to the chemical and is therefore not considered to be ""'contagious'"". However, if a person comes in contact with the oily chemical from an affected patient's skin or clothing, then the urushiol could be passed on and a poison ivy ""'rash'' may develop in a second individual. Direct contact with the oily chemical causes the symptoms and signs attributed to poison ivy.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis?,"'Symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis are as follows:''More serious symptoms may include the following:''Cortisone preparations and ''antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax, ''Vistaril''), or ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'') may help reduce the symptoms and signs.' Localized mild skin redness (erythema) Itchy skin Diffuse skin redness Edema Severe pain and/or itching Blister (bullous) skin lesions Secondary skin infections"
What is the incubation period for a poison ivy rash?,"""Dermatologists suggest that the first exposure to poison ivy has an incubation period of about five to 21 days before the rash appears. However, repeated exposure to poison ivy results in the rash appearing more quickly (about 12-48 hours). The diagnosis made with the patient's history and physical exam and usually requires no further tests. Consequently, the diagnosis is made by likely exposure to poison ivy and the appearance of the rash symptoms and signs described above."" "
Is it possible for a poison ivy rash to spread?,"""Poison ivy is not contagious and is not spread like an infectious disease from person to person. However, it can spread if the oily chemical on one person's skin is touched by another person. Even if the oil is on a person's skin or clothing, anyone who comes in contact with the irritant may develop symptoms. In addition, if the person who has poison ivy touches clothing or other areas of his body that has the irritant on the skin surface, they can spread the irritant to other parts of their own body. Consequently, it is very important to clean off the skin and clothing that has been exposed to the oil and to not scratch or touch the developing rash area if it has not been cleaned off as the person could transfer oil to the eyes, mouth, or other areas of the body. Showering with warm soapy water helps to remove the oil and can reduce the chance of any spread. Washing the exposed area within 20 minutes after exposure reduces the symptoms and signs of poison ivy rash."" "
How long does a poison ivy rash last?,"""Most individuals with poison ivy will have the rash and other symptoms and signs gradually resolve over a period of about one to three weeks. Dermatologists recommend immediately rinsing or showering the skin with lukewarm soapy water to remove the oily chemical responsible for the symptoms. This can reduce or eliminate the chance of spread to other areas of the body or to other individuals who may otherwise contact the irritant on an individual's skin. In addition, thoroughly washing clothing that may be exposed to the oily chemical is key to prevention of the spread of poison ivy. Once the oily irritant is removed, spread of the rash is prevented, although ""'itching'' and some ''pain'' may take a few days to fade.' "
When should someone seek medical care for a poison ivy rash?,"'Individuals with a poison ivy rash usually do not require medical care and have the symptoms resolve in about one to three weeks. Home care may include cool showers, cool compresses, ''calamine lotion'', and/or hydrocortisone cream. If any ''blisters'' develop, simply leave them alone and do not scratch the irritated skin area.''However some patients may be very sensitive or allergic to the oily chemical produced by poison ivy. If any of the following symptoms or signs develop after contacting the irritant produced by poison ivy, the individual should seek immediate medical care:'  Difficulty with breathing or trouble swallowing Swelling, especially around the eyes Fever A rash develops on the face and/or genitalia. A rash covers most of an individual's body. Nothing relieves the discomfort (itching, pain) of the rash."
"What are poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac?","'Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac (belonging to the ''Anacardiaceae'' family) are plants that can cause a rash if individuals come in contact with the oily resin found in them.''Poison ivy'' (''Toxicodendron radicans'' -- eastern poison ivy/''Toxicodendron rydbergii'' -- western poison ivy) typically grows as a vine or shrub, and it can be found throughout much of North America (except in the desert, Alaska, and Hawaii). It grows in open fields, wooded areas, on the roadside, and along riverbanks. It can also be found in urban areas, such as parks or backyards. Poison ivy plants typically have leaf arrangements that are clustered in groups of three leaflets (trifoiate), though this can vary. The color and shape of the leaves may also vary depending upon the exact species, the local environment, and the time of year. The plant may have yellow or green flowers, and white to green-yellow berries, depending on the season. Eastern poison ivy typically grows as a hairy ropelike vine, whereas western poison ivy tends to grow as a low shrub.''Poison oak'' (''Toxicodendron diversilobum'') grows as a vine or shrub, and it is found in the western United States and British Columbia. It also has a leaf arrangement similar to poison ivy, with clusters of three leaflets. The leaves may sometimes resemble true oak leaves.''Poison sumac'' (''Toxicodendron vernix'') grows as a shrub or small tree, and it is found in the eastern/southeastern United States. It grows in very wet areas, and it can be found along the banks of the Mississippi River. Each stem contains seven to 13 leaves arranged in pairs. It has the potential to cause a more severe rash than either poison ivy or poison oak.'

"What causes a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Exposure to all of these plants can produce a rash, which is caused by sensitivity to an oily resin found in these plants called urushiol. This substance can be found on the leaves, stems, flowers, and roots of these plants. Interestingly, it can remain active even after the plant has died. Exposure to even very small amounts of urushiol, amounts less than a grain of table salt, will lead to the development of a rash in 80%-90% of individuals.''The rash (an ''allergic contact dermatitis'"") can be caused by direct contact with urushiol by touching the plants or by indirect contact with the plant oil that may have contaminated a pet's fur, tools, clothing, or other surfaces. Airborne contact is also possible if these plants are burned and the urushiol particles land on the skin, and it can affect the ""'lungs'' as well if the urushiol is inhaled. In the United States, ''Toxicodendron'' ''dermatitis'' is the most common cause of ''contact dermatitis''.''Sensitivity to urushiol occurs when individuals come into contact with it. The first time a person is exposed, they may not develop a rash. However, with repeated exposure, sensitivity develops that ultimately leads to the development of the characteristic rash. Most people (about 85%) will develop sensitivity, while a small percentage of individuals (about 15%) never develop an ''allergic reaction'' to urushiol.' "
"What are risk factors for poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Any individual who comes into contact with these plants is at risk for developing the rash. However, people who spend more time outdoors in geographic areas where these plants are known to grow are at higher risk. This may include certain occupations associated with outdoor work in these areas, such as gardeners, groundskeepers, farmers, forestry workers, and construction workers. Hiking enthusiasts may also be at higher risk if they venture into areas where these plants are present.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Susceptible people will develop the characteristic rash after exposure to the urushiol from these plants, typically within 12-72 hours after the initial contact. The signs and symptoms can include the following:'""The rash may appear bumpy, streaky, linear, or patchy, and it will affect the areas that have come into contact with the oil resin. Areas that have been exposed to a larger amount of urushiol may develop the rash more quickly, and the rash may appear more severe. In some instances, new lesions may continue to appear for up to two to three weeks. One can spread the rash to other parts of the body if one's contaminated hands (with the oil resin) touch other areas. The fluid that sometimes oozes from the blisters does not contain urushiol and therefore does not spread the rash, and other individuals who touch this fluid will not develop the rash. In order to spread the rash to someone else, they must directly come into contact with the oil resin. Generally speaking, the rash slowly improves and disappears after one to three weeks in most individuals. Overall, the symptoms may range from mild to severe. Rarely, in extreme cases, an anaphylactic reaction can develop.""'If these plants are burned, the airborne particles of urushiol can be inhaled, causing respiratory difficulty from irritation of the lungs. Occasionally, this reaction can be severe.'

"What types of doctors treat poison ivy, oak, and sumac rash?","'The rash produced by exposure to ''poison ivy, oak, and sumac'' is generally treated by a primary-care physician, including family physicians, internists, and pediatricians. In cases where the diagnosis is not clear, a dermatologist may be consulted.' "
"How do physicians diagnose poison ivy, oak, and sumac rashes?","'The diagnosis of this rash is typically made by a health-care professional after obtaining a thorough history and performing a detailed exam of the skin. While some individuals will know and report exposure to poison ivy, oak, or sumac, others may not be aware of it and may not recall any exposure. The appearance of the characteristic rash is usually all that is needed to make the diagnosis. No blood tests or imaging studies are necessary.' "
"What is the treatment for a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'The initial treatment for someone who has recently been exposed to any of these plants includes rinsing the affected area with copious amounts of warm water within 20-30 minutes of exposure to remove the oily plant resin. The effectiveness of rinsing decreases with the passage of time, as the oily plant resin is quickly absorbed into the skin. Some authorities recommend rinsing with rubbing ''alcohol'', commercially available poisonous plant washes, or degreasing soaps and detergents. It is also important to scrub under the fingernails to remove any remnants of the plant resin. In addition, thoroughly clean clothing or any objects that may have come into contact with these plants.''If the characteristic rash develops, initial treatment consists of symptomatic care, as in most cases, the rash will improve on its own after one to three weeks. Self-care at home is usually all that is necessary. In the meantime, the following treatments may be useful to alleviate symptoms:' 

Read Doctor's View
   Apply cool compresses to the skin. Use topical treatments to relieve itching, including calamine lotion, oatmeal baths, Tecnu, Zanfel, or aluminum acetate (Domeboro solution). Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can also help relieve itching. For a more severe rash, a health-care professional may prescribe a high-potency steroid cream or an oral corticosteroid (such as prednisone). Over-the-counter pain medication may be necessary for pain control. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the rash becomes infected. Avoid scratching the rash to prevent the development of a bacterial infection. Go to the nearest emergency department or call an ambulance if experiencing an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) characterized by difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, facial swelling, or if one has had a previous severe reaction to these plants. Also seek medical care if the rash involves the genitals or the face or if the rash shows signs of infection."
"Are there any home remedies for a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'As above, in the majority of cases, the symptoms can be controlled at home with the aforementioned medications/formulations until the rash resolves. Though different herbal folk remedies have been used in the past, no definite effective therapy can be recommended at this time.'  "
"What is the prognosis of a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'In general, the prognosis is excellent. In the vast majority of cases, the rash will improve on its own within one to three weeks without any complications, and all that is necessary is self-care at home with treatment to relieve the itching.' "
"Is it possible to prevent a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'There are measures that can be taken to help prevent the rash caused by exposure to these plants, including the following:'   Learn to recognize these plants in order to avoid contact with them. Wear protective clothing that covers the skin, including gloves, long sleeves, long pants, and boots if in a high-risk area. If the possibility of contact with these plants exists, apply commercially available barrier creams to the skin, which may help prevent or lessen the exposure to the toxic plant oils. These products usually contain bentoquatam (IvyBlock) and should be applied before going outdoors. Do not burn these plants, as this can release urushiol into the air. Carefully remove these plants if they are growing near one's home. Be sure to wear protective clothing and gloves. Thoroughly wash clothing or any other objects that may have come into contact with these plants, as they can retain the plant oil and cause a rash if worn or touched. If a pet has been exposed to these plants, wear protective gloves and give them a bath."
"What does a poison ivy, oak, and sumac rash look like?","'The urushiol oil present in the leaves, stems, and roots of ''poison ivy, oak, and sumac'' is the one that is responsible for the rash. Most people who touch any of these plants will experience the following:' The rash appears wherever you itch. Most often, the rash is red and blistering. The rash itches so intensely that it can wake you while asleep. The blisters tend to burst and leak the fluid. The rash usually appears within a few hours after contact with the plant if you tend to develop allergic reactions. If you have not experienced the rash earlier, it may appear after two to three weeks."
"How do you treat poison ivy, oak, and sumac rash?","'Once you have come in contact with poison ivy, oak, or sumac plants, the first thing that you should do is rinse the affected skin thoroughly with lukewarm or soapy water. Here is what you can do to treat the rash at home:''If your rash does not show improvement in 7-10 days or becomes infected (filled with pus and painful on touch), you should consult a board-certified dermatologist who can prescribe medications for the same.' You can apply cool compresses to the skin. You can use topical treatments to relieve itching such as oatmeal or baking soda bath, calamine lotion, and hydrocortisone cream. Oral pills of antihistamines such as cetirizine, Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Zyrtec (cetirizine), or Allegra (fexofenadine) also help relieve itching. Take care to not scratch because scratching can cause an infection. Do not pick the blisters because it can make the blisters open and expose the underlying skin to the germs. Wash your skin gently because scrubbing the skin makes the oil irritate the skin further."
"How long does a poison ivy, oak, and sumac rash last?","'The rash from ''poison ivy, oak, and sumac'' can be extremely ''itchy'' until it clears completely. How long your rash will last depends on whether you’ve had a rash from one of these plants before. If you have' A history of rash from poison ivy, oak, or sumac, the rash lasts for 1-14 days before clearing up on its own. Never had a rash from poison ivy, oak, or sumac, you can have a rash for 21 days or longer before it disappears."
What is arsenic?,"'Arsenic is a grey-appearing chemical element (atomic number 33, symbol As in the periodic table) also termed a metalloid. Arsenic can exist in a metallic state in three forms (yellow, black, and gray; with gray predominating) and in ionic forms. Arsenic is considered to be a heavy metal, and arsenic toxicity shares some features with poisonings by other heavy metals. Historically, arsenic has been used as a medicinal agent, a pigment, a pesticide, and an agent with intent to harm (use with criminal intent). Up until 2003, arsenic (in the form of chromated copper arsenate) was used in the US as a treatment to prevent insect infestation of wood used in building. In 2003 the use of this compound was banned by the US Environmental Protection Agency. ''Arsenic is mixed with copper or lead to strengthen alloys containing these materials. Arsenic and some of its compounds react with proteins, mainly the thiol portions, and uncouples the process of oxidative phosphorylation, thus inactivating most cellular functions. Consequently, arsenic and some of the substances it combines with are deadly poisons to most biologic systems, except for a few bacterial species. Arsenic is used in making insecticides and weed killers. Arsenic is also thought to be carcinogenic, meaning that it has the potential to cause ''cancer''. ''Arsenic can be found as a contaminant in food and water sources. Shellfish and other seafood, as well as fruits, vegetables, and rice; are the foods most commonly contaminated. Arsenic poisoning typically occurs as a result of industrial exposure, from contaminated wine or illegally distilled spirits, or in cases of malicious intent. ' "
What is inorganic arsenic?,"'Inorganic arsenic is metallic or a metalloid element that forms a number of poisonous compounds. In industry, it can be found in a gaseous form termed arsine ''gas'' that is very toxic when inhaled. Inorganic arsenic is found in nature at low levels mostly compounded with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. These are called inorganic arsenic compounds. Inorganic arsenic compounds are much more poisonous to most biologic systems (animals, plants, humans) than organic arsenic (see below). Inorganic arsenic occurs in nature in the soil, copper and lead ore deposits, and water, but usually in low concentrations. However, it can become more concentrated when industrial processes use it to make wood preservatives, metal compounds, or organic arsenic-containing compounds such as insecticides, weed killers, and other compounds. If such compounds are burned, inorganic arsenic can be released into the air and later settle on the ground or in water and either remain in the inorganic form or combine with organic material.' "
What is organic arsenic?,"'Organic arsenic is any compound that is made from a chemical combination of the element arsenic with any organic compound (compounds containing a large amount of carbon). These are often termed arsenical organic compounds. Most frequently organic arsenic is a component used in making insecticides and weed killers and other compounds. Organic arsenic usually is not poisonous to humans but may be poisonous to humans in high concentrations. In general, organic arsenic is usually far less poisonous than inorganic arsenic. ' "
What are the symptoms of arsenic poisoning?,"'People can be exposed to arsenic by inhaling it, by consuming contaminated foods, water, or ''beverages'', or by skin contact. We are normally exposed to trace amounts of arsenic in the air and water, and in foods. People may be exposed to higher levels if they live near industrial areas that currently or formerly contained arsenic compounds. Areas with known high concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water are also associated with greater exposure. ''Acute or immediate symptoms of a toxic level of exposure to arsenic may include the following: ''Long-term exposures to arsenic lower than toxic levels can lead to skin changes (darkening or discoloration, redness, swelling and hyperkeratosis (skin ''bumps'' that resemble ''corns'' or ''warts'""). Whitish lines (Mees' lines) may appear in the fingernails. Both sensory and motor nerve defects can develop. Additionally,  ""'liver'' and kidney function may be affected. ''Arsenic exposure over the long-term has also been associated with the development of certain ''cancers'', and arsenic has been classified as a carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Studies of people in parts of Southeast Asia and South America where there has been a high level of arsenic in the drinking water have reported an increased risk of developing cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung, and skin. Organic arsenic compounds are not as toxic as inorganic compounds and are not believed to be linked to ''cancer''. '   Vomiting  Abdominal pain  Diarrhea  Dark urine (termed black water urine)  Dehydration  Cardiac problems  Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)  Vertigo  Delirium  Shock  Death "
How is arsenic poisoning diagnosed?,"'The history of the patient is very important as exposures are most often from industrial accidents so other people (coworkers, rescue personnel) may be exposed and not realize they may have some risk also. People exposed to toxic levels of arsenic may have breath and urine that smells like ''garlic'' as a clue to their diagnosis. Most doctors that suspect arsenic (or other metal or metalloid poisonings) will request lab studies such as blood cell counts andserum ''electrolytes'' such as calcium and magnesium; if there is evidence of hemolysis (blood cell destruction), a type and screening for a potential ''blood transfusion'' is done.''\xa0There are rapid urine ""spot"" tests available to diagnose elevated levels of arsenic, but they usually don\'t distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic. The patient\'s blood and urine will be sent for analysis for arsenic; a result of > 50 micrograms/L is considered elevated, but acute toxic exposures may result in levels 5 to 100 times or more than those which are considered ""elevated."" A speciation test (determines levels of inorganic versus organic arsenic) is required in all cases in which total urine arsenic is elevated since inorganic arsenic is so toxic. Electrocardiograms (''ECG'', ''EKG'') and nerve conduction tests are often done in any type of suspected arsenic exposure. Tests for other toxins or toxic overdoses (for example, ''Tylenol'' ingestion) may also be done. '  "
How is arsenic poisoning treated?,"'Acute toxic inorganic arsenic exposure and arsine ''gas'"" exposure can rapidly result in death, and there are only a few ways to possibly save the patient's life. ""'Hemodialysis'' can remove arsenic from the bloodstream, but only before it binds to the tissues so there is only a short time window for this treatment to work. Similarly, arsine binds to and causes rapid destruction of red blood cells, so blood transfusions and exchange transfusions may help the patient. In addition, if the arsenic was ingested, stomach or bowel irrigation may be attempted, but there is no good data to indicate these will be successful. Consultation with a nephrologist and a toxicologist as soon as possible is recommended; other consultants may need to be called (hematologist, psychiatrist, or others).''Chelation therapy (the use of ''drugs'' that selectively bind and effectively inactivate substances) is usually begun quickly through an intravenous line. The drug and the bound arsenic is then excreted through the urine. The chelation drug of choice is Dimercaprol (also termed BAL in oil); ''Succimer'' (DMSA) has also been used successfully, and Dimerval (DMPS) may also work as a chelator, but it is not readily available in the US.'  "
What is the prognosis (outcome) of arsenic poisoning?,"'If the patient survives an acute toxic exposure, most will develop some degree of nerve damage to the peripheral nerves (sensory and motor disturbances); many survivors may have cardiac, ''liver'', renal, and skin problems; the prognosis is fair to poor. Chronic poisoning and organic arsenic exposure have better outcomes with fewer and less severe problems. ' "
"In what foods (rice), products (apple juice), or liquids (water) is arsenic found, where it is used, and what are safe limits?","'People may be exposed through work in a metal foundry, mining, glass production, the semiconductor industry, in criminal attempts at murder by poisoning, ''suicide'' attempts, and as a biological warfare agent.''Recent examples of concerns about arsenic have surfaced because of its presence in apple juice. In most studies, various sources of apple juice tested by government and consumer labs have found that most (over 95% tested) contain a very small amount of arsenic (less than 10 parts per billion) and are safe to drink (in contrast to a TV show that raised alarms about consuming apple juice). However, the FDA qualified their findings by indicating in July 2013, new standards would apply and any juice that contained 10 or more parts per billion (the same level set for safe groundwater) would not be permitted to be sold in the US. This is lower than the previous approved level of less than 23 parts per billion approved in 2008. Nonetheless, other groups suggest that only juice containing less than 3 parts per billion be FDA approved.''Two other sources of arsenic, especially of some concern for children, is arsenic in groundwater and subsequently, in rice that is grown in such groundwater. Rice is a common food for children but to date, there are no regulations about the levels of arsenic that are considered safe for consumption. The FDA and the EPA are currently collecting data to make a recommendation about safe levels but many groups are pushing the FDA to act soon. The groups claim some private laboratories have detected that a single adult serving of some commercially available rice can give about 1.5 times the amount of permissible arsenic in one liter of water (under 10 parts per billion), so action on permissible arsenic levels should be done quickly. In 2013, the CDC recommends only about 2 cups of cooked rice per individual (adult) per week.'   Arsenic has been found to contaminate such common items as wine, glues, and pigments. Arsenic is commonly found in many foods both in its relatively nontoxic organic form, and also in the more toxic inorganic form. Consequently, such foods need to be tested for both inorganic and organic arsenic levels. Arsenic has been reported in milk and dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, and cereal. Arsenic is also often found in rice, representing a potentially serious source of exposure in certain at-risk populations (especially children). Many water sources in the world have high levels of arsenic in them, both due to normal arsenic leaching out of the ground and from mining and industrial waste."
What is ciguatera poisoning?,"'Ciguatera is a type of ''food poisoning''. The ciguatera toxin may be found in large reef fish, most commonly barracuda, grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and Spanish mackerel. These fish live in coral reef waters between latitudes of 35 degrees south to 35 degrees north, corresponding to the area located between the Tropic of ''Cancer'' and the Tropic of Capricorn. These geographic lines ring the earth north and south of the equator and make up the tropics. These areas include the Caribbean Sea, Hawaii, and coastal Central America.''Ciguatera toxin tends to accumulate in predator fish, such as the Barracuda and other carnivorous reef fish because they eat other fish that consume toxin-producing algae (dinoflagellates) that live in coral reef waters.''Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish but poisonous to humans. The toxin is odorless and tasteless, and it is heat-resistant, so cooking does not destroy the toxin. Eating ciguatera-contaminated tropical or subtropical fish poisons the person who eats it.'  "
What are the symptoms of ciguatera poisoning?,"'Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning generally begin six to eight hours after eating the contaminated fish.''Symptoms include:''Hot and ''cold'' sensation may be reversed.''Severe cases of ciguatera poisoning may result in tearing of the eyes, ''chills'', skin ''rash'', ''itching'', ''shortness of breath'', ''drooling'', and ''paralysis''. Death due to heart or respiratory failure occurs in rare cases.'   nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vertigo."
What is the treatment for ciguatera poisoning?,"'If you or someone you know has ingested a fish that you suspect might be contaminated with ciguatera toxin, and you or they have signs or symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, pain, trouble breathing, seizure,  confusion, or abnormal skin color, call either an ambulance or the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for guidance.

Lead Poisoning Tips,"'Lead poisoning'' is entirely preventable. The key is stopping children from coming into contact with lead and treating children who have been poisoned by lead.'""The goal is to prevent lead exposure to children before they are harmed. There are many ways parents can reduce a child's exposure to lead. The key is stopping children from coming into contact with lead. Lead hazards in a child's environment must be identified and controlled or removed safely."" "
How Are Children Exposed to Lead?,"'Lead-based paint and lead contaminated dust are the main sources of exposure for lead in U.S. children. Lead-based paints were banned for use in housing in 1978. All houses built before 1978 are likely to contain some lead-based paint. However, it is the deterioration of this paint that causes a problem. Approximately 24 million housing units have deteriorated leaded paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust. More than 4 million of these dwellings are homes to one or more young children.' "
Who Is At Risk For Lead Poisoning?,"'All children under the age of 6 years old are at risk because they are growing so rapidly and because they tend to put their hands or other objects, which may be contaminated with lead dust, into their mouths.''However, children living at or below the poverty line who live in older housing are at greatest risk. Additionally, children of some racial and ethnic groups and those living in older housing are disproportionately affected by lead.' "
Can Lead Poisoning Be Prevented?,"'It is important to determine the construction year of the house or the dwelling where your child may spend a large amount of time (e.g., grandparents or daycare). In housing built before 1978, assume that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise.''Talk to your state or local health department about testing paint and dust from your home for lead.''Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint.''Pregnant'' women and children should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed.'""Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, parents should clean and isolate all sources of lead. They should close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children's access to other sources of lead.""""Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or exterior soil. Both are known lead sources.""'Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, parents should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, windows should be shut to prevent ''abrasion'' of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash.''Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Parents should plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. Until the bare soil is covered, parents should move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the house. If using a sandbox, parents should also cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste.'""To further reduce a child's exposure from non-residential paint sources:""  avoid using traditional home remedies and cosmetics that may contain lead; avoid eating candies imported from Mexico; avoid using containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to be lead free; remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. Check Lead Recalls lists. use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and for making baby formula (Hot water is more likely to contain higher levels of lead. Most of the lead in household water usually comes from the plumbing in your house, not from the local water supply.); shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based products such as stain glass work, bullet making, or using a firing range."

They each have specific effects on human health. ''Sources of mercury.'"" Mercury is an element in the earth's crust. Humans cannot create or destroy mercury. Pure mercury is a liquid metal, sometimes referred to as quicksilver that volatizes readily. It has traditionally been used to make products like thermometers, switches, and some light bulbs. ""'Mercury is found in many rocks including coal.'' When coal is burned, mercury is released into the environment. Coal-burning power plants are the largest human-caused source of mercury emissions to the air in the United States, accounting for over 40 percent of all domestic human-caused mercury emissions. EPA has estimated that about one quarter of U.S. emissions from coal-burning power plants are deposited within the contiguous U.S. and the remainder enters the global cycle. Burning hazardous wastes, producing chlorine, breaking mercury products, and spilling mercury, as well as the improper treatment and disposal of products or wastes containing mercury, can also release it into the environment. Current estimates are that less than half of all mercury deposition within the U.S. comes from U.S. sources. ''Exposure to mercury.'' Mercury in the air eventually settles into water or onto land where it can be washed into water. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. Fish and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury exposure to humans. Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than others. ''Fish that typically have higher levels of mercury include ''Many of these types of fish are used in sushi. White albacore canned tuna typically has three times as much mercury as chunk light canned tuna. The levels of methylmercury in fish and shellfish depend on what they eat, how long they live and how high they are in the food chain. ''EPA works with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with states and tribes to issue advice to women who may become ''pregnant'', pregnant women, ''nursing'' mothers, and parents of young children about how often they should eat certain types of commercially-caught fish and shellfish. Fish advisories are also issued for men, women, and children of all ages when appropriate. In addition, EPA releases an annual summary of information on locally-issued fish advisories and safe-eating guidelines to the public. Fish is a beneficial part of the ''diet'', so EPA & FDA encourage people to continue to eat fish that are low in methylmercury. ''Another less common exposure to mercury that can be a concern is ''breathing'' mercury vapor. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury or products that contain elemental mercury break and release mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly-ventilated indoor spaces. ''Health effects of mercury. '""Mercury exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages. Research shows that most people's fish consumption does not cause a health concern. However, it has been demonstrated that high levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the developing nervous system, making the child less able to think and learn. ""'Ecological effects of mercury.'"" Birds and mammals that eat fish are more exposed to mercury than other animals in water ecosystems. Similarly, predators that eat fish-eating animals may be highly exposed. At high levels of exposure, methylmercury's harmful effects on these animals include death, reduced reproduction, slower growth and development, and abnormal behavior. ""'Reducing mercury releases.'' EPA issues regulations that require industry to reduce mercury releases to air and water and to properly treat and dispose of mercury wastes. EPA also works with industry to promote voluntary reductions in mercury use and releases, and with partners in state, local and tribal governments to improve their mercury reduction programs. EPA works with international organizations to prevent the release of mercury in other countries. The public can contribute to mercury reduction efforts by purchasing mercury-free products and correctly disposing of products that contain mercury by reducing demand for products whose production leads to the release of mercury into the environment.'

What factors determine the severity of health effects from mercury exposure?,"""People in the U.S. are mainly exposed to methylmercury, an organic compound, when they eat fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury. Whether an exposure to the various forms of mercury will harm a person's health depends on a number of factors. Almost all people have at least trace amounts of methylmercury in their tissues, reflecting methylmercury's widespread presence in the environment and people's exposure through the consumption of fish and shellfish. People may be exposed to mercury in any of its forms under different circumstances. The factors that determine how severe the health effects are from mercury exposure include these""   the chemical form of mercury;  the dose;  the age of the person exposed (the fetus is the most susceptible);  the duration of exposure;  the route of exposure -- inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact, etc.; and  the health of the person exposed. "
"What are the side effects, signs, and symptoms of mercury poisoning?","""For fetuses, infants, and children, the primary health effect of methylmercury is impaired neurological development. Methylmercury exposure in the womb, which can result from a mother's consumption of fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury, can adversely affect a baby's growing brain and nervous system. Impacts on cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills have been seen in children exposed to methylmercury in the womb. Recent human biological monitoring by the Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention'' in 1999 and 2000 (PDF) shows that most people have blood mercury levels below a level associated with possible health effects. ''More recent data from the CDC'' support this general finding. ''Outbreaks of methylmercury poisonings have made it clear that adults, children, and developing fetuses are at risk from ingestion exposure to methylmercury. During these poisoning outbreaks some mothers with no symptoms of nervous system damage gave birth to infants with severe disabilities, it became clear that the developing nervous system of the fetus may be more vulnerable to methylmercury than is the adult nervous system. ''For more information on fish consumption advisories across the country, visit '""EPA's fish consumption web pages""'. ''In addition to the subtle impairments noted above, symptoms of methylmercury poisoning may include;''People concerned about their exposure to methylmercury should consult their physician. ''Elemental (metallic) mercury primarily causes health effects when it is breathed as a vapor where it can be absorbed through the lungs. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury is spilled or products that contain elemental mercury break and expose mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly-ventilated indoor spaces. ''Symptoms include these: ''At higher exposures there may be kidney effects, respiratory failure and death. People concerned about their exposure to elemental mercury should consult their physician. ''High exposures to inorganic mercury may result in damage to the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, and the kidneys. Both inorganic and organic mercury compounds are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and affect other systems via this route. However, organic mercury compounds are more readily absorbed via ingestion than inorganic mercury compounds. ''Symptoms of high exposures to inorganic mercury include: ''People concerned about their exposure to inorganic mercury should consult their physician. '   impairment of the peripheral vision;  disturbances in sensations (""pins and needles"" feelings, usually in the hands, feet, and around the mouth); lack of coordination of movements;  impairment of speech, hearing, walking; and  muscle weakness.  tremors;  emotional changes (for example, mood swings, irritability, nervousness, excessive shyness);  insomnia;  neuromuscular changes (such as weakness, muscle atrophy, twitching);  headaches;  disturbances in sensations;  changes in nerve responses;  performance deficits on tests of cognitive function.  skin rashes and dermatitis;  mood swings;  memory loss;  mental disturbances; and  muscle weakness.

What about mercury in batteries?,"'Most batteries made in the U.S. do not contain added mercury. The two exceptions are ''mercuric oxide batteries'' and ''button cell batteries''. Mercuric oxide batteries are produced for specialized use in military and medical equipment where a stable current and long service life is essential. Button cell batteries are miniature batteries in the shape of a coin or button that are used to provide power for a large variety of small portable electronic devices. ''The use and disposal of mercury-added button cells are unregulated at the federal level. ''Some states are now considering whether the disposal of button cell batteries should be regulated or whether recycling should be encouraged. Because button batteries currently are not widely targeted for recycling, almost all of this mercury presumably ends up in the municipal solid waste stream where it is either incinerated or landfilled. '""For a more information on batteries, see EPA's Web page on ""'Consumer and Commercial Products''. ' They do not have to be labeled;  it is legal to dispose of them in the household trash; and  they rarely are collected for recycling in most U.S. jurisdictions. "
What about mercury in dental amalgam?,"'The silver fillings used by dentists to restore ''teeth'' are composed of a metal ""amalgam"" containing roughly 50% elemental mercury and 50% other metals (mostly silver with some tin and copper). Amalgam is one of the most commonly used tooth fillings, and is considered to be a safe, sound, and effective treatment for ''tooth decay''. Amalgam has been the most widely used tooth filling material for decades. It remains popular because it is strong, lasting and low-cost. Dental amalgams are considered medical devices and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ''The mercury found in amalgam fillings has raised some safety concerns over the years. Amalgam can release small amounts of mercury vapor over time, and patients can absorb these vapors by inhaling or ingesting them. ''According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is little scientific evidence that the health of the vast majority of people with dental amalgam is compromised, nor that removing amalgam fillings has a beneficial effect on health. A 2004 review of the scientific literature conducted for the U.S. Public Health Service found ""insufficient evidence of a link between dental mercury and health problems, except in rare instances of ''allergic reaction''."" ''The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consumer update on dental amalgam advises, as a precaution, that pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure should discuss dental treatment options with their health care practitioner. FDA, which regulates the use of dental amalgam, is reviewing the scientific evidence on the safe use of amalgam.''Amalgam use is declining because the incidence of dental decay is decreasing and because improved substitute materials are now available for certain applications. If dental patients do not want to use mercury amalgam, there are several non-mercury restorative materials available. Presently, there are six types of restorative materials: ''Each type of restorative material has advantages and disadvantages. Some factors that influence the choice of restorative material used include: cost, strength, durability, location of ''cavity'', and aesthetics. ''The choice of dental treatment rests with dental professionals and their patients, so you should talk with your dentist about dental treatment options that are available. The American Dental Association provides a brochure for dental patients on the advantages and disadvantages of various types of dental fillings. ''Mercury from dental amalgam is a major source of controllable mercury released to the environment and likely will remain a significant concern into the future.''Mercury from dental amalgam is released to the environment through three primary pathways: '""The majority of dental mercury amalgam is discharged from dental offices to wastewater treatment systems.

What about mercury in fish?,"'Fish and shellfish are an important part of a healthy ''diet''. Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain ''omega-3 fatty acids'"". A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development. """"However, nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of methylmercury. For most people, the risk from exposure to methylmercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern. Yet some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The risks from methlymercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of methylmercury in the fish. Federal, state and local governments issue fish advisories when the fish are unsafe to eat.

What about mercury in fluorescent light bulbs?,"'A fluorescent light bulb (also referred to as a ""lamp"") is a ''gas''-discharge bulb that uses electricity to excite mercury vapor. The excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet light that causes a phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light. Mercury is an essential component of all fluorescent light bulbs, and allows these bulbs to be energy-efficient light sources. ''Tube: ''The standard straight ""linear"" tube comes in a variety of diameters and lengths. For example:''Compact fluorescent light (CFL):'' This is a short bulb made of a tube about the diameter of a pencil that has been either folded or twisted, resulting in an overall size that rivals a standard incandescent light bulb. Since the CFL fits into a standard light socket, the bulb and fixture design possibilities are vastly increased over that of a fluorescent tube. CFLs are now available in a variety of shapes, including spiral (twisted), short tube (folded over) and globe. A globe CFL is either round or A-shaped glass that contains within it a spiral or folded tube. ''EPA encourages Americans to use compact fluorescent lights in order to save energy. Switching from traditional incandescent bulbs to CFLs is an effective, simple change everyone can make right now to help use less electricity at home and prevent greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global climate change. ''Learn about CFLs'' – General information on Energy Star-qualified compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), where to use CFLs in a home, and how to choose the right type of CFL bulb. ''CFLs contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing. No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact (not broken) or in use, but CFLs can break and release mercury vapor if dropped or roughly handled. EPA encourages consumers to handle and use CFLs safely. Be careful when removing the bulb from its packaging, installing it, or replacing it. More information is provided in the ''Energy Star fact sheet: CFLs and Mercury'' (PDF). '""If a CFL breaks in your home, please follow EPA's recommended steps to carefully""' clean up and dispose of broken bulbs''. These recommendations will help to minimize any exposure to released mercury vapor. ''EPA encourages the ''recycling of burned out fluorescent bulbs'' rather than disposing of them in regular household trash. Recycling of burned out CFLs is one of the best ways to help prevent the release of mercury to the environment by keeping mercury out of landfills and incinerators. Recycling of these bulbs also allows the reuse of the glass, metals and other materials that make up fluorescent lights. ' The T-4 is ½ inch in diameter and often used under kitchen cabinets.  The T-8 is 1 inch in diameter and the T-12 is 1½ inches in diameter.  Variations include the ""U-tube"" bent in half to form a U-shape, and the ""circline"" tube bent into a circle.

Thermometers (Fever),"'Mercury ''fever'' thermometers are made of glass the size of a straw, with a silvery-white liquid inside, and used to be a common item in many households, schools and medical facilities. Now it is nearly impossible to buy one as digital thermometers have become the norm. There are two general types of mercury thermometers that measure body temperature: (1) oral/rectal/baby thermometers, containing about 0.61 grams of mercury; and (2) ''basal temperature'' thermometers, containing about 2.25 grams of mercury. ''The presence of a mercury thermometer itself is not a problem. However glass thermometers may break while in use, releasing harmful mercury vapor and exposing people in the immediate indoor area. Mercury thermometers are also likely to break after being discarded in regular trash, resulting in mercury releases in the landfill or trash incinerator, or during transportation to either location. It is for this reason The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) encourages parents to remove mercury thermometers from their homes to prevent accidental exposure and poisoning.''In order to help remove the threat of mercury fever thermometer breakage and subsequent release of mercury vapor indoors, some states and municipalities have passed laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of these thermometers. ''As of October 2, 2008, thirteen states have laws that limit the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of mercury fever thermometers:'' ''The ''Health Care Without Harm Web site'' presents information on specific state laws and municipal ordinances. ''A variety of accurate and reliable mercury-free fever thermometers are available at your local pharmacy. Alternatives most comparable in cost and use to the mercury fever thermometer include battery and solar powered digital thermometers. These can all be used orally, rectally, or in the armpit. You should choose a thermometer that is easy to use and read. ''If choosing a battery powered digital thermometer, choose one that contains a replaceable battery; some are not replaceable. The battery is a button cell battery and may contain a small amount of mercury, so it should be recycled through a local battery collection program or ''household hazardous waste collection center''. Consult your local or state collection program regarding where batteries should be taken. ''A broken mercury thermometer is a serious health threat. If mercury spills out of a broken thermometer and is not cleaned up, it will evaporate into invisible vapor, potentially reaching dangerous levels in indoor air. If a thermometer breaks in your home, please follow '""EPA's recommended cleanup steps""' to carefully clean up and dispose of the broken glass and silver mercury beads.

"What is ricin, and where does it come from?","  Castor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste ""mash"" produced when castor oil is made. Ricin is a poison protein found naturally in castor beans from the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis). If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. It can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 degrees centigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit)."
"How soon do poisoning symptoms start, and how long does death take?"," 

Read Doctor's View
   The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of poisoning by inhalation may occur as early as 4- 8 hours and as late as 24 hours after exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 10 hours. Inhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to it, people having respiratory symptoms should seek medical care. Ingestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would likely develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. Skin and eye exposure: It is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. However, if you touch ricin that is on your skin and then eat food with your hands or put your hands in your mouth, you may ingest some. Ricin poisoning could kill a person within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received."
How much ricin is lethal?,"""Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur."" Effects of this type of poisoning depend on whether it was inhaled, ingested, or injected. It is difficult to say exactly how much ricin could kill a person as it depends on the castor beans: their size, weight, moisture content, time of harvest, and other factors. The minimum number of castor beans associated with death was 2, but it symptoms of castor bean poisoning have been documented with as few as one half a bean, to up to 30 beans."
"How you could be exposed to ricin, and how deadly is it?"," It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Unintentional exposure to ricin is highly unlikely, except through the ingestion of castor beans. If made into a partially purified material or refined into a terrorist or warfare agent, ricin could be used to expose people through the air, food, or water. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. In the 1940s the U.S. military experimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent. In some reports ricin has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations. Ricin poisoning is not contagious. Ricin-associated illness cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or clothes, you could become exposed to it."
What is ricin used for?,"'Ricin is found in the byproducts of castor oil production. It is a protein. Unfortunately, it is used as a biological weapon and by assassins.'

In some reports it has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. It has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells. Protein toxins such as ricin kill cells and if it can be properly targeted, the goal would be to use it to selectively kill cancer cells while normal cells are spared."
"Is there a treatment, antidote, or cure for ricin poisoning?"," Because there is no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding exposure to it in the first place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Symptomatic poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizure and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated."
What should I do if I've been exposed to ricin?,"   Exposure to this type of poisoning is not always fatal, and it's possible to survive. Get fresh air right away by leaving the area where the ricin was released.If it release was outside, move away from the area where it was released.If it release was indoors, get out of the building. If it release was outside, move away from the area where it was released. If it release was indoors, get out of the building. If you are near a release of ricin, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to ""shelter in place"" inside a building to avoid being exposed to the chemical. If you think you may have been exposed to this type of poisoning, you should remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Removing your clothing:Quickly take off clothing that may have ricin on it.

How do authorities confirm cases of suspected ricin poisoning?," If authorities suspect that people have inhaled ricin, a potential clue would be that a large number of people who had been close to each other rapidly developed fever, cough, and excess fluid in their lungs. These symptoms would likely be followed by severe breathing problems and possibly death. If in suspected situations where the poison may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities detects ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of poisoning. CDC can assess selected specimens on a provisional basis for urinary ricinine, an alkaloid in the castor bean plant. Only urinary ricinine testing is available at CDC or the LRN."

What happens to thallium when it enters the environment?,"""Thallium enters the environment primarily from coal-burning and smelting, in which it is a trace contaminant of the raw materials. It stays in the air, water, and soil for a long time and is not broken down. Some thallium compounds are removed from the atmosphere in rain and snow. It's absorbed by plants and enters the food chain. It builds up in fish and shellfish. "" "
How might I be exposed to thallium?,"   Eating food contaminated with thallium may be a major source of exposure for most people. Breathing workplace air in industries that use thallium. Smoking cigarettes. Living near hazardous waste sites containing thallium (may result in higher than normal exposures). Touching or, for children, eating soil contaminated with thallium. Breathing low levels in air and water."
How can thallium affect my health?,"'Exposure to high levels of thallium can result in harmful health effects. A study on workers exposed on the job over several years reported nervous system effects, such as numbness of fingers and toes, from breathing thallium. ''Studies in people who ingested large amounts of thallium over a short time have reported ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', temporary ''hair loss'', and effects on the nervous system, ''lungs'', ''heart'', ''liver'', and kidneys. It has caused death. It is not known what the effects are from ingesting low levels of thallium over a long time. ''Birth defects'' were not reported in the children of mothers exposed to low levels from eating vegetables and fruits contaminated with thallium. Studies in rats, however, exposed to high levels of thallium, showed adverse developmental effects. ''It is not known if breathing or ingesting thallium affects human reproduction. Studies showed that rats that ingested thallium for several weeks had some adverse reproductive effects. Animal data suggest that the male reproductive system may be susceptible to damage by low levels of thallium. ''There is no information available on the health effects of skin contact with thallium in people or animals. ' "
How likely is thallium to cause cancer?,"'The Department of Health and Human Services, the International Agency for Research on ''Cancer'', and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not classified thallium as to its human carcinogenicity. ''No studies are available in people or animals on the carcinogenic effects of breathing, ingesting, or touching thallium. ' "
Is there a medical test to show whether I've been exposed to thallium?,"'There are medical tests available to measure levels of thallium in urine and hair. In addition, thallium can also be measured in blood; however, this is not a good indicator of exposure since thallium only stays in blood a very short time. '""These tests require special equipment that is not usually available in most doctor's offices. In addition, these tests cannot determine if adverse health effects will occur from the exposure to thallium. ""  "
Has the federal government made recommendations to protect human health?,"'The EPA requires that discharges or accidental spills into the environment of 1,000 pounds or more of thallium be reported. ''The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.1 milligrams per cubic meter (0.1 mg/m³) for thallium in workplace air. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established the same guidelines as OSHA for the workplace. ''The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 15 mg/m³ of thallium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death. ''Carcinogenicity: Ability to cause ''cancer''. ''Ingesting: Taking food or drink into your body.

What is Poland syndrome?,"'First described by the 19th-century British anatomist Sir Alfred Poland, Poland syndrome is a unique pattern of one-sided malformations that are present at birth (''congenital malformations''). Poland syndrome is noted for the underdevelopment or absence of the chest (pectoralis) muscles on one side of the body as well as webbing of the fingers (cutaneous syndactyly) on the hand of the same side (ipsilateral side) of the body.'  "
Can Poland syndrome affect either side of the body?,"'Yes. For reasons not understood, Poland syndrome is twice as likely to involve the right side of the body.' "
How frequent is Poland syndrome?,"'The severity of Poland syndrome is variable, and it is possible for mild cases not to be evident until ''puberty'' when breast tissue and chest muscle mass development become more obvious. It is felt, therefore, that cases may be misdiagnosed and underreported. Experts currently are reporting an incidence of one in 10,000 to one in 100,000 live births. For reasons unknown, boys are more likely than girls to have Poland syndrome.' "
What causes Poland syndrome?,"'The cause of Poland syndrome is not known. The disorder is currently considered ""a nonspecific developmental field defect"" occurring at about the sixth week of ''fetal development''. Diminished blood flow through the subclavian artery that supplies blood to the arm has been blamed, but final proof for this idea is lacking. Speculation has involved two hypotheses. One proposes that the underlying ribs on the affected side grow too quickly in a forward growth plane and thus reduce the flow of blood in the arteries leading to the overlying pectoralis muscle and arm on the affected side. Another proposal is that a malformation of the embryonic blood vessel serving the pectoralis muscle and arm/hand on that side of the body limits blood flow to these structures. To date no animal research has provided conclusive support for these proposals.' "
What are the features of Poland syndrome?,"'While the complete expression of the physical changes associated with Poland syndrome vary among patients, common themes include: '   underdevelopment or absence of the main chest muscle (pectoralis) as well as secondary muscles of the chest and armpit region; the end of the pectoralis muscle attachment to the breastbone (sternum) is absent; the nipple, areola, and (in females) underlying breast tissues are underdeveloped or absent; short and webbed fingers (cutaneous syndactyly) on the affected side; and armpit hair on the affected side is missing."
What other defects are associated with Poland syndrome?,"'The child with Poland syndrome usually is entirely normal except for the problems already noted. The skin in the involved area may be abnormally thinned or missing underlying fat normally present beneath the skin. Very rarely, the rib cage on the involved side may be underdeveloped or missing. Equally rare may be the abnormal development of the shoulder blade (scapula) or bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) on the affected side of the body. Spine and kidney malformations are also occasionally reported in patients with Poland syndrome. Intelligence is not impaired in Poland syndrome.'  "
Does Poland syndrome run in families?,"'Geneticists currently hold that Poland syndrome is rarely ''inherited'' and generally is a sporadic event. There are rare instances where more than one individual has been identified with Poland syndrome either in the immediate or extended family. Experience with an affected parent passing the syndrome to offspring has been described. Similarly, there are reports in the literature of affected siblings born to unaffected parents. The exact mode of genetic transmission has not been determined. Research is centering on inherited mechanisms dealing with intrauterine reduction of blood flow to the affected areas.' "
How is Poland syndrome diagnosed?,"'When the changes of Poland Syndrome are noted, the diagnosis can be suspected in the ''newborn'' period.  Specialized studies (''x-rays'', ''computerized tomography'' [''CT scans'']) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') studies may be utilized to delineate the anatomy of the involved area(s).  Such an understanding is necessary for reconstructive surgery (see below).  Mild cases of Poland syndrome may not be apparent until the child has matured or even until puberty.  During this time, differences in body development may be more pronounced—especially in female breast development.'  "
How is Poland syndrome treated?,"'Reconstructive surgery is the main treatment for those with Poland syndrome. Either existing chest muscle or transplanting muscle from another body area may be used to develop symmetry between the affected and unaffected side. If chest-wall ribs are underdeveloped or missing, bioengineered cartilage can be implanted to help give the chest a more normal appearance. Reconstructive surgery may be considered in males as young as 13 years of age. In females, in order to ensure breast similarity in size and character, reconstructive surgery is often postponed until breast development on the uninvolved side has been completed. Therapeutic tattooing can be uses to create the appearance of an areola and nipple.'  "
What are the related (alternative) terms?,"'Other names for Poland syndrome include Poland sequence, Poland anomaly, Poland syndactyly, and absence of the pectoralis muscle with syndactyly.' "

What is polio?,'Polio is in infectious disease that is caused by viruses that may result in a wide range of symptoms in patients. Other terms for polio include poliomyelitis and infantile paralysis. Symptoms can range from a non-paralytic ''flu-like'' infection to total paralysis that can occur within a few hours.' 
What is the history of polio?,"""The history of polio dates back about 6,000 years. Egyptian mummies have been found with withered and malformed limbs that likely occurred because of polio infection. In 1789, the first description of polio was recorded, and in 1834, the first documented epidemic occurred on the island of St. Helena. In 1855, Dr. Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne showed polio involved the anterior horn cells (nerve cells) of the spinal cord. Landsteiner and Popper discovered the virus in 1908. The Iron lung was developed in the late 1920s to help some polio survivors with polio breathe. One of the most famous people who had polio was U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945). The polio virus was first cultivated in tissue culture (1949), and in 1951, the three types of poliovirus were isolated and identified. During the mid-1950's (1954), the first large-scale trial of the vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk (dead virus vaccine) was administered by injection, and in 1958, Dr. Albert Sabin's vaccine (live attenuated virus) was administered as an oral vaccine. In 2000, the U.S. switched to using inactivated polio vaccine by injection. Other countries still may use the oral ""'poliovirus vaccine''. Because polio viruses survive only in humans and are transmitted only by human contact, the World Health Organization (WHO) is trying to eradicate polio worldwide. This attempt has been relatively successful with a 99% decrease in polio infections worldwide. In 2014, WHO announced that Southeast Asia was polio-free. However, some countries in Africa and the Middle East still have new infections caused by polio because of areas that cannot be reached by vaccine workers. Unfortunately, when there is war in these regions, polio makes a comeback because vaccine efforts are interrupted. The WHO still believes that polio eradication, like ''smallpox'', may happen in the near future.' "
What are polio symptoms and signs?,"""Fortunately, the vast majority of patients who are infected with polioviruses showed little or no symptoms and, in fact, don't know that they actually had an infection with polioviruses. Those patients who do show symptoms can be placed in one of two groups; non-paralytic polio (minor) and paralytic polio (major).""'Non-paralytic polio symptoms:''Paralytic polio symptoms:''Post-polio syndrome'' describes symptoms that develop in patients about 30 to 40 years after an acute polio illness. The cause is unknown. The ''post-polio syndrome'' symptoms include''Slowly progressive muscle ''weakness'' (any muscles, including the eye muscles and sometimes termed bulbar polio), generalized ''fatigue'', and ''cold'' intolerance may also occur.' Non-paralytic polio infections develop flu-like symptoms that consist of fever, sore throat, headache, malaise, and muscle stiffness (neck, back). Some people may get a skin rash that resemble a measles rash type. These symptoms last about 10-20 days and they completely resolve thus termed nonparalytic polio. Although paralytic polio symptoms mimic the nonparalytic polio symptoms for about a week, increasing symptoms of severe muscle aches and spasms, loss of reflexes, and flaccid paralysis (limbs become floppy) begin to develop. In some individuals, the paralysis may occur very quickly (within a few hours after infection occurs). Sometimes the paralysis is only on one side of the body. The musculature involved with breathing may become inhibited or nonfunctional, and these patients need assistance with breathing. muscle pain, joint pain, and spinal changes such as scoliosis, spondylosis, and/or secondary nerve root and peripheral nerve compression."
Is it possible to prevent polio? Is there a polio vaccine?,"'It is possible to prevent polio by stimulating your immune system with vaccination.''Although some people who get the inactivated polio vaccine may have a sore area at the shot site, most people have no problems with the vaccine injection, which usually causes no ''scar'' formation. ''Smallpox'' ''vaccines'' often left a small ''scar'' at the inoculation site.''Because oral polio vaccine has weakened (attenuated) but live viruses (not as effective as wild-type polio viruses in causing symptoms), occasionally some of the weakened oral vaccine viruses may pass through the feces and infect other people. This is rare; the WHO reports fewer than 760 people worldwide vaccine-derived after administering over 10 billion oral doses.'   Vaccinating individuals, especially young children, can establish lifelong immunity to the disease. The inactivated polio vaccine needs to be given at 2, 4, and between 6 and 18 months of age with a booster between ages 4-6. In 2002, the inactivated polio vaccine was approved to be used as a shot combined with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hepatitis B vaccines. However, the CDC still recommends that people traveling to countries were polio is present receive a polio booster shot before they travel. In addition, those people who care for polio patients need to be sure they have been appropriately vaccinated and still should use strict hygiene when caring for those patients."
What causes polio?,"'Polio is caused by small RNA viruses. They are members of the ''enterovirus'' group of the Picornavirus family. There are three types (types 1, 2, and 3) of polio viruses; type I is responsible for about 85% of all paralytic infections. These types are antigenically distinct ''strains'' of viruses and infection or immunity to one type does not protect against the other two types, however, if immunity is established to one or all of the three strains, immunity is lifelong. The problem that these viruses cause is the destruction of spinal cord cells (specifically, the anterior horn cells).' "
What are risk factors for polio? How does polio spread?,"'Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) have certified that the Americas, Western Pacific, and Europe are polio free. Other areas have a low incidence of polio, but people in war zones where ''vaccinations'' have been interrupted are at a risk getting polio (for example, Afghanistan and Syria). The greatest risk factor for polio is not being vaccinated. People with immunodeficiency (''HIV'', ''cancer'' patients, ''chemotherapy'' patients, for example), very young individuals, ''pregnant'' females, caregivers for polio patients, ''travelers'' to areas were polio is endemic, and lab personnel who work with live polioviruses are at increased risk for polio.''Polio, like smallpox, only infects humans. Polio spreads by person-to-person contact; the virus lives in the throat and in the ''intestines'' and is spread through contact with the feces (fecal-oral spread) or by droplet spread in a sneeze or ''cough''. It can also be spread by an infected person who has contaminated food or fluids by touching or tasting them. Unfortunately, a person can be infectious and transmit the virus even before they develop any symptoms.' "
How do physicians diagnose polio?,"""A physician may make a preliminary diagnosis of polio from the patient's history and physical examination. For example, if the patient has not been vaccinated and has had contact with individuals who have polio and has symptoms such as muscle ""'stiffness'' and difficulty with limb movements, breading or swallowing, then a preliminary diagnosis is made.'""A definitive diagnosis is done by cultivating poliovirus from the patient's ""'mucus'', ''stool'', and/or cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, there are serological tests that detect antibodies directed against poliovirus.' "
What is the treatment for polio?,"'Once the virus that causes polio has infected a person, there is no treatment that will cure polio. Early diagnosis and supportive treatments such as bed rest, ''pain'' control, good ''nutrition'', and physical therapy to prevent deformities from occurring over time can help reduce the long-term symptoms due to muscle loss. Some patients, unfortunately, may require extensive support and care.''For example, some require breathing assistance and ''special diets'' if they have ''difficulty swallowing'' while other patients may require splints and/or leg ''braces'' to avoid extremity ''pain'', ''muscle spasms'', and limb deformities. Some improvement in the symptoms may occur over time, but this improvement is not easily predictable and varies from patient to patient. For example, in the past, patients who needed breathing assistance would be treated with the iron lung. Over time, some would improve and no longer would require iron lung therapy.' "
What is the prognosis of polio?,"'The prognosis for patients with polio depends on the extent of damage caused by the poliovirus. Many patients may have few if any symptoms and will have an excellent prognosis. However, the prognosis worsens when patients begin to show symptoms of paralysis, especially with decreased ability to breathe or swallow. Many patients who develop more severe polio symptoms progress to lifelong disabilities or death.' "
Polio-like illness,"'In 2014 in California, an outbreak of an illness that resembled polio was identified which retrospectively dated back to 2012. It is now called ''acute flaccid myelitis''. All of the affected children (about 59 through July 2015) developed a rapid onset of paralysis in one or more limbs and ''MRI'' findings were consistent with injury to the central spinal cord. All of the children had been vaccinated against polio. Some of the children were positive for ''enterovirus''-68, a virus known to be associated with limb paralysis and breathing difficulties. The CDC and researchers are currently trying to definitively determine the cause of this illness although they agree it is not polio.''To date, the children, ranging ages 2 to young adults, have not responded to steroid or immunoglobin treatments, with only 16% gradually improving over time. This new outbreak of polio-like illness is being intensely investigated by agents from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention''.' "
Facts you should know about polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),"   Polyarteritis nodosa is an autoimmune disease that affects arteries. Common areas affected include the muscles, joints, intestines (bowels), nerves, kidneys, and skin. Diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed by a biopsy of involved tissue or angiography. Treatment is directed toward decreasing the inflammation of the arteries."
What is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare autoimmune disease featuring spontaneous inflammation of the arteries (arteritis, a form of blood vessel inflammation or ""''vasculitis''""). Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an overactive, misdirected immune system that attacks one\'s own body. Because arteries are involved, the disease can affect any organ of the body. The most common areas of involvement include the muscles, joints, intestines (bowels), nerves, kidneys, and skin. Poor function or ''pain'' in any of these organs can be a symptom. Poor blood supply to the bowels can cause ''abdominal pain'', local bowel death, and bleeding. ''Fatigue'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever'' are common. Polyarteritis nodosa is often abbreviated PAN.' "
What are causes and risk factors for polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa is most common in middle-age people. Its cause is unknown, but it has been reported after ''hepatitis B'' infection. Polyarteritis is not felt to be an ''inherited'' condition.' "
What are symptoms and signs of polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis nodosa causes symptoms and signs that are a result of injury to the blood vessels. Therefore, the symptoms and signs depend on which vessels are affected and to what degree. This can lead to organ damage or injury. For example, if blood vessels supplying the nerves or muscles are affected, the nerves or muscles can be damaged. If the blood vessels to the kidneys are affected, kidney damage with ''blood in the urine'' can result. Symptoms and signs can include ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''high blood pressure'', ''muscle pain'' (''myalgia''), ''joint pain'' (''arthralgia''), ''testicular pain'', livido reticularis, nerve damage, and ''abdominal pain''.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose polyarteritis nodosa?,"'The diagnosis is supported by tests that indicate inflammation including elevation of blood ''sedimentation rate'' and ''C-reactive protein''. The white blood cell count and ''platelet count'' can be elevated, while the red blood count is decreased (''anemia''). ''Hepatitis B'' virus (testing for either antigen or antibody) can be found in 10%-20% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa. Urine testing can show protein and ''red blood cells'' in the urine. In patients with nerves affected, nerve conduction tests are abnormal.''The diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed by a biopsy of involved tissue that reveals the inflamed blood vessels (''vasculitis''). Examples of tissues that are sometimes biopsied include nerves, muscle, kidneys, and bowel. Vasculitis of the bowel and kidneys can often be detected with an ''angiogram'' (X-ray testing while contrast ""dye"" is infused into the blood vessels).''The American College of ''Rheumatology'' established criteria for the classification of polyarteritis nodosa in 1990. For classification purposes (to group patients together for medical studies), a patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if at least three of the following 10 criteria are present:' Weight loss greater than/equal to 4 kg Livedo reticularis (a mottled purplish skin discoloration over the extremities or torso) Testicular pain or tenderness (occasionally, a site biopsied for diagnosis) Muscle pain, weakness, or leg tenderness Nerve disease (either single or multiple) Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg (high blood pressure) Elevated kidney blood tests (BUN greater than 40 mg/dl or creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl) Hepatitis B virus tests positive (for surface antigen or antibody) Arteriogram (angiogram) showing the arteries that are dilated (aneurysms) or constricted by the blood vessel inflammation Biopsy of tissue showing the arteritis (typically inflamed arteries)"
What is the treatment for polyarteritis nodosa?,"'Polyarteritis is a serious illness that can be fatal. Treatment is directed toward decreasing the inflammation of the arteries by suppressing the immune system. Medications used to treat polyarteritis nodosa include high-dose intravenous and oral cortisone medications such as ''prednisone'', as well as immunosuppressive ''drugs'' such as ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran).''When ''hepatitis'' B is present in patients with polyarteritis, antiviral medications (such as vidarabine and ''interferon''-alpha) are used as primary treatments. Treatments have included various combinations of antiviral medications, plasma exchange, and immunosuppressive drugs.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) of polyarteritis nodosa?,"'The outlook for patients with polyarteritis nodosa depends on the degree of damage to affected organs and the response to treatments. For those patients with underlying ''hepatitis'' B infection, eradication of the virus is essential for optimal outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent polyarteritis nodosa?,'The only ''prevention'' for polyarteritis nodosa is to avoid the risk of hepatitis B.' 
What is PKD?,"'Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes many fluid-filled cysts to grow in your kidneys. Unlike the usually harmless simple kidney cysts that can form in the kidneys later in life, PKD cysts can change the shape of your kidneys, including making them much larger.''PKD is a form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that reduces kidney function and may lead to kidney failure. PKD also can cause other complications, or problems, such as high blood pressure, cysts in the liver, and problems with blood vessels in your brain and heart.'  "
"What are the causes, symptoms, and types of PKD?","'A gene mutation, or defect, causes PKD. In most PKD cases, a child got the gene mutation from a parent. In a small number of PKD cases, the gene mutation developed on its own, without either parent carrying a copy of the mutated gene. This type of mutation is called “spontaneous.” Read more about genes and genetic conditions.''Two of the common types of PDK are autosomal dominant PDK (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PK (ARPKD)' The signs and symptoms of and complications of ADPKD include pain,high blood pressure, andkidney failure, pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure, PKD does not cause signs or symptoms until your kidney cysts are a half inch or larger in size. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb are larger-than-normal kidneys and a smaller-than-average size baby, a condition called growth failure. The early signs of ARPKD are also complications. Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood or even adulthood. autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), which is usually diagnosed in adulthood autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD), which can be diagnosed in the womb or shortly after a baby is born"
What is autosomal dominant PKD and its symptoms and signs?,"   Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of PKD. ADPKD affects 1 in every 400 to 1,000 people and is the most common kidney disorder passed down through family members. Healthcare providers usually diagnose ADPKD between the ages of 30 and 50, when signs and symptoms start to appear, which is why it is sometimes called “adult PKD.” ""Autosomal dominant"" means you can get the PKD gene mutation, or defect, from only one parent. Researchers have found two different gene mutations that cause ADPKD. Most people with ADPKD have defects in the PKD1 gene, and 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 7 people with ADPKD have a defective PKD2 gene. Healthcare providers can diagnose people with PKD1 sooner because their symptoms appear sooner. People with PKD1 also usually progress more quickly to kidney failure than people with PKD2. How quickly ADPKD progresses also differs from person to person. In many cases, ADPKD doesn’t cause signs or symptoms until cysts are a half inch or larger in size. For this reason, you should meet with a healthcare provider if you are at risk for PKD before your symptoms start. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) The most common symptoms are pain in the back and sides, between the ribs and hips, and headaches. The pain can be short term or ongoing, mild or severe. Hematuria, or blood in the urine, may be a sign of ADPKD. If you have symptoms or signs of hematuria, see a healthcare provider right away.

What are common and other complications of ADPKD?,"'Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Common and other complications of ADPKD\xa0include:''Pain.'' Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused by''High blood pressure.'' Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage.''Kidney failure.\xa0''Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to ''coma'' and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70.''Kidney cancer''.'' ADPKD complications, or problems, can affect many systems in your body besides your kidneys. Researchers have not found a link between PKD and kidney ''cancer''.''Abnormal heart valves.'' Abnormal heart valves can occur in some people with ADPKD. Abnormal heart valves can cause too little blood to flow into the ''aorta'', the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of your body. Abnormal heart valves in people with ADPKD rarely need to be replaced. However, you may need more tests if your healthcare provider detects a ''heart murmur''.''Brain aneurysms. ''An ''aneurysm'' is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Aneurysms in the brain might cause ''headaches'' that are severe or feel different from other headaches. See a healthcare provider even before you take ''over-the-counter'' pain medicines for severe headaches or headaches that won’t go away.''Brain aneurysms can break open and cause bleeding inside the skull. Large brain aneurysms are life threatening and need immediate medical treatment. If you have an ''aneurysm'', stop ''smoking'' and control your blood pressure and ''lipids''.''Liver cysts.'' Liver cysts, which are fluid-filled cysts on the liver, are the most common nonkidney complication of ADPKD. Liver cysts don’t usually cause symptoms in people under age 30, because liver cysts are normally small and few in number in the early stages of ADPKD. In rare cases, liver cysts can eventually reduce ''liver function''. In the most severe cases, you may need a liver transplant.''Because the hormone estrogen may affect ''liver cyst'' growth, women are more likely to have liver cysts than men. The more ''pregnancies'' a woman with ADPKD has had, the more likely she will have liver cysts.''Pancreatic cysts.'' PKD can also cause cysts in your pancreas. Pancreatic cysts rarely cause ''pancreatitis'', which is inflammation, or swelling, of the pancreas.''Diverticula. ''Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that push through weak spots in your colon wall. Diverticula can cause ''diverticulosis''. ''Diverticulosis'' can cause changes in your bowel movement patterns or pain in your abdomen.''Urinary tract infections'' (UTIs).'' Kidney cysts can block urine flow through the kidneys so that urine stays in your urinary tract too long. When urine stays in your urinary tract too long, bacteria in your urine can cause a ''bladder infection'' or a ''kidney infection''. A kidney infection can cause further damage to your kidneys by causing cysts to become infected.''Kidney stones.'' People with ADPKD sometimes have kidney stones. Kidney stones can block urine flow and cause infection and pain.''Although most women with PKD have normal pregnancies, women with PKD who have high blood pressure and decreased kidney function are more likely to have ''preeclampsia'', or high blood pressure during ''pregnancy''.''With ''preeclampsia'', the fetus gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Women with preeclampsia should be followed closely by their health care provider during and after pregnancy. After delivery, preeclampsia goes away.''Many men with ADPKD have cysts on their seminal vesicles, which are glands in the male reproductive system that help produce semen. Seminal vesicle cysts rarely cause ''infertility''.''People with PKD who are considering having children may want to discuss ''family planning'' concerns with a genetics counselor.' kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. You may see some ADPKD complications right away. Other complications may not appear for many years, depending on whether you have the PKD1 or PKD2 gene. ADPKD complications can vary from person to person, so you may not have all of these problems."
What procedures and tests diagnose PDK?,"'Health care providers diagnose ADPKD using imaging tests and genetic testing. A healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on these tests and your age, family history of PKD, and how many cysts you have.\xa0The sooner a healthcare provider can diagnose ADPKD, the better your chances of delaying complications.''A specially trained technician performs imaging tests in a healthcare provider’s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital.\xa0 A radiologist reads the images.\xa0 Adults usually don’t need anesthesia for these tests. However, a healthcare\xa0provider may give infants or children a sedative to help them fall asleep during the test.''Ultrasound. ''Ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe, painless sound waves off your organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of your entire urinary tract or focus specifically on the kidneys. The images can show cysts in the kidneys.''Computed tomography (CT) scans. ''CT scans'' use a combination of ''x-rays'' and computer technology to create images of your urinary tract. For a ''CT scan'' of your urinary tract, a health care provider may give you an injection of contrast medium. Contrast medium is a dye or other substance that makes structures inside your body easier to see during imaging tests. You lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes the x-rays. CT scans can show more detailed images of kidney cysts than ultrasound.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI). ''MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of your body’s internal organs and soft tissues without using x-rays. An MRI may include an injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, you lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine that may be open on each end or closed at one end. Some newer machines allow you to lie in a more open space. Health care providers use ''MRIs'' to measure kidney and cyst size and monitor kidney and cyst growth. Measuring kidney and cyst size and growth can help track the progress of PKD.' "
How are the most common complications of ADPKD treated?,"'Although a cure doesn’t exist yet for ADPKD, treatment can help reduce your complications, which can help you live longer.''A health care provider needs to find the source of your pain before he or she can treat it. For example, if growing cysts are causing pain, the health care provider may first suggest over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines such as ''aspirin'' or ''acetaminophen''.''Always talk with a health care provider before taking any OTC medicines because some may be harmful to your kidneys. People with ADPKD have a higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), which is the sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. Sometimes AKI is caused by using OTC painkillers for a long time.''Depending on the size and number of cysts and whether medicine helps your pain, a health care provider may suggest surgery. Surgery to shrink cysts can help pain in your back and sides for a while. However, surgery does not slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure.''Controlling your blood pressure can slow the effects of ADPKD. Lifestyle changes and medicines can lower high blood pressure. Sometimes you can control blood pressure with healthy eating and regular physical activity alone.''Some health care providers will recommend blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'').''ADPKD can eventually cause your kidneys to fail. People with kidney failure must have dialysis or a kidney transplant to replace their kidney function.''The two forms of dialysis are ''hemodialysis'' and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate your blood through a filter outside the body. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen to filter the blood inside the body.''A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a donor into your body.' "
What is autosomal recessive ARPKD?,"'Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 20,000 children. A fetus or baby with ARPKD has fluid-filled kidney cysts that may make the kidneys too big, or enlarged. ARPKD can cause a child to have poor kidney function, even in the womb. ARPKD is sometimes called “infantile PKD” because health care providers can diagnose it so early in life.''Poor kidney function can cause breathing problems that can threaten the life of a fetus or baby. About 30 percent of newborns with ARPKD die within their first week of life. A baby with ARPKD who survives birth and the first few weeks of life has a good chance of surviving into adulthood. However, children or young adults with ARPKD will likely need medical treatment their whole life.''""Autosomal recessive"" means that for a child to have this disorder, both parents must have and pass along the gene mutation. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disorder, although the child may get the gene mutation. The child is a “carrier” of the disorder and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation.''How quickly ARPKD progresses to kidney failure is different for each child. The sooner a fetus is diagnosed in the womb, the better the child’s outlook. Getting good ''prenatal care'' is important for increasing a child’s survival rate. Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help parents manage their child’s PKD.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of ARPKD?,"'The early signs of ARPKD often appear during the first few months of life and in the womb. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb can cause serious health problems. For this reason, it is important for a woman who is at risk for passing PKD to her children to get ''prenatal'' care as soon as she learns she is ''pregnant''.''Enlarged kidney.'' An early sign of ARPKD is an enlarged kidney. Enlarged kidneys put pressure on a fetus’ or child’s lungs, which can make lung growth and breathing harder. A health care provider can see enlarged kidneys in a fetus or an infant using ultrasound imaging, also called a ''sonogram''.''Growth failure. ''Due to decreased kidney and lung function, children with ARPKD are usually smaller-than-average size, a condition called growth failure.''Low levels of amniotic fluid. ''Decreased kidney function can cause low levels of amniotic fluid in a mother’s womb. Low levels of amniotic fluid can cause breathing problems in the fetus.''Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood, or even adulthood.' "
How are the common complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Health care providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help manage these complications.''Breathing problems in infants''Liver problems''High blood pressure in children'   Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused bykidney cyst infection,bleeding or burst kidney cysts,urinary tract infection,kidney stones,tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and  high blood pressure. Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage. Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to coma and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70. Children with ARPKD who survive birth often have kidney and liver problems that can affect their breathing. Children born with ARPKD often develop kidney failure before reaching adulthood. Babies with the most severe cases of ARPKD often die hours or days after birth because they cannot breathe well enough to live. Their lungs do not develop as they should in the womb. Liver scarring occurs in all cases of ARPKD and is usually present at birth. Liver scarring can lead to decreased liver function and other liver problems. However, liver problems from ARPKD tend to become more of a concern over time.  Most children with ARPKD have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases a child’s chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also further damage a child’s kidneys."
How are other complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Healthcare providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Enlarged kidney. ''Kidney enlargement cannot be prevented or reversed. One or both kidneys may need to be removed if their size makes breathing impossible. Children who don’t have working kidneys will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.''Growth failure.'' A health care provider may treat growth failure with nutritional therapy . In severe cases of growth failure, a health care provider and a child’s parents may consider treatment with human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is a prescribed, man-made hormone that can help children grow.''Breathing problems.'' Health care providers treat infants with breathing problems with artificial ventilation, which allows them to breathe with the help of a machine.''Kidney failure. ''Peritoneal dialysis is the preferred method of treating children with kidney failure, although health care providers also use hemodialysis. Kidney transplants may be a limited option for infants because of their size.''Liver problems. ''If serious ''liver disease'' develops, some children may need to have a combined liver and kidney transplant.''High blood pressure.'' A health care provider can help control blood pressure with medicines. Treating high blood pressure can help delay kidney failure.' "
Can diet and lifestyle changes slow the progression of PKD?,"'Your healthcare provider will use lab tests to watch your levels of these ''minerals''.''If lifestyle and diet changes don’t help control your blood pressure, a health care provider may prescribe one or more blood pressure medicines. Two types of blood pressure medicines, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may slow kidney disease and delay kidney failure. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan.''If you have any kind of chronic kidney disease, including polycystic kidney disease (PKD), talk with a dietitian about which foods to include in your diet and which foods might be harmful. Find a dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease to help you choose the right foods and plan healthy meals.' The sooner you know you or your child has PKD, the sooner you can keep the condition from getting worse. Getting tested if you or your child are at risk for PKD can help you take early action.  PKD may require diet changes to help lower your blood pressure by limiting how much sodium (salt) you eat. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein also can help protect the kidneys. As your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods lower in phosphorus and potassium. You may need to change what you eat and drink to help control your blood pressure and protect your kidneys. People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about which foods and drinks to include in their healthy eating plan and which may be harmful. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Be active for 30 minutes or more on most days. Regular physical activity can help you reduce stress, manage your weight, and control your blood pressure. If you are not active now, ask your health care provider about how much and what type of physical activity is right for you. If you play contact sports, such as football or hockey, a healthcare provider should do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test to see whether these sports are safe for you. Trauma to your body, especially to your back and sides, may cause kidney cysts to burst. Lose weight. Being overweight makes your kidneys work harder. Losing weight helps protect your kidneys. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Getting enough sleep is important to your overall physical and mental health and can help you manage your blood pressure and blood glucose, or blood sugar. Reduce stress. Long-term stress can raise your blood pressure and even lead to depression. Some of the steps you take to manage your PKD are also healthy ways to cope with stress. For example, getting enough physical activity and sleep helps reduce stress. Quit smoking. Cigarette smoking can raise your blood pressure, making your kidney damage worse. Quitting smoking may help you meet your blood pressure goals, which is good for your kidneys and can lower your chances of having a heart attack or stroke. Quitting smoking is even more important for people with PKD who have aneurysms. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Take blood pressure medications."
How does ADPKD affect your day-to-day life?,"'Managing PKD successfully will probably include several lifestyle changes, such as changes in your physical activity level and what you eat. Visiting with a health care team on a regular basis is an important part of your routine as you work to limit your kidney problems.''PKD is a costly disease to manage and treat, especially if health insurance doesn’t cover some or any of your costs. Financial help may be available from the Federal Government and other sources. Visit the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website or talk with your health care team for more information.''Many people with PKD may find it hard, but not impossible, to get life insurance. Contact an insurance company that specializes in “impaired risk life insurance.”' "
Can you prevent PKD?,"'Researchers have not yet found a way to prevent PKD. However, you may be able to slow PKD problems caused by high blood pressure, such as kidney damage. Aim for a blood pressure goal of less than 120/80. Work with a health care team to help manage your or your child’s PKD. The health care team will probably include a general practitioner and a nephrologist, a health care provider specializing in kidney health.' "
What is genetic testing?,"'Your healthcare provider may refer you to a geneticist if you are at risk for ADPKD. A geneticist is an expert in genes and diseases that are passed down through families. You will provide the geneticist with a blood or saliva sample, which will be tested in a special lab for the gene mutations that cause ADPKD. The genetic testing may take many days or weeks to complete.''A healthcare provider may also use genetic testing results to find out whether someone with a family history of PKD is likely to develop PKD in the future.' "
When should you consider genetic counseling?,"'If you are considering genetic testing, you and your family may want to talk with a genetics counselor as part of your health care team. Genetic counseling may be useful when you’re deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available. Genetic counseling can help you and your family understand how test results may affect your lives.' "
What is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"'Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), also known by the name Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a hormonal problem that causes women to have a variety of symptoms. It should be noted that most women with the condition have a number of small ''cysts'' in the ovaries. However, women may have cysts in the ovaries for a number of reasons, and it is the characteristic constellation of symptoms, rather than the presence of the cysts themselves, that is important in establishing the PCOS diagnosis.''PCOS occurs in 5% to 10% of women and is the most common cause of''infertility''  in women. PCOS symptoms may begin in adolescence with menstrual irregularities , or a woman may not know she has PCOS until later in life when symptoms and/or ''infertility'' occur. Women of all ethnicities may be affected.' "
What are the symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"""PCOS's principal signs and symptoms are related to menstrual disturbances and elevated levels of male hormones (androgens). Menstrual disturbances can include delay of normal ""'menstruation'' (primary ''amenorrhea''), the presence of fewer than normal menstrual periods (oligomenorrhea), or the absence of ''menstruation'' for more than three months (secondary amenorrhea ). Menstrual cycles may not be associated with ''ovulation'' (anovulatory cycles) and may result in heavy bleeding.''Symptoms related to elevated ''androgen'' levels include ''acne'', excess hair growth on the body (hirsutism), and male-pattern ''hair loss''.''Other PCOS signs and symptoms include:''Any of the above symptoms and signs may be absent in PCOS, with the exception of irregular or no menstrual periods. All women with PCOS will have irregular or no menstrual periods. Women who have PCOS do not ovulate regularly; that is, they do not release an egg every month. This is why they do not have regular periods and typically have difficulty conceiving.'   obesity and weight gain, elevated insulin levels and insulin resistance, oily skin, dandruff, infertility, skin discolorations, high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, and multiple small cysts in the ovaries."
What causes polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)?,"'No one is quite sure what causes PCOS, and it is likely to be the result of a number of both genetic (''inherited'') as well as environmental factors. Women with PCOS often have a mother or sister with the condition, and researchers are examining the role that genetics or gene mutations might play in its development. The ovaries of women with PCOS frequently contain a number of small cysts, hence the name poly=many cystic ovarian syndrome. A similar number of cysts may occur in women without PCOS. Therefore, the cysts themselves do not seem to be the cause of the problem.'""A malfunction of the body's blood ""'sugar'' control system (insulin system) is frequent in women with PCOS, who often have insulin resistance and elevated blood insulin levels. Researchers believe that these abnormalities may be related to the development of PCOS. It is also known that the ovaries of women with PCOS produce excess amounts of male hormones known as androgens. This excessive production of male hormones may be a result of or related to the abnormalities in insulin production.''Another hormonal abnormality in women with PCOS is the excessive production of luteinizing hormone (LH), which is produced by the ''pituitary gland'', which is involved in stimulating the ovaries to produce hormones.''Other possible contributing factors in the development of PCOS may include a low level of chronic inflammation in the body and fetal exposure to male hormones.' "
How is PCOS diagnosed?,"'The PCOS diagnosis is generally made through clinical signs and symptoms. The doctor will want to exclude other illnesses that have similar features, such as ''low thyroid hormone'' blood levels (''hypothyroidism'') or elevated levels of a milk-producing hormone (''prolactin''). Also, tumors of the ovary or adrenal glands can produce elevated male hormone (androgen) blood levels that cause ''acne'' or excess hair growth, thus mimicking the symptoms of PCOS.''Other laboratory tests can be helpful in making the diagnosis of PCOS. Serum levels of male hormones ( DHEA and testosterone ) may be elevated. However, levels of testosterone that are highly elevated are common with PCOS and call for additional evaluation. Additionally, levels of luteinizing hormone involved in ovarian hormone production are elevated.''The cysts (fluid filled sacs) in the ovaries can be identified with imaging technology. (However, as noted above, women without PCOS can have many cysts as well.) ''Ultrasound'' , which passes sound waves through the body to create a picture of the kidneys, is used most often to look for cysts in the ovaries. Ultrasound imaging employs no injected dyes or ''radiation'' and is safe for all patients including ''pregnant'' women. It can also detect cysts in the kidneys of a fetus. Because women without PCOS can have ''ovarian cysts'' , and because ''ovarian cysts'"" are not part of the definition of PCOS, ultrasound is not routinely ordered to diagnose PCOS. The diagnosis is usually a clinical one based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory testing.""'More powerful and expensive imaging methods such as computed tomography (''CT scan'') and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') can also detect cysts, but they are generally reserved for situations in which other conditions that may cause related symptoms, such as ovarian or adrenal gland tumors are suspected. ''CT scans'' require ''X-rays'' and sometimes injected dyes, which can be associated with some degree of complications in certain patients.'  "
What conditions or complications can be associated with PCOS?,"'Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for a number of illnesses, including ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'' , and ''cancer of the uterus''(''endometrial cancer'').''Because of the menstrual and hormonal irregularities, infertility is common in women with PCOS. Because of the lack of ovulation, ''progesterone'' secretion in women with PCOS is diminished, leading to long-term unopposed estrogen stimulation of the uterine lining. This situation can lead to abnormal periods, breakthrough bleeding, or prolonged uterine bleeding. Unopposed estrogen stimulation of the uterus is also a risk factor for the development of endometrial hyperplasia and ''cancer of the endometrium'' (uterine lining). However, medications can be given to induce regular periods and reduce the estrogenic stimulation of the ''endometrium'' (see below).''Obesity is associated with PCOS. Obesity not only compounds the problem of insulin resistance and ''type 2 diabetes'' (see below), but also imparts cardiovascular risks. PCOS and obesity are associated with a higher risk of developing ''metabolic syndrome'' , a group of symptoms, including ''high blood pressure'', that increase the chances of developing ''cardiovascular disease''. It has also been shown that levels of ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP), a biochemical marker that can predict the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, are elevated in women with PCOS. Reducing the medical risks from PCOS-associated obesity is important.''The risk of developing ''prediabetes'' and ''type 2 diabetes'' is increased in women with PCOS, particularly if they have a family history of ''diabetes''. Obesity and insulin resistance, both associated with PCOS, are significant risk factor for the development of ''type 2 diabetes''. Several studies have shown that women with PCOS have abnormal levels of LDL (""bad"") ''cholesterol'' and lowered levels of ''HDL'' (""good"") cholesterol in the blood. Elevated levels of blood ''triglycerides'' have also been described in women with PCOS.''Changes in skin pigmentation can also occur with PCOS. ''Acanthosis nigricans'' refers to the presence of velvety, brown to black pigmentation often seen on the neck, under the arms, or in the groin. This condition is associated with obesity and insulin resistance and occurs in some women with PCOS.'  "
What treatments are available for PCOS?,"""Treatment of PCOS depends partially on the woman's stage of life. For younger women who desire ""'birth control'', the ''birth control pill'', especially those with low androgenic (male hormone-like) side effects can cause regular periods and prevent the risk of ''uterine cancer''. Another option is intermittent therapy with the hormone progesterone. Progesterone therapy will induce menstrual periods and reduce the risk of uterine ''cancer'', but will not provide ''contraceptive'' protection.''For ''acne'' or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') may be prescribed to help reverse these problems. The use of spironolactone requires occasional monitoring of blood tests because of its potential effect on the blood potassium levels and kidney function. ''Eflornithine'' (''Vaniqa'') is a prescription cream that can be used to slow facial hair growth in women.''Electrolysis'' and ''over-the-counter'' depilatory creams are other options for controlling excess hair growth.''For women who desire ''pregnancy'', a medication called ''clomiphene'' (''Clomid'') can be used to induce ovulation (cause egg production). In addition, ''weight loss'' can normalize menstrual cycles and often increases the possibility of pregnancy in women with PCOS. Other, more aggressive, treatments for infertility (including injection of gonadotropin hormones and assisted reproductive technologies) may also be required in women who desire pregnancy and do not become pregnant on Clomid therapy.''Metformin''(''Glucophage'') is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. This drug affects the action of insulin and is useful in reducing a number of the symptoms and complications of PCOS. Metformin has been shown to be useful in the management of irregular periods, ovulation induction, ''weight loss'', as well as the\xa0''prevention'' of type 2 diabetes and\xa0''gestational diabetes'' mellitus in women with PCOS.''Obesity that occurs with PCOS needs to be treated because it can cause numerous additional medical problems. The management of obesity in PCOS is similar to the management of obesity in general. ''Weight loss'' can help reduce or prevent many of the complications associated with PCOS, including type 2 diabetes and ''heart disease''. Consultation with a dietician on a frequent basis is helpful until just the right individualized program is established for each woman.''Finally, a surgical procedure known as ovarian drilling can help induce ovulation in some women who have not responded to other treatments for PCOS. In this procedure a small portion of ovarian tissue is destroyed by an electric current delivered through a needle inserted into the ovary. This is an older procedure which is only rarely utilized.'  "
What is polycythemia?,"'Polycythemia is a condition that results in an increased level of circulating ''red blood cells'' in the bloodstream. People with polycythemia have an increase in ''hematocrit'', ''hemoglobin'', or red blood cell count above the normal limits.''Polycythemia is normally reported in terms of increased ''hematocrit'' (hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of ''red blood cells'' to the total volume of blood) or ''hemoglobin'' concentration (hemoglobin is a protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood).''Polycythemia can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary.''Red cell production (erythropoiesis) takes place in the bone marrow through a complex sequence of tightly regulated steps. The main regulator of the red cell production is the hormone ''erythropoietin'' (EPO). This hormone is largely secreted by the kidneys, although, about 10% may be produced and secreted by the ''liver''.''Erythropoietin secretion is up-regulated in response to low oxygen levels (''hypoxia'') in the blood. More oxygen can be carried to tissues when erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow to compensate for the hypoxia.''Neonatal'' (''newborn'') polycythemia can be seen in 1% to 5% of newborns. The most common causes may be related to transfusion of blood, transfer of placental blood to the infant after delivery, or chronic inadequate oxygenation of the fetus (intrauterine hypoxia) due to placental insufficiency.'   Hematocrit (HCT): Polycythemia is considered when the hematocrit is greater than 48% in women and 52% in men. Hemoglobin (HGB): Polycythemia is considered when there is a hemoglobin level of greater than 16.5g/dL in women or hemoglobin level greater than18.5 g/dL in men. Primary polycythemia: In primary polycythemia the increase in red blood cells is caused by inherent problems in the process of red blood cell production. Secondary polycythemia: Secondary polycythemia generally occurs as a response to other factors or underlying conditions that promote red blood cell production."
What are the symptoms and signs of polycythemia?,"'Symptoms of polycythemia can be none to minimal in many people. Some general and non-specific polycythemia symptoms include:''In patients with polycythemia vera, other ''blood disorders'' are also very common. Thus, bleeding problems or clotting events may occur in these patients. ''Itching'' after showers or baths (post-bath pruritus) can also occur in patients with polycythemia vera for unclear reasons. ''Joint pains'' also are common in patients with polycythemia vera. Tender redness of the palms and soles is called erythromelalgia.''Symptoms of secondary polycythemia may be more closely attributed to the underlying condition, such as, chronic lung disease, than to polycythemia itself. Therefore, ''shortness of breath'', ''chronic cough'', ''sleep'' disturbance (''sleep'' apnea), ''dizziness'', poor ''exercise'' tolerance, or ''fatigue'' may be common in patients with polycythemia.''If polycythemia is related to kidney ''cancer'', ''liver'' ''cancer'', or other erythropoietin secreting tumors, the symptoms of these conditions -- such as, ''weight loss'', ''abdominal pain'' or fullness, or ''jaundice'' -- may be predominant.'   weakness, fatigue, headache, itching, bruising, joint pain, dizziness, or abdominal pain."
What are the normal ranges for red blood cells?," Hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. The normal range for hematocrit varies between sexes and is approximately 45% to 52% for men and 37% to 48% for women. Red cell count signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range in men is approximately 4.7 to 6.1 million cells/ul (microliter). The normal range in women ranges from 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/ul, according to NIH (National Institutes of Health) data. Hemoglobin is a protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color. The normal range for hemoglobin may differ between the sexes and is approximately 13 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women."
What causes a high red blood cell count?,"'Causes of polycythemia are primary or secondary. In primary polycythemia, abnormalities in red blood cell production cause an increase in ''red cell count''. In secondary polycythemia, factors external to red blood cell production (for example, hypoxia, ''sleep apnea'', certain tumors) result in polycythemia.'  "
What causes primary polycythemia?,"'Causes of polycythemia are primary or secondary. In primary polycythemia, abnormalities in red blood cell production cause an increase in red cell count. In secondary polycythemia, factors external to red blood cell production (for example, hypoxia, ''sleep apnea'', certain tumors) result in polycythemia.''Primary polycythemias are due to acquired or ''inherited'' genetic mutations causing abnormally high levels of red blood cell precursors. Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) and polycythemia vera (PV) are in this category.''Polycythemia vera is a rare condition. One study indicated that there were 65,243 patients with PV in the United States in 2003. Polycythemia vera is typically associated with an elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) and ''platelet count'' (thrombocytosis). An ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly'') and low erythropoietin levels are other clinical features of polycythemia vera.''Until recently, the exact mechanism of polycythemia vera was not well understood. In 2005, genetic mutations of the JAK2 gene were found to be responsible for most cases of polycythemia vera. These mutations are thought to possibly increase the sensitivity of the red blood cell precursors to erythropoietin, thereby, increasing red blood cell production.''Primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP) is also thought to be caused by genetic mutations resulting in increased responsiveness to normal levels of erythropoietin. Most cases are caused by different mutations to the EPOR gene.' "
What causes secondary polycythemia?,"'Secondary polycythemia is usually caused by increased erythropoietin (EPO) production either in response to chronic hypoxia (low blood oxygen level) or from an erythropoietin secreting ''tumor''.''Common conditions causing chronic hypoxia are chronic lung diseases such as:''Abnormal blood flow to the kidneys can be perceived by the kidneys as decreased oxygenation (renal hypoxia), even though, other tissues may have normal oxygenation. Renal hypoxia may promote an increase in erythropoietin production. This condition can occur after kidney transplantation or narrowing of renal arteries (blood vessels supplying the kidneys).''People living in high altitudes can develop polycythemia. In high altitudes, increased red blood cell production occurs in order to compensate for the low ambient oxygen levels and inadequate tissue oxygenation.''Rare ''congenital defects'' in the hemoglobin molecule, such as 2, 3-BPG deficiency, can result in a higher oxygen affinity by hemoglobin. In these conditions, oxygen is held on tightly by hemoglobin and is less readily released from hemoglobin to the tissues. The resulting tissue hypoxia from poor oxygen delivery may lead to polycythemia.''Certain tumors can release an increased amount of erythropoietin. The most common erythropoietin secreting tumors are:''Occasionally, benign kidney ''cysts'' and kidney obstruction (''hydronephrosis'') can also secrete extra erythropoietin causing polycythemia.''A rare genetic condition, called Chuvash polycythemia, causes increased activity of the gene that produces erythropoietin. The overproduction of erythropoietin causes polycythemia.' emphysema and chronic bronchitis which are collectively known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypoventilation syndrome, chronic heart diseases (congestive heart failure, or abnormal flow of blood from the right side to the left side of the heart), sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), adrenal adenoma (adenocarcinomas), and uterine (womb) tumors."
What are stress and smokers polycythemia?,"'Stress'"" polycythemia is a term applied to a chronic (long-standing) state of low plasma volume, which is seen commonly in active, hard-working, anxious, middle-aged men. In these people, the red blood cell volume is normal, but the plasma volume is low. This condition is also known as Gaisbock's disease, ""'stress'' erythrocytosis, or pseudopolycythemia.'""Smoker's polycythemia is a similar condition in which increased levels of deoxygenated hemoglobin (hemoglobin that does not carry oxygen, instead carrying carbon dioxide) causes an increase in red blood cell counts."" "
What is relative polycythemia?,"'In some forms of secondary polycythemia, the hemoglobin or red blood cell count is perceived to be abnormally high due to an increased concentration of blood. This can happen as a result of plasma volume loss from ''dehydration'', severe ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'', or ''excessive sweating''. Polycythemia in these situations may be called ''relative polycythemia'', because the actual numbers of red blood cells are not abnormal.' "
Can other sources of erythropoietin (EPO) cause polycythemia?,"'Erythropoietin (EPO) has been made synthetically for clinical treatment of certain types of ''anemia''. Some professional athletes have used this type of injectable EPO (blood doping) to improve their performance in competitions by producing more hemoglobin and, therefore, improving the delivery of oxygen to their tissues, mainly muscles. This type of doping practice is banned by many professional sport committees.' "
What are the risk factors for polycythemia?," Hypoxia from long standing (chronic) lung disease and smoking are common causes of polycythemia. Therefore, smoking can be a significant risk factor for polycythemia. Chronic carbon monoxide (CO) exposure can also be a risk factor for polycythemia. Hemoglobin has a higher affinity for CO than for oxygen; therefore, as it replaces oxygen in favor of CO, polycythemia may ensue to compensate for the low oxygen carried by hemoglobin. Chronic carbon monoxide exposure is a risk factor for people working in underground tunnels or parking garages, cab drivers in highly polluted and congested cities, or workers in factories with exposure to engine exhaust. People living at high altitudes may also be at risk of developing polycythemia due to low environmental oxygen levels. People with genetic mutations and familial types of polycythemia and certain hemoglobin abnormalities also carry risk factors for this condition as mentioned in earlier sections."
When should you call a doctor for polycythemia?,"'In cases of unstoppable bleeding (hemorrhage), severe ''breathing'' difficulty, ''shortness of breath'', or symptoms suggestive of a ''stroke'' (''weakness'' on one side or difficulty speaking, for example), seek a prompt evaluation by a physician or make an immediate visit to the emergency room.''People with polycythemia are seen routinely based on the recommendation of the treating doctor. Commonly these patients are seen by their primary care physicians, internists, lung doctors (pulmonologists), or blood specialists (hematology ''oncology'').' "
What tests confirm the diagnosis of polycythemia?,"'Polycythemia may be diagnosed incidentally on routine blood work. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell concentration are typically found on a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''). Repeating the laboratory tests (blood work) to confirm the diagnosis is usually advised to rule out possible laboratory or drawing errors.''More importantly, the cause of polycythemia needs to be determined. Medical history and physical examination are important components of the evaluation of polycythemia. The history usually includes questions about ''smoking'' history, living at high altitudes for extended periods, ''breathing'' difficulties, ''sleep'' disturbances, or chronic ''cough''. Other parts of the history may focus on a prior diagnosis of lung disease, ''heart disease'', kidney or liver ''cancer'', bleeding or clotting problems.''A complete physical examination -- including the assessment of body habitus (stature), vital signs, oxygen saturation, heart and lung exams, and evaluating for an ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly'') -- is essential in the evaluation of people with polycythemia.''Evidence of a long-standing low body oxygen level (chronic hypoxia) is an important clue in patients with polycythemia. Signs of long-standing hypoxia may include ''cyanosis'' (blue or purple appearing finger, nail, earlobes, or lips), ''clubbing'' of the fingers (elevation of the nail beds outward), or pursed lip breathing. Redness of the palms and soles may be another sign of polycythemia.''A ''chest X-ray'', ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG''), and ''echocardiogram'' may be performed to screen for lung disease or ''heart disease''. Hemoglobin analysis may be necessary if conditions with high affinity for oxygen or 2, 3-BPG deficiency are suspected. If carbon monoxide poisoning is in question, a blood test can detect its level.''Erythropoietin (EPO) blood levels may also be helpful, although the results need to be interpreted carefully, as the level may be high in response to chronic hypoxia. In polycythemia vera, the EPO levels are low as a response to an increased production of red blood cells. In tumors secreting erythropoietin, the EPO levels may be abnormally high.''The diagnosis of ''polycythemia vera'' requires special attention. There have been traditional diagnostic criteria for this condition. However, in 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the most recent guidelines. The guidelines include major and minor criteria.' The major criteria for polycythemia vera include a hemoglobin level of greater than 18.5 gram / deciliter in men or 16.5 gram / deciliter in women (or similar numbers based on the hematocrit) and the presence of JAK2 mutation. The minor criteria include bone marrow evidence of increased red blood cell production and decreased EPO levels."
What is the treatment for polycythemia?,"'The treatment for polycythemia is generally dependent on the cause.''In polycythemia vera or other primary polycythemia syndromes, the treatment options are more specific. Phlebotomy (drawing blood or blood letting) is the most essential part of the treatment. The recommended hematocrit of less than 45 in men and less than 42 in women is the goal of phlebotomy.''Several medications have been considered in conjunction with phlebotomy to suppress the abnormal production of red blood cells. Most of these chemotherapeutic ''drugs'' have been linked with side effects and their use has been controversial and limited.''The medication ''hydroxyurea'' (''Hydrea'') has been recommended for some patients with primary polycythemia and higher risk of ''blood clot'' formation due to high blood viscosity. The factors favoring treatment with hydroxyurea are age greater than 70, ''platelet count'' greater than 1.5 million, and general cardiovascular risk factors.''Aspirin'' and other anti-platelet agents (''dipyridamole'' [''Persantine'']) may also be beneficial in patients with polycythemia by reducing clotting complications, unless the patient has a history of bleeding problems.''In patients with secondary polycythemia, the goal is to treat the underlying condition. For example, in patients with lung or ''heart disease'' with hypoxia, appropriate management of these conditions along with oxygen supplementation is generally advised.'  "
What are the complications of polycythemia?,"'Potential complications of polycythemia vera are increased levels of circulating red blood cells, which increase the thickness or viscosity of the blood. This can be associated with higher risk of thrombus or clot formation leading to ''strokes'', ''heart attacks'', ''pulmonary embolism'', and possibly death.''Another complication of polycythemia vera is the potential transformation into a blood ''cancer'' (''leukemia''), excessive bleeding (hemorrhage), or clotting problems.''Because of high turnover of blood cells in polycythemia, the excretion of the byproducts of red blood cell degradation may overburden the kidneys and result in kidney dysfunction, ''kidney stones'', and ''gout''.''Finally, there is the potential for myelofibrosis (spent marrow), in which ''scar tissue'' eventually takes over the blood-forming marrow elements, resulting in ''anemia'' from marrow failure.''Complications of secondary polycythemia are typically related to those of the underlying disease. For example, chronic hypoxia from severe lung disease may be complicated by right-sided ''heart failure'' and pulmonary ''hypertension''. Chronic ''heart failure'' can lead to generalized swelling or ''edema'' (anasarca), ''low blood pressure'', kidney dysfunction, and poor functional status.''In ''neonatal'' (infant) polycythemia, increased blood thickness or viscosity can affect several organs due to poor blood flow. As a result, kidney dysfunction, intestinal problems, increased ''blood pressure'' in the ''lungs'', and hypoxia may ensue.' "
What is the life expectancy for polycythemia? Is it fatal?,"'The outlook on polycythemia depends on the underlying cause. Overall, the general outlook is favorable for people with this condition, especially those with secondary causes. The outlook for primary polycythemia is fair. While it is typically incurable and long standing, for many people, it is controllable and treatable. For example, untreated, polycythemia vera (PV) was initially thought to have a poor prognosis with a life expectancy of one to two years from the time of diagnosis. However, polycythemia vera prognosis is now greatly improved to 10 to 15 years survival after diagnosis with treatment by phlebotomy alone. The addition of medications, such as, hydroxyurea or ''aspirin'' may improve survival even more.' "
Can you prevent polycythemia?," Polycythemia due to a secondary cause such as long-standing smoking or exposure to carbon monoxide can be prevented by omitting these risks. Reducing risk factors for heart failure -- such as, controlling high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus -- can potentially reduce the risk of polycythemia. Congenital and primary polycythemia disorders, however, are not preventable."
What is PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient in that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA: ' Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied;  An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy; and  A pile of DNA building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."
How is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) done?,"'As illustrated in the ''animated picture of PCR'', three major steps are involved in a PCR. These three steps are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles. The cycles are done on an automated cycler, a device which rapidly heats and cools the test tubes containing the reaction mixture. Each step -- denatauration (alteration of structure), annealing (joining), and extension -- takes place at a different temperature: ''With one cycle, a single segment of double-stranded DNA template is amplified into two separate pieces of double-stranded DNA. These two pieces are then available for amplification in the next cycle. As the cycles are repeated, more and more copies are generated and the number of copies of the template is increased exponentially.' Denaturation: At 94 C (201.2 F), the double-stranded DNA melts and opens into two pieces of single-stranded DNA.  Annealing: At medium temperatures, around 54 C (129.2 F), the primers pair up (anneal) with the single-stranded ""template"" (The template is the sequence of DNA to be copied.) On the small length of double-stranded DNA (the joined primer and template), the polymerase attaches and starts copying the template.  Extension: At 72 C (161.6 F), the polymerase works best, and DNA building blocks complementary to the template are coupled to the primer, making a double stranded DNA molecule."
What is the purpose of doing a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'To do PCR, the original DNA that one wishes to copy need not be pure or abundant. It can be pure but it also can be a minute part of a mixture of materials. So, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses -- to diagnose genetic diseases, do DNA fingerprinting, find bacteria and ''viruses'', study human evolution, clone the DNA of an Egyptian mummy, establish paternity or biological relationships, etc.. Accordingly, PCR has become an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and many other laboratories that study genetic material.' "
How was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) discovered?,"'PCR was invented by Kary Mullis. At the time he thought up PCR in 1983, Mullis was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus, one of the first biotechnology companies. There, he was charged with making short chains of DNA for other scientists. Mullis has written that he conceived of PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway 128 one night on his motorcycle. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region. Mullis has said that before his motorcycle trip was over, he was already savoring the prospects of a Nobel Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith in 1993. ''As Mullis has written in the Scientific American: ""Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."" ' "
What is RT PCR?,"'RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA). The technique consists of two parts:''RT-PCR has been used to measure viral load with ''HIV'' and may also be used with other RNA viruses such as ''measles'' and ''mumps''.''Previous contributing author and editor: ''Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor:  Leslie J.

Facts you should know about polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)," Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a disease that causes pain and stiffness in muscles and joints, low-grade fever, and weight loss. Health care professionals diagnose PMR by characteristic common symptoms associated with abnormal blood testing for inflammation. Treatment of PMR involves taking low doses of cortisone medications."
What is polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disease of the muscles and joints characterized by ''muscle pain'' (''myalgia'') and stiffness, affecting both sides of the body, and involving the shoulders, arms, neck, and buttock areas. People with the disease are typically over 50 years of age. Polymyalgia rheumatica is abbreviated PMR.''PMR and ''temporal arteritis'' (''giant cell arteritis'') sometimes occur in the same patient. About 10%-15% of people with PMR also have ''giant cell arteritis''.' "
What are polymyalgia rheumatica causes and risk factors?,"'The cause of the condition is not known. Recent research has indicated that genetic (''inherited'') risk factors play a role in who becomes afflicted with the illness. Theories include viral stimulation of the immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. Rarely, the disease is associated with a ''cancer''. In this setting, the ''cancer'' may be initiating an inflammatory immune response to cause the polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms.' "
What are common symptoms and signs of polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The onset of the disease can be sudden. A patient may have a healthy history until awakening one morning with stiffness and ''pain'' of muscles and joints throughout the body, particularly in the upper arms, hips, neck, and shoulders. These pains can lead to a sensation of ''weakness'' and loss of function. Sometimes there is also muscle tenderness with PMR. These clinical symptoms persist and often include an intense sensation of ''fatigue''. Some patients notice a gradual ''loss of appetite'' accompanied by ''weight loss'' and ''lack of energy''. ''Depression'' can occur.'  "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The diagnosis of the disorder is suggested by the health history and physical examination. A health care professional frequently notes muscle tenderness and that the motion of the shoulders is limited by pain. The joints are usually not swollen. However, signs such as swelling of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and/or knees can occur. Blood testing for inflammation is generally abnormal, as indicated by a significant elevation in the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (sed rate or ESR) and/or ''C-reactive protein''. There are no specific tests, however, for the condition and ''X-rays'' are normal. The diagnosis is based on the characteristic history of persisting muscle and ''joint pain'' and stiffness associated with elevated blood tests for inflammation, such as the ESR. It is also not unusual for patients to have slight elevations of ''liver blood tests''.'  "
What is the medical treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'Doctors direct their medical treatment of PMR toward reducing pain and inflammation. While some patients with mild symptoms can improve with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), most patients respond best to low doses of ''corticosteroids'' (such as ''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone''). Not infrequently, a single day of cortisone medicine eases many of the symptoms! In fact, the rapid, gratifying results with low dose corticosteroids is characteristic of the condition.''The ''corticosteroid'' dose is gradually reduced while the doctor monitors the symptoms and normalization of the blood ESR. Reactivation of symptoms can require periodic adjustments in the prednisone dosage. Most patients are able to completely wean from the corticosteroid within several years. Some patients require longer-term medical treatment. Occasionally, patients have recurrence years after the symptoms have resolved. The ideal prednisone dosing regimen continues to be sought by clinical researchers.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with polymyalgia rheumatica?,"'The outlook for patients with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica is ultimately very good.''One of the keys to successful treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica is gradual, and not rapid, tapering of the medicines. This can avoid unwanted flare-ups of the disease.''Because the medicines prednisone and prednisolone are associated with potential bone toxicity, causing ''osteoporosis'', patients should consider calcium and ''vitamin D'' supplementation. ''Bone mineral density'' testing should be performed in appropriate patients, and doctors may consider prescribing ''osteoporosis'' medicines, such as estrogen, ''alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), and ''risedronate'' (''Actonel'') for some.' "
Is it possible to prevent polymyalgia rheumatica?,'There is no ''prevention'' for polymyalgia rheumatica. Prevention measures focus on preventing side effects of drugs used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica.' 
What are polymyalgia rheumatica complications?,"'Polymyalgia rheumatica can lead to loss of function of joints if untreated. This generally is temporary, but frozen shoulders can be a further medical complication. Additional complications can result from medications used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica. These include stomach bleeding or kidney impairment from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ''cataracts'', ''bruising'' of skin, and ''osteoporosis'' from cortisone medications. Therefore, the lowest possible doses of medications are best.''Polymyalgia rheumatica can occur in association with giant cell arteritis (''temporal arteritis''). Giant cell arteritis is a potentially more serious condition. It can also occur, as mentioned above, in association with a ''cancer''. The prognosis in this setting is based on the ability to cure the cancer. The polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms resolve with resolution of the cancer.'  "
What is polymyositis? What is dermatomyositis?,"'Polymyositis is a disease of muscle featuring inflammation of the muscle fibers. The cause of the disease is not known. It begins when white blood cells, the immune cells of inflammation, spontaneously invade muscles. The muscles affected are typically those closest to the trunk or torso. This results in weakness that can be severe. Polymyositis is a chronic illness featuring progressive muscle weakness with periods of increased symptoms, called flares or relapses, and minimal or no symptoms, known as remissions.''Polymyositis is slightly more common in females. It affects all age groups, although its onset is most common in middle childhood and in the 20s. Polymyositis occurs throughout the world. Polymyositis can be associated with a characteristic skin ''rash'' and is then referred to as ""dermatomyositis."" Dermatomyositis in children is referred to as juvenile dermatomyositis. ""Amyopathic dermatomyositis"" is the term used to describe people who have skin changes compatible with dermatomyositis but do not have diseased muscle involvement.''Polymyositis can also affect other areas of the body and is, therefore, referred to as a systemic illness. Occasionally, it is associated with ''cancer'' or with other diseases of connective tissue (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''). Depending on which other diseases it is associated with, it may be referred to as an ""overlap syndrome"" or ""''mixed connective tissue disease''.""' "
Polymyositis vs. polymyalgia rheumatica,"'Polymyositis is an inflammatory, destructive, autoimmune muscle disease, usually with weakness but unusually with ''pain''. ''Polymyalgia rheumatica'' is an inflammatory disease of muscle that always causes symmetrically painful muscles. ''Polymyalgia rheumatica'' is not destructive to muscles.' "
What causes polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'To date, no cause of polymyositis has been isolated by scientific researchers. There are indicators of heredity (genetic) susceptibility that can be found in some patients. There is indirect evidence of infection by a virus that has yet to be identified in a muscle disease related to polymyositis that is particularly resistant to treatment, called ''inclusion body myositis''. The pathologist, a physician specialist who interprets the microscope findings of muscle tissue, diagnoses this muscle disease. The muscle tissue in inclusion body myositis displays clear areas within the muscle cells (called vacuoles) when viewed under the magnification of a microscope.''Researchers have found that T-cells of the immune system in some polymyositis or dermatomyositis patients reacted against ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'') and that detectable antibodies against ''CMV'' were present. Their conclusion was that there may be subsets of patients who develop their disease, in part, because of infection with this particular virus.''Aside from diseases with which polymyositis can be associated (as mentioned above), many other diseases and conditions can mimic polymyositis. These include nerve-muscle diseases (such as muscular dystrophies), drug toxins (such as ''alcohol'', ''cocaine'', steroids, ''colchicine'', ''hydroxychloroquine'', and ''cholesterol''-lowering ''drugs'', called ''statins''), metabolic disorders (where muscle cells are unable to process chemicals normally), hormone disorders (such as abnormal thyroid), inclusion body myositis, calcium and magnesium conditions, and infectious diseases (such as ''influenza'' virus, ''AIDS'', ''streptococcus'' and Lyme bacteria, pork tapeworm, and ''schistosomiasis'').' "
What are signs and symptoms of polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Weakness of muscles is the most common symptom of polymyositis. The muscles involved usually are those that are closest to the trunk of the body. Both sides of the body are affected. The onset can be gradual or rapid. This results in varying degrees of loss of muscle power and atrophy. The loss of strength can be noticed as difficulty getting up from chairs, ''walking'', climbing stairs, or lifting above the shoulders. Trouble with swallowing and weakness lifting the head from the pillow can occur. Occasionally, the muscles ache and are tender to the touch.''Patients can also feel ''fatigue'', a general feeling of discomfort, and have ''weight loss'' and/or low-grade ''fever''.''Weakness of the muscles that produce the voice can lead to a weak-sounding voice (dysphonia).'""With skin involvement (dermatomyositis), the eyes can be surrounded by a violet discoloration with swelling. There can be scaly reddish discoloration over the knuckles, elbows, and knees (Gottron's sign). There can also be reddish ""'rash'' on the face, neck, and upper chest. The skin changes can occur with or prior to the development of muscle weakness. Hard lumps of calcium deposits can develop in the fatty layer of the skin, most commonly in childhood dermatomyositis.''Heart'' and lung involvement can lead to irregular heart rhythm, ''heart failure'', and inflammation of the ''lungs'' with ''shortness of breath''.''Because polymyositis can appear in combination with other illnesses (see related articles on ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''), it can also have overlap features with them. These illnesses are discussed elsewhere.''Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis can sometimes be associated with ''cancers'', including ''lymphoma'', ''breast cancer'', ''lung cancer'', ''ovarian cancer'', and ''colon cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is reported to be much greater with dermatomyositis than polymyositis.'  "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose polymyositis or dermatomyositis?,"'When a patient first sees the doctor, the recent symptoms especially concerning weakness will be discussed. The condition of many other body areas might be reviewed, for example, the skin, heart, lungs, and joints. An examination will further focus on these and other systems. Various measures of strength might be noted. The characteristic features of polymyositis include weakness of the muscles closest to the trunk of the body, abnormal elevation of muscle enzymes, electromyograph (''EMG'') findings, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') findings, and certain abnormalities detected with muscle biopsy.''Blood testing usually (but not always) reveals abnormally high levels of muscle enzymes, CPK or ''creatinine'' phosphokinase, aldolase, SGOT, SGPT, and LDH. These enzymes are released into the blood by muscle that is being damaged by inflammation. They can also be used as measures of the activity of the inflammation. Other routine blood and urine tests can also look for internal organ abnormalities. Chest ''X-rays'', mammograms, PAP smears, and other screening tests might be considered. Autoantibodies can often be found in the blood of people with polymyositis. These include antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and myositis-specific antibodies (such as Jo-1 antibody).''An electromyograph (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity are electrical tests of muscle and nerves that can show abnormal findings typical of polymyositis as well as exclude other nerve-muscle diseases.''Imaging of the muscles using radiology tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scanning), can show areas of inflammation of muscle. This sometimes can be used to determine optimal muscle biopsy sites.''A muscle biopsy is used to confirm the presence of muscle inflammation typical only of polymyositis. This is a surgical procedure whereby muscle tissue is removed for analysis by a pathologist, a specialist in examining tissue under a microscope. Muscles often used for biopsy include the ''quadriceps'' muscle of the front of the thigh, the biceps muscle of the arm, and the deltoid muscle of the shoulder.' "
What types of doctors treat polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Polymyositis is typically treated by ''rheumatologists''. Others who can be involved in the care of patients with polymyositis include internists, pathologists, dermatologists, radiologists, cardiologists, neurologists, surgeons, and physiatrists.' "
What is the treatment for polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'Initially, polymyositis is treated with high doses of ''corticosteroids''. Corticosteroids are cortisone medications (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''). These are medications related to cortisone and can be given by mouth or intravenously. They are given because they can have a powerful effect to decrease the inflammation in the muscles. They usually are required for years, and their continued use will be based on what the doctor finds related to symptoms, examination, and muscle enzyme blood test.''Corticosteroids have many predictable and unpredictable side effects. In high doses, they commonly cause an increase in appetite and weight, puffiness of the face, and ''easy bruising''. They can also cause sweats, facial-hair growth, ''upset stomach'', sensitive emotions, ''leg swelling'', ''acne'', ''cataracts'', ''osteoporosis'', ''high blood pressure'', worsening of ''diabetes'', and increased risk of infection. A rare complication of cortisone medications is severe bone damage (''avascular necrosis'') which can destroy large joints, such as the hips and shoulders. Further, abruptly stopping corticosteroids can cause flares of the disease and result in other side effects, including ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and decreased ''blood pressure''.''Corticosteroids do not always adequately improve polymyositis. In these patients, immunosuppressive medications are considered. These medications can be effective by suppressing the immune response that attracts the white blood cells of inflammation to the muscles. Many types are now commonly used and others are still experimental. ''Methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'') can be taken by mouth or by injection into the body. ''Azathioprine'' (Imuran) is an oral drug. Both can cause ''liver'' and bone-marrow side effects and require regular blood monitoring. ''Cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), and ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'') have been used for serious complications of severe disease, such as scarring of the lungs (''pulmonary fibrosis''). These also can have severe side effects which must be considered with each patient individually. Treatment with intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins (IVIG) has been shown to be effective in severe cases of polymyositis that are resistant to other treatments. Recent research reports indicate that intravenous ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') may be helpful in treating resistant disease.''Patients with calcium deposits (calcinosis) from dermatomyositis can sometimes benefit by taking ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem'') to shrink the size of the calcium deposits. This effect, however, occurs slowly (frequently over years) and is not always effective. The complication of calcium deposits in muscles and soft tissues occurs more frequently in children than adults.''Physical therapy with gradual muscle strengthening is an important part of the treatment of polymyositis. When to begin and the continued degree of ''exercise'' and range of motion of extremities is customized for each patient.''Patients can ultimately do well, especially with early medical treatment of disease and disease flares. The disease frequently becomes inactive, and rehabilitation of atrophied muscle becomes a long-term project. Monitoring for signs of ''cancer'', heart, and lung disease are essential. Accordingly, ''EKG'', lung function testing, and X-ray tests are used.''As mentioned above, the related muscle disease called inclusion body myositis is often more resistant to treatment than polymyositis. As scientists better define the specific causes of the different forms of polymyositis, treatment will be more accurately aimed at cure of this disease. Researchers are finding more specific antibodies in patients that may be used to diagnose and define active disease.'  "
What are home remedies for polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,'The best home remedy is to closely monitor the condition with the physician and physical therapist. It is best to not over-''exercise'' early on but gradually increase exercise for optimal results.' 
What is the prognosis for polymyositis?,"'The outcome for patients with polymyositis varies. While some have a relatively brief illness followed by remission not requiring subsequent treatment, others develop episodes of remissions and exacerbations requiring more or less treatment.''The presence of Jo-1 antibody, a myositis antibody, is predictive of an increased risk for the development of inflammation of the tissues of the lungs (''interstitial lung disease''). This can lead to permanent suboptimal lung function. Pulmonary function testing can be used to detect early lung abnormalities.' "
"What are risk factors for worse outcomes with polymyositis 
or dermatomyositis?","'Patients with polymyositis tend to have a higher risk for worse outcomes with older age, delay in cortisone treatment, cancer, lung or ''heart disease'', or ''difficulty swallowing''.''Cancer screening'' is performed, especially in patients with dermatomyositis, due to an increased risk of cancer in patients with muscle inflammation.' "
Is it possible to prevent polymyositis?,"'There is no ''prevention'' for polymyositis. When the precise cause of polymyositis is identified, preventative measures might be possible.' "
Are there support groups for people with polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,'Consider seeking a support group through the local branch of the ''Arthritis'' Foundation.' 
Where can people find more information on polymyositis and dermatomyositis?,"'For further information about polymyositis and dermatomyositis, please visit the following site:''Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org)''P.O.

What are colon polyps?,"'Colon polyps are growths that occur on the inner lining of the large intestine (colon) and usually protrude into the colon. Polyps form when the genetic material within the cells lining the colon changes and becomes abnormal (mutates). Normally, the immature cells lining the colon are programmed to divide (multiply), mature, and then die in a very consistent and timely fashion. However, the genetic changes that occur in the lining cells prevent the cells from maturing, and the cells do not die. This leads to an accumulation of immature, genetically abnormal cells, which eventually results in the formation of polyps. The mutations may occur as a sporadic event after birth or they may be present from before birth.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of colon polyps?,"'Ninety-five percent of colon polyps do not cause symptoms or signs, and are discovered during screening or surveillance colonoscopy.''When symptoms or signs occur, they may include:''Colon polyps are very common. They increase in prevalence as people age; by age 60, one-third or more of people will have at least one polyp. If a person has a ''colon polyp'', he or she is more likely to have additional polyps elsewhere in the colon and is more likely to form new polyps at a later time. In a small subset of patients with colon polyps, there is a familial, genetic abnormality that causes patients and other members of their families to develop larger numbers of polyps, to develop them at an early age, and to more frequently have them become cancerous.''Colon polyps are important because they may give rise to colon cancer (''colorectal cancer''). The type of polyp predicts who is more likely to develop further polyps and colon cancer. Polyps cause other problems (to be discussed), but it is the deadly nature of colon cancer that is of most concern.'""Benign polyps become malignant polyps (cancer) with further mutations and changes in the cells' genetic material (genes). The cells begin to divide and reproduce uncontrollably, sometimes giving rise to a larger polyp. Initially, the increasingly, genetically abnormal cells are limited to the layer of cells that line the inside of the colon. The cells then develop the ability to invade deeper into the wall of the colon. Individual cells also develop the ability to break off from the polyp and spread into lymph channels through the wall of the colon to the local ""'lymph nodes'' and then throughout the body, a process referred to as ''metastasis'' although this is unusual unless the cancer has invaded into the wall of the colon.''The transition from benign to malignant polyp can be seen under the microscope. In the earlier phase of the transition, called low-grade dysplasia (dysplasia=abnormal formation), the cells and their relationships to one another become abnormal. When the cells and their relationships become even more abnormal, it is termed high-grade dysplasia. High-grade dysplasia is of greater concern because the cells are clearly cancerous although they are limited to the innermost lining of the colon; with rare exceptions, they have not yet developed the abilities to invade and ''metastasize'' (spread to other parts of the body). If they are not removed, invasion and metastasis may occur.'   Red blood mixed in with or on the surface of the stool Black stools if the polyp is bleeding substantially and is located in the proximal colon (cecum and ascending colon) Iron deficiency anemia if the bleeding has been slow and occurring over a prolonged period of time. Weakness, light-headedness, fainting, pale skin, and rapid heart rate due to iron deficiency anemia The presence of invisible (occult) blood in stool that is tested when screening for colon cancer at visits to a doctor's office (Because of the tendency of polyps to bleed slowly, intermittently and in small amounts, occult blood testing of stool often is used to screen for colon cancer.) Rarely diarrhea when large villous polyps secrete fluid into the intestine Rarely constipation if the polyp is very large and obstructs the colon Rarely intussusception, a condition in which a polyp drags the portion of the colon to which it is attached into the more distal colon (i.e., telescopes into the more distal colon) and leads to obstruction of the colon. This can cause all of the signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction including abdominal pain and distention, nausea and vomiting."
What do colon polyps look like (pictures)?," Polypoid polyps look like a mushroom, but flop around inside the intestine because they are attached to the lining of the colon by a thin stalk. Sessile polyps do not have a stalk, and are attached to the lining by a broad base. Flat polyps are the least common type of colon polyp, and are flat or even slightly depressed. These may be difficult to identify because they are not as prominent as polypoid or sessile polyps with the commonly available methods of diagnosing polyps."
What are the types of colon polyps?,"'Not all colon polyps are the same. There are different histologic types, that is, the cells that make up the polyp have different characteristics when viewed under the microscope. They also vary in size, number, and location. ''Most importantly, they vary in their tendency to become cancerous (malignant).''The most common type of polyp is the adenoma or adenomatous polyp. It is an important type of polyp not only because it is the most common, but because it is the most common cause of colon cancer. The likelihood that an adenoma will develop into (or has already developed into) cancer is partially dependent on its size; the larger the polyp, the more likely it is that the polyp is or will become malignant (concern about the malignant potential increases with a polyp greater than one centimeter in size). It also matters if there is a single polyp or multiple polyps. Patients with multiple polyps -- even if they are not malignant when examined under the microscope -- are more likely to develop additional polyps in the future that may become malignant. Concern about this increasing malignant potential begins when there are three or more polyps. Finally, the malignant potential of an adenomatous polyp is related to the manner in which the cells of the polyp organize themselves as seen under the microscope. Cells that organize themselves into tubular structures (tubular adenomas) are less likely to become cancerous than cells that organize themselves into finger-like structures (villous adenomas).''Most adenomatous polyps are considered sporadic, that is, they do not stem from a recognized genetic mutation that is present at birth (are not familial). Nevertheless, the risk of having colon polyps greater than one centimeter in size or developing colon cancer is two-fold greater if a first degree relative has colon polyps greater than one centimeter in size. Therefore, there is likely to be a genetic factor working even in sporadic adenomatous polyps.'""There are several familial, genetic conditions in which the mutations or the development of mutations are programmed into an individual's genes from before birth, passed down from parent to child. In the most common of these conditions, hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps form (""'familial adenomatous polyposis'' or FAP) as a result of a mutation in the APC gene. It is important to recognize these polyposis syndromes and the exact genetic abnormality that causes them, if possible since the malignant potential of these polyps is much greater than that of individuals without the genetic abnormality. (Eighty percent or more of these patients develop colon cancer.) Even though these syndromes are responsible for only a few percent of all colon ''cancers'', recognition of a polyposis syndrome identifies patients in whom screening for additional polyps needs to be done more frequently so that new polyps and cancers can be discovered and treated early. It may even be recommended that the entire colon be removed to prevent cancer. In addition, genetic testing can be done for relatives of the patient to determine whether or not the relative has the same mutation as the patient and, therefore, is very likely to develop polyps and cancer. Relatives with the same mutation then can be screened for the presence of polyps and cancer, preferably starting the ''colorectal'' ''cancer screening'' at an earlier age than would normally be done because cancers in these syndromes develop at an earlier age than cancers not associated with a syndrome. Because of the autosomal dominant mode of transmission of the gene and its effects, only one parent needs to have the FAP gene to pass on to his or her children, and therefore, there is a 50/50 chance that each of his or her children will have FAP.''There is an uncommon form of FAP in which the number of polyps is less than classic FAP -- less than 100 -- called attenuated FAP. The mutation in the APC gene in attenuated FAP is different than the mutation in classic FAP. Patients with many polyps but not the numbers seen in FAP should be identified and tested for the mutation. Unlike FAP, which is an autosomal dominant syndrome, attenuated FAP is a recessive mutation so that an individual needs to inherit one mutated gene from each parent to develop polyps and colon cancer, and because of the rarity of the mutation, this occurs rarely.''Another syndrome of polyps and colon cancer is the MYH polyposis syndrome. Individuals with MYH polyposis develop less than 100 polyps at a young age and are at high risk for developing colon cancer. It is caused by mutations in a different gene than FAP, the MYH gene; however, the mutation occurs sporadically due to spontaneous mutations and, therefore, a hereditary pattern is not apparent in parents, although it may be seen in siblings. Because it is an autosomal recessive gene that requires a mutated gene from each parent, the MYH polyposis syndrome is rare.''The second most common type of colon polyp is the hyperplastic polyp. It is important to recognize these polyps and to differentiate them from adenomatous polyps since they have little or no potential to become cancerous unless they are located in the proximal (ascending colon), or show a particular histologic pattern under the microscope (a serrated appearance). Nevertheless, there are uncommon genetic syndromes in which patients form many hyperplastic polyps. These patients may be at a similar risk for developing colon cancer as patients with multiple adenomatous polyps, particularly if the polyps are large, serrated, located in the ascending colon, and there is a family history of colon cancer. Hyperplastic polyps may coexist with adenomatous polyps.''Much less common types of colon polyps exist, and their potential for becoming cancerous varies greatly, for example, hamartomatous, juvenile, and inflammatory polyps.'  "
Can colon polyps turn into colon cancer?,"'No, although most colon cancers arise from polyps, some do not. Some arise within the wall of the colon. These cancers may be flat or even depressed (excavated). They are more difficult to identify and treat, and they are more likely to spread into the wall of the colon and nearby lymph nodes than cancers originating in polyps. This is particularly true of serrated adenomatous polyps, which usually are flat rather than polypoid in appearance.''There also is a familial, genetic syndrome called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (''HNPCC'', Lynch syndrome) in which colon cancers occur with very high incidence (80% or more of patients). There are few or no polyps to identify in these patients. Moreover, the cancers occur at a younger age, often prior to the time screening for colon cancer is recommended to begin, and the syndrome is not recognized until a family member develops cancer usually at a young age. HNPCC is suspected because other family members also have colon cancer and certain criteria are met (Amsterdam or Bethesda criteria), or the cancer shows a particular pattern under the microscope with special stains. If HNPCC is suspected, genetic testing on the cancer can be done to identify the hereditary mutation, and other family members can be tested for the same mutation. If present, the family members can undergo a screening colonoscopy and follow-up surveillance colonoscopies. HNPCC may be associated with cancers in tissues outside the colon as well. Fortunately, HNPCC is responsible for only a few percent of all colon cancers.' "
Are the size of colon polyps related to the risk of colon cancer?,'Colon polyps can vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. The larger the polyp the more likely it is that there will be cancer within the polyp or that the polyp will later become cancerous.' 
What procedures and tests diagnose colon polyps?,"'There are several means to diagnose colon polyps.''Endoscopic colonoscopy involves the use of a ''colonoscope'', a flexible tube approximately five ''feet'"" in length with a light and camera at the end and a hollow channel through which instruments can be passed. The colonoscope is passed via the anus into the colon and then through the colon until the proximal end of the colon -- the cecum -- is reached. On withdrawal of the colonoscope, the lining of the colon is observed for polyps and other abnormalities. These may be biopsied or removed using electrocautery and then examined under the microscope. Colonoscopy identifies 95% of polyps, small and large, though occasionally polyps are missed if they are small, hidden by folds in the colon's lining, are flat, or the colonoscopy is hurried.""'Virtual colonoscopy involves the use of either ''computerized tomography'' (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''). The colon is filled with either a liquid contrast agent or air, and CT or MRI is performed. Computerized reconstruction of either the CT or MRI images provides a virtual image that mimics the view obtained by a colonoscope. Virtual colonoscopy is very good at finding polyps but not as good as colonoscopy; it can miss polyps less than one centimeter in size, although the need to identify these smaller polyps is debated since they infrequently are malignant. MRI has an advantage over CT because it does not expose the patient to ''radiation''. It is more expensive, however, and there is less experience with MRI than with CT. The problem with both CT and MRI virtual colonoscopy is that if a polyp is found that should be removed, colonoscopy then must be done at a later time to remove it.''Barium enema is an older method of diagnosing colon polyps. During a barium enema, the colon is filled with barium, and multiple ''X-rays'' of the colon are taken as the patient changes position. Barium enema is a good way to diagnose polyps and is relatively inexpensive; however, it can easily miss small polyps and exposes patients to radiation. Moreover, the skills and experience necessary to do a barium enema properly have declined among radiologists because barium enemas are less frequently ordered now that colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy are available. Finally, like virtual colonoscopy, if polyps are found, a colonoscopy must be done to remove the polyp.''Flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'' uses a shortened version of a colonoscope, approximately three feet in length. It is able to examine only the distal third to one-half of the colon. Like the colonoscope, it can be used to identify, biopsy, and remove polyps without exposure to radiation. For screening purposes, since the sigmoidoscope cannot examine the entire colon, it usually is combined with either less frequent colonoscopy or frequent stool occult blood tests to identify polyps beyond its reach.'  "
Should you get a second opinion after being diagnosed with colon polyps or cancer?,"""Several expert groups have made recommendations for surveillance in individuals who have been found to have polyps on their initial examination, which usually is endoscopic colonoscopy but occasionally virtual colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. The recommendations vary slightly from group to group but not in important ways. They all make recommendations on the basis of factors such as family history of polyps and colon cancer, the number of polyps that are found, the size of the polyps, and the polyps' histology. By using these factors, the interval between surveillance procedures can be tailored to the risk of developing further polyps and ""'malignancy'' in the future -- the higher the risk, the shorter the interval between surveillance procedures. The recommendations that follow are modified from the guidelines proposed by the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer published in 2012.''Adenomas can be classified as low risk (LRA) and high risk (HRA) for cancer.''LRA is defined'' as one to two tubular adenomas less than one centimeter in size.''HRA is defined'' as three or more adenomas, with one tubular adenoma greater than one centimeter in size, or an adenoma with villous histology or high-grade dysplasia.''Recommendations regarding when to have the third and subsequent examinations depend on the presence of LRA or HRA on the first and second examinations and can vary between three and 10 years.' If no polyps are found on the first examination it is recommended that a second examination should be done 10 years later. If the only polyps that are found are hyperplastic polyps, and they are limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon and they are all less than one centimeter in size, a second examination is recommended in 10 years. If one or two tubular adenomas are found and they are less than one centimeter in size, a second examination is recommended in five years though a longer interval may be reasonable as well. If three to ten adenomas are found, it is recommended that a second examination be done in three years. If more than ten adenomas are found, it is recommended that a second examination be done in three years or less. If one or more tubular adenomas are found that are greater than one centimeter in size, a second examination is recommended in three years. If one or more adenomas are found of any size and their histology is villous, a second examination is recommended in three years. If one or more adenomas are found and any show high grade dysplasia, a second examination is recommended in three years. If serrated polyps are found, recommendations are less secure because much less information is available about the future risk of polyps and cancers. Concerns are greater (and the interval to the next examination should be shorter) if the polyps are proximal (in the ascending colon), are larger (more than one centimeter in size), and particularly if they show dysplasia."
What is the treatment for colon polyps?,"'Most polyps can be removed through the endoscope. They are then examined under the microscope. It is important to determine whether or not they contain cancer, if they are of a type that has malignant potential, and if they have characteristics that make them more likely to be associated with cancer, either in another polyp at the same time or in polyps that may form in the future (for example, are villous or serrated).''The results of the colonoscopy and histologic examination are important because they determine the need for increased frequency of screening colonoscopy in the future (for example, adenomatous polyps). If there is cancer already present in the polyp it is important to determine how deep into the wall of the colon the cancer has spread. If it extends deeply, it is more likely that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes further away. If there is deep extension of the cancer, it may be necessary to do additional endoscopic resection of the area of colon where the polyp was or to surgically remove the section of colon, in order to be certain that all of the cancer has been removed. Nearby lymph nodes also may be removed and examined to identify any spread of the cancer beyond the colon.''If a genetic mutation is suspected, it is looked for by genetic testing on a portion of the biopsy, and, if present, relatives should be screened for the same mutation. If present, the relatives should undergo screening colonoscopy and more frequent surveillance colonoscopy.''It is recommended that patients with FAP and other polyp syndromes consider having their colons removed prophylactically to prevent the development of cancer.'  "
How is genetic testing used in people with colon polyps and colon cancer?,"'Genetics and genetic testing have become an important aspect in the evaluation of both colon polyps and colon cancer.''Every patient with a colon polyp should have a careful family history taken. If necessary, individuals or families can be referred to doctors who specialize in the genetics of diseases who can help with decisions about genetic testing and screening. This is especially important in patients with multiple polyps, several family members with polyps or colon cancer, or a family member with early onset of colon cancer (before age 50).''A family history of colon polyps and colon cancer is an important clue to the possible presence of a familial, genetic syndrome. If a syndrome is suspected, individuals can be tested for known mutations, and they can begin surveillance colonoscopies starting at an earlier age; however, there are still syndromes for which mutations are unknown and for which cannot be tested. Nevertheless, even in these latter families, there is a benefit; family members are made aware of the possibility of an unidentifiable syndrome and may begin surveillance colonoscopies early. Patients with FAP often have other polyps with malignant potential in the gastrointestinal tract and develop polyps and/or cancers in other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal tissues. They require further screening to determine if the non-colonic polyps have malignant potential and if cancer has developed outside of the gastrointestinal tract.''Genetics also may be used in other ways. In families with FAP or HNPCC, if the genetic abnormality is identified in the initial family member with polyps or cancer, other family members can be identified with the same abnormality and who then can begin early ''colon cancer screening''.' "
Can colon polyps be prevented?,"'Because of concern regarding the transition of polyps to cancer, attempts have been made to determine if treatments with theoretical potential actually prevent polyps. The problem with most studies is that they are retrospective, observational studies which are not sufficient as proof. The long period of time (many years) that it takes for polyps to form makes long-term studies mandatory, but such studies have been difficult to do except in the case of familial, genetic polyposis syndromes, and, because of the differences in their causes, it is not clear if what applies to them applies to the more common sporadic adenomas.''Several associations have been explored for antioxidants including selenium, beta carotene, and ''vitamins'' A, C, and E. Most of the studies that have been done do not support a role for these agents in preventing polyps or in preventing colon cancer. A limited amount of support is available for the use of selenium to prevent polyps, but selenium is not recommended for use outside of experimental trials.''Supplemental dietary calcium has been demonstrated in one study to prevent the formation of polyps. The benefit was seen with supplementation of 1200 mg of calcium per day. There is some concern about using calcium since higher dietary and supplemental levels are associated with an increase in ''vascular disease''. The intake of calcium that was studied was higher than the recommended intake of calcium, 800 mg per day.''The best support for a treatment to prevent polyps is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), a class of drugs that includes ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), ''celecoxib'' (''Celebrex''), and many others. Aspirin has been shown in several studies to reduce the formation of polyps by 30% to 50%. The effect is likely to occur with higher doses of aspirin (more than the 81-325 mg that is recommended for ''cardiovascular disease'' ''prevention'""), and there is concern about aspirin's side effect of gastrointestinal bleeding at these doses.""'Celecoxib (Celebrex), a ""''COX-2'' selective ''NSAID''"" or ''Cox-2 inhibitor'' has been shown to reduce colon polyps 30% to 50% as well, but there is a lingering concern about the possible cardiovascular side effects that may be seen with most NSAIDs (though the data supporting this side effect is conflicting). It may be used in patients with genetic polyposis syndromes who choose not to have their colons removed. Celecoxib might be considered in patients with a low risk for cardiovascular disease who develop adenomatous polyps frequently.''Sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), a ""non-selective NSAID"" has been shown to prevent polyps in patients with sporadic adenoma as well as the genetic syndromes. As with celecoxib, there is concern about cardiovascular side effects and gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding.''Given the information that is available, it is not recommended that patients at average risk for the formation of additional polyps be treated for prevention because of concern that the risks of treatment, primarily intestinal bleeding and cardiovascular disease, may outweigh the benefit of polyp prevention. It may be reasonable to treat patients who are at higher than average risk for polyps in which the benefit may outweigh the risks. Such patients might include those with frequent polyp formation, particularly those who have demonstrated cancerous changes in the polyps, or patients who already have had colon cancer. Studies in these types of patients are eagerly awaited.' "
What are colon polyps?,"'Colon polyps are growths that occur on the inner lining of the large intestine (colon) and usually protrude into the colon. Polyps form when the genetic material within the cells lining the colon changes and becomes abnormal (mutates). Normally, the immature cells lining the colon are programmed to divide (multiply), mature, and then die in a very consistent and timely fashion. However, the genetic changes that occur in the lining cells prevent the cells from maturing, and the cells do not die. This leads to an accumulation of immature, genetically abnormal cells, which eventually results in the formation of polyps. The mutations may occur as a sporadic event after birth or they may be present from before birth.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of colon polyps?,"'Ninety-five percent of colon polyps do not cause symptoms or signs, and are discovered during screening or surveillance colonoscopy.''When symptoms or signs occur, they may include:''Colon polyps are very common. They increase in prevalence as people age; by age 60, one-third or more of people will have at least one polyp. If a person has a ''colon polyp'', he or she is more likely to have additional polyps elsewhere in the colon and is more likely to form new polyps at a later time. In a small subset of patients with colon polyps, there is a familial, genetic abnormality that causes patients and other members of their families to develop larger numbers of polyps, to develop them at an early age, and to more frequently have them become cancerous.''Colon polyps are important because they may give rise to colon cancer (''colorectal cancer''). The type of polyp predicts who is more likely to develop further polyps and colon cancer. Polyps cause other problems (to be discussed), but it is the deadly nature of colon cancer that is of most concern.'""Benign polyps become malignant polyps (cancer) with further mutations and changes in the cells' genetic material (genes). The cells begin to divide and reproduce uncontrollably, sometimes giving rise to a larger polyp. Initially, the increasingly, genetically abnormal cells are limited to the layer of cells that line the inside of the colon. The cells then develop the ability to invade deeper into the wall of the colon. Individual cells also develop the ability to break off from the polyp and spread into lymph channels through the wall of the colon to the local ""'lymph nodes'' and then throughout the body, a process referred to as ''metastasis'' although this is unusual unless the cancer has invaded into the wall of the colon.''The transition from benign to malignant polyp can be seen under the microscope. In the earlier phase of the transition, called low-grade dysplasia (dysplasia=abnormal formation), the cells and their relationships to one another become abnormal. When the cells and their relationships become even more abnormal, it is termed high-grade dysplasia. High-grade dysplasia is of greater concern because the cells are clearly cancerous although they are limited to the innermost lining of the colon; with rare exceptions, they have not yet developed the abilities to invade and ''metastasize'' (spread to other parts of the body). If they are not removed, invasion and metastasis may occur.'   Red blood mixed in with or on the surface of the stool Black stools if the polyp is bleeding substantially and is located in the proximal colon (cecum and ascending colon) Iron deficiency anemia if the bleeding has been slow and occurring over a prolonged period of time. Weakness, light-headedness, fainting, pale skin, and rapid heart rate due to iron deficiency anemia The presence of invisible (occult) blood in stool that is tested when screening for colon cancer at visits to a doctor's office (Because of the tendency of polyps to bleed slowly, intermittently and in small amounts, occult blood testing of stool often is used to screen for colon cancer.) Rarely diarrhea when large villous polyps secrete fluid into the intestine Rarely constipation if the polyp is very large and obstructs the colon Rarely intussusception, a condition in which a polyp drags the portion of the colon to which it is attached into the more distal colon (i.e., telescopes into the more distal colon) and leads to obstruction of the colon. This can cause all of the signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction including abdominal pain and distention, nausea and vomiting."
What do colon polyps look like (pictures)?," Polypoid polyps look like a mushroom, but flop around inside the intestine because they are attached to the lining of the colon by a thin stalk. Sessile polyps do not have a stalk, and are attached to the lining by a broad base. Flat polyps are the least common type of colon polyp, and are flat or even slightly depressed. These may be difficult to identify because they are not as prominent as polypoid or sessile polyps with the commonly available methods of diagnosing polyps."
What are the types of colon polyps?,"'Not all colon polyps are the same. There are different histologic types, that is, the cells that make up the polyp have different characteristics when viewed under the microscope. They also vary in size, number, and location. ''Most importantly, they vary in their tendency to become cancerous (malignant).''The most common type of polyp is the adenoma or adenomatous polyp. It is an important type of polyp not only because it is the most common, but because it is the most common cause of colon cancer.

What is the treatment for colon polyps?,"'Most polyps can be removed through the endoscope. They are then examined under the microscope. It is important to determine whether or not they contain cancer, if they are of a type that has malignant potential, and if they have characteristics that make them more likely to be associated with cancer, either in another polyp at the same time or in polyps that may form in the future (for example, are villous or serrated).''The results of the colonoscopy and histologic examination are important because they determine the need for increased frequency of screening colonoscopy in the future (for example, adenomatous polyps). If there is cancer already present in the polyp it is important to determine how deep into the wall of the colon the cancer has spread. If it extends deeply, it is more likely that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes further away. If there is deep extension of the cancer, it may be necessary to do additional endoscopic resection of the area of colon where the polyp was or to surgically remove the section of colon, in order to be certain that all of the cancer has been removed. Nearby lymph nodes also may be removed and examined to identify any spread of the cancer beyond the colon.''If a genetic mutation is suspected, it is looked for by genetic testing on a portion of the biopsy, and, if present, relatives should be screened for the same mutation. If present, the relatives should undergo screening colonoscopy and more frequent surveillance colonoscopy.''It is recommended that patients with FAP and other polyp syndromes consider having their colons removed prophylactically to prevent the development of cancer.'  "
How is genetic testing used in people with colon polyps and colon cancer?,"'Genetics and genetic testing have become an important aspect in the evaluation of both colon polyps and colon cancer.''Every patient with a colon polyp should have a careful family history taken. If necessary, individuals or families can be referred to doctors who specialize in the genetics of diseases who can help with decisions about genetic testing and screening. This is especially important in patients with multiple polyps, several family members with polyps or colon cancer, or a family member with early onset of colon cancer (before age 50).''A family history of colon polyps and colon cancer is an important clue to the possible presence of a familial, genetic syndrome. If a syndrome is suspected, individuals can be tested for known mutations, and they can begin surveillance colonoscopies starting at an earlier age; however, there are still syndromes for which mutations are unknown and for which cannot be tested. Nevertheless, even in these latter families, there is a benefit; family members are made aware of the possibility of an unidentifiable syndrome and may begin surveillance colonoscopies early. Patients with FAP often have other polyps with malignant potential in the gastrointestinal tract and develop polyps and/or cancers in other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal tissues. They require further screening to determine if the non-colonic polyps have malignant potential and if cancer has developed outside of the gastrointestinal tract.''Genetics also may be used in other ways. In families with FAP or HNPCC, if the genetic abnormality is identified in the initial family member with polyps or cancer, other family members can be identified with the same abnormality and who then can begin early ''colon cancer screening''.' "
Can colon polyps be prevented?,"'Because of concern regarding the transition of polyps to cancer, attempts have been made to determine if treatments with theoretical potential actually prevent polyps. The problem with most studies is that they are retrospective, observational studies which are not sufficient as proof. The long period of time (many years) that it takes for polyps to form makes long-term studies mandatory, but such studies have been difficult to do except in the case of familial, genetic polyposis syndromes, and, because of the differences in their causes, it is not clear if what applies to them applies to the more common sporadic adenomas.''Several associations have been explored for antioxidants including selenium, beta carotene, and ''vitamins'' A, C, and E. Most of the studies that have been done do not support a role for these agents in preventing polyps or in preventing colon cancer. A limited amount of support is available for the use of selenium to prevent polyps, but selenium is not recommended for use outside of experimental trials.''Supplemental dietary calcium has been demonstrated in one study to prevent the formation of polyps. The benefit was seen with supplementation of 1200 mg of calcium per day. There is some concern about using calcium since higher dietary and supplemental levels are associated with an increase in ''vascular disease''. The intake of calcium that was studied was higher than the recommended intake of calcium, 800 mg per day.''The best support for a treatment to prevent polyps is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), a class of drugs that includes ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), ''celecoxib'' (''Celebrex''), and many others. Aspirin has been shown in several studies to reduce the formation of polyps by 30% to 50%. The effect is likely to occur with higher doses of aspirin (more than the 81-325 mg that is recommended for ''cardiovascular disease'' ''prevention'""), and there is concern about aspirin's side effect of gastrointestinal bleeding at these doses.""'Celecoxib (Celebrex), a ""''COX-2'' selective ''NSAID''"" or ''Cox-2 inhibitor'' has been shown to reduce colon polyps 30% to 50% as well, but there is a lingering concern about the possible cardiovascular side effects that may be seen with most NSAIDs (though the data supporting this side effect is conflicting). It may be used in patients with genetic polyposis syndromes who choose not to have their colons removed. Celecoxib might be considered in patients with a low risk for cardiovascular disease who develop adenomatous polyps frequently.''Sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), a ""non-selective NSAID"" has been shown to prevent polyps in patients with sporadic adenoma as well as the genetic syndromes. As with celecoxib, there is concern about cardiovascular side effects and gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding.''Given the information that is available, it is not recommended that patients at average risk for the formation of additional polyps be treated for prevention because of concern that the risks of treatment, primarily intestinal bleeding and cardiovascular disease, may outweigh the benefit of polyp prevention. It may be reasonable to treat patients who are at higher than average risk for polyps in which the benefit may outweigh the risks. Such patients might include those with frequent polyp formation, particularly those who have demonstrated cancerous changes in the polyps, or patients who already have had colon cancer. Studies in these types of patients are eagerly awaited.' "
What are uterine fibroids? What do they look like?,"'Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that originate in the uterus (womb). Although they are composed of the same smooth muscle fibers as the uterine wall (myometrium), they are much denser than normal myometrium. Uterine fibroids are usually round. In most cases, fibroids do not cause ''pain'' or other symptoms. However, exceptionally large fibroids may cause pressure on the bladder or other organs, leading to specific symptoms (see: What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids?)''Uterine fibroids are often described based upon their location within the uterus.'   Subserosal fibroids are located beneath the serosa (the lining membrane on the outside of the uterus). These often appear localized on the outside surface of the uterus or may be attached to the outside surface by a pedicle. Submucosal (submucous) fibroids are located inside the uterine cavity beneath the inner lining of the uterus. Intramural fibroids are located within the muscular wall of the uterus. Pedunculated fibroids grow on a stalk of tissue known as a pedicle (like a mushroom), extending either inside the cavity of the uterus or outside the uterus from its outer surface."
What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Do they cause pain?,"'Most of the time, uterine fibroids do not cause symptoms or problems, and a woman with a ''fibroid'' is usually unaware of its presence.''However, abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common symptom of a ''fibroid''. If the tumors are near the uterine lining, or interfere with the blood flow to the lining, they can cause heavy periods, painful periods, prolonged periods, or ''spotting'' between menses. Women with excessive bleeding due to fibroids may develop ''iron deficiency anemia''. Uterine fibroids that are degenerating can sometimes cause severe, localized pain.''Fibroids can also cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. Large fibroids can cause:''While fibroids do not interfere with ''ovulation'', some studies suggest that they may impair ''fertility'' and lead to poorer ''pregnancy'' outcomes. In particular, submucosal fibroids that deform the inner uterine cavity are most strongly associated with decreases in fertility. Occasionally, fibroids are the cause of recurrent miscarriages. If they are not removed in these cases, the woman may not be able to sustain a pregnancy.'   pressure, pelvic pain, including pain during sex, pressure on the bladder with frequent or even obstructed urination, and pressure on the rectum with painful or difficult defecation."
What causes uterine fibroids to grow? How big can they get?,"'We do not know exactly why women develop these tumors. Genetic abnormalities, alterations in growth factor (proteins formed in the body that direct the rate and extent of cell proliferation) expression, abnormalities in the vascular (blood vessel) system, and tissue response to injury have all been suggested to play a role in the development of fibroids.''Family history is a key factor, since there is often a history of fibroids developing in women of the same family. Race also appears to play a role. Women of African descent are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than women of other races. Women of African ancestry also develop fibroids at a younger age and may have symptoms from fibroids in their 20s, in contrast to Caucasian women with fibroids, in whom symptoms typically occur during the 30s and 40s. Early pregnancy decreases the likelihood that fibroids will develop. Fibroids have not been observed in girls who have not reached ''puberty'', but adolescent girls may rarely develop fibroids. Other factors that researchers have associated with an increased risk of developing fibroids include having the first ''menstrual period'' (menarche) prior to age 10, consumption of ''alcohol'' (particularly beer), uterine infections, and elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''Estrogen tends to stimulate the growth of fibroids in many cases. During the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy, about a third of fibroids will enlarge and then shrink after the birth. In general, fibroids tend to shrink after ''menopause'', but ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'' may cause symptoms to persist.''Overall, these tumors are fairly common and occur in about 70% to 80% of all women by the time they reach age 50.''Uterine fibroids can be as small as a few millimeters (less than an inch) in diameter. They can also be very large (grapefruit-sized or larger).' "
Can uterine fibroids cause cancer?,"'For the most part, uterine fibroids that do not cause a problem for the woman can be left untreated. In some cases, even fibroids that are not causing symptoms require removal or at least close observation. Rapid growth is a reason to watch more carefully, since a rare cancerous form of fibroid (referred to as a leiomyosarcoma) can be a fast-growing ''tumor'', and it cannot be differentiated from a benign fibroid by ultrasound, MRI , or other imaging studies. However, this type of tumor occurs in less than 1% of uterine fibroids. It is also important to note that these rare cancerous tumors are not thought to begin in a benign fibroid.''Another risk of leaving these tumors alone is that they sometimes grow to a size that eventually causes significant symptoms, thus requiring removal. If fibroids grow large enough, the surgery to remove them can become more difficult and risky.' "
What tests diagnose uterine fibroids?,"'Uterine fibroids are diagnosed by pelvic exam and even more commonly by ultrasound. Often, a pelvic mass cannot be determined to be a fibroid on pelvic exam alone, and ultrasound is very helpful in differentiating it from other conditions such as ovarian tumors. MRI and ''CT scans'' can also play a role in diagnosing fibroids, but ultrasound is the simplest, cheapest, and best technique for imaging the pelvis. Occasionally, when trying to determine if a fibroid is present in the uterine cavity (endometrial cavity), a hysterosonogram (HSG) is done. In this procedure, an ultrasound exam is done while contrast fluid is injected into the uterus through the cervix. The fluid within the endometrial cavity can help outline any masses that are inside, such as submucosal fibroids.'  "
Are there home remedies for uterine fibroids?,"'There are no known home remedies that can shrink fibroids. If uterine fibroids are not causing symptoms or problems, they can be left alone without specific treatment. If they are large enough to cause symptoms like bleeding, pain, or pressure, medical or surgical treatment is required.' "
What is the treatment for uterine fibroids?,"'There are several uterine fibroids treatment options, including:''Medical treatments include medications such as:'   surgery (hysterectomy, myomectomy, cryosurgery), MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and uterine artery embolization (UAE). mifepristone (RU-486), danazol (Danocrine), raloxifene (Evista), GnRH analogs (Lupron and others), and low-dose formulations of oral contraceptives."
Surgery for fibroids,"'There are many ways of managing uterine fibroids. Surgical methods are the mainstay of treatment when treatment is necessary. Possible surgical interventions include hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus (and the fibroids with it). ''Myomectomy'' is the selective removal of just the fibroids within the uterus. Myomectomy can be done through a hysteroscope, laparoscope, or with the standard open incision on the abdominal wall. Some treatments have involved boring holes into the fibroid with laser fibers, freezing probes (cryosurgery), and other destructive techniques that do not actually remove the tissue but try to destroy it in place. Surgery is necessary if there is suspicion of ''malignancy'' in any case of a leiomyoma or uterine mass.''Another technique for treating fibroids is known as uterine artery embolization (UAE). This technique uses small beads of a compound called polyvinyl alcohol, which are injected through a catheter into the arteries that feed the fibroid. These beads obstruct the blood supply to the fibroid and starve it of blood and oxygen. While this technique has not been in use long enough to evaluate long-term effects of UAE versus surgery, women undergoing UAE for fibroids have a shorter hospital stay than those having surgery but a greater risk of complications and readmissions to the hospital. Studies are underway to evaluate the long-term outcomes of UAE as opposed to surgical treatment. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO), which involves clamping the involved uterine arteries as opposed to injecting the polyvinyl alcohol beads, is currently under investigation as a potential alternative to UAE.''High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a relatively new treatment for fibroids and other abnormalities. It is also known as MRgFUS (MRI-guided focused ultrasound) and FUS (focused ultrasound surgery). HIFU uses an ultrasound transducer with higher energy than those used for diagnostic examinations. The device focuses the sound waves, generating heat to destroy the fibroid. MRI imaging may be used for planning and monitoring of treatment.'  "
Medical treatment for fibroids,"'Nonsurgical techniques are usually hormonal in nature and include the use of ''drugs'' that turn off the production of estrogen from the ovaries (GnRH analogs). These medications are given for three to six months and induce a hypoestrogenic (low estrogen) state. When successful, they can shrink the fibroids by as much as 50%. Side effects of these drugs are similar to the ''symptoms of menopause'' and can include ''hot flashes'', ''sleep'' disturbance, ''vaginal dryness'', and ''mood changes''. Bone loss leading to ''osteoporosis'' after long-term (6 to 12+ months) use is one complication. This is generally reversed after the treatment ends. These drugs may also be used as preoperative treatment for large leiomyomas to shrink them in order to make the operation less difficult and reduce surgical risk.''Mifepristone (RU-486) is an antiprogestin drug that can shrink fibroids to an extent comparable to treatment with the GnRH analogs. This drug is also used to terminate early pregnancy. Treatment with mifepristone also reduces the bleeding associated with fibroids, but this treatment can be associated with adverse side effects such as overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the ''endometrium'' (uterine lining). Mifepristone is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, and the required dosages (different from those used for termination of early pregnancy) have not been determined.''Danazol (Danocrine) is an androgenic steroid hormone that has been used to reduce bleeding in women with fibroids, since this drug causes ''menstruation'' to cease. However, danazol does not appear to shrink the size of fibroids. Danazol is also associated with significant side effects, including ''weight gain'', ''muscle cramps'', decreased breast size, ''acne'', hirsutism (inappropriate hair growth), oily skin, mood changes, ''depression'', decreased high density lipoprotein (''HDL'' or ""good"" ''cholesterol'') levels, and increased ''liver'' enzyme levels.''The administration of raloxifene (Evista), a drug used to prevent and treat ''osteoporosis'' in postmenopausal women, has been shown to decrease the size of fibroids in postmenopausal women, but results with this therapy in premenopausal women have been conflicting.''Low dose formulations of oral contraceptives are also sometimes given to treat the abnormal bleeding associated with fibroids, but these do not shrink the fibroids themselves.' "
What are the risks of uterine fibroids during pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown an increased risk of pregnancy complications in the presence of fibroids, such as first trimester bleeding, breech presentation, ''placental abruption'', and problems during ''labor''. Fibroids have also been associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. The size of the fibroid and its precise location within the uterus are important factors in determining whether a fibroid causes obstetric complications.' "
What is popcorn lung (bronchiolitis obliterans)?,"'Popcorn lung is a serious and irreversible condition in which the tiny air sacs in the ''lungs'' become scarred and constricted, which results in no air movement or O2 - CO2 exchange in the ''lungs''.''Other names for popcorn lung are ''bronchiolitis'' obliterans and obliterative ''bronchiolitis''.'  "
Can e-cigarettes cause popcorn lung?,"'It appears ''e-cigarettes'' and vaping devices (often called\xa0vapes) may potentially cause popcorn lung or a similar condition. Canadian researchers reported a\xa0 single 2019 case of a lung injury fitting the popcorn lung profile linked to ''marijuana'' and ''nicotine'' vapes. This report came on the heels of a spate of dozens of U.S. injuries and deaths linked to ''vitamin E'' acetate in marijuana-based and nicotine-based vape fluid. The outbreak, dubbed vaping lung disease, fit the profile of\xa0a different kind of condition\xa0than the Canadian case,\xa0one with different kinds of lung damage than seen in popcorn lung.''A study published in 2015 in the ''Journal Environmental Health Perspectives'' showed that harmful chemicals associated with ""popcorn lung"" are present in many types of flavored ''e-cigarettes'', particularly those with flavors like fruit and candy that may appeal to young ''smokers''. Of the 51 flavored e-cigarettes tested, flavoring chemicals were found in 47 and diacetyl specifically in 39 samples. This suggests a potentially dangerous level of exposure via e-cigarettes to chemicals that can cause severe lung damage.' "
What causes popcorn lung?,"'In 2004, The US Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) reported several cases of bronchiolitis obliterans in workers in a microwave popcorn plant in Missouri in 2000. After investigation by the NIOSH (National Institute of Occupation Safety and Health), it was discovered that a flavoring agent termed diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) was used to give the popcorn a buttery taste. Inhaling this chemical flavoring likely contributed to the development of this lung disease.''Popcorn lung (bronchiolitis obliterans) often is associated with symptoms of ''cough'' and ''shortness of breath'', similar to that seen in people with ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). This process is irreversible with currently available therapy.''More recently, a legal case was settled in Colorado for over 7 million dollars. The award was granted to a consumer who developed bronchiolitis obliterans (""popcorn lung"") after eating two ''bags'' of microwaved popcorn every day for 10 years. Since workers who manufacture microwaved popcorn were at risk, the judgment stated that the popcorn manufacturers and the supermarket corporations should have realized that consumers could also be at risk of this lung disease.''Another chemical similar to diacetyl called 2,3-pentanedione also is suspected as a cause of the disease. Both diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione are released into the air during grinding and packaging of coffee beans. These two chemicals are members of the chemical class alpha-diketones. Other members of this chemical class may cause similar lung damage according to the CDC, but they have not yet been studied.''Other causes of popcorn lung may be due to some of the following chemicals when inhaled.'  Acetaldehyde Formaldehyde Sulfur dioxide Nitrogen oxides Chlorine Hydrochloric acid Ammonia Metal oxides (formed during welding) Mustard gas (chemical weapon)"
What are the symptoms of popcorn lung?,"'The symptoms of ""popcorn lung"" are primarily ''cough'' and ''shortness of breath''. These symptoms can develop slowly and subtly, gradually progressing to more disabling symptoms over time. Other symptoms of popcorn lung include:''Severe exposure of these chemicals as seen in people who work at microwave popcorn plants may include inflammation of the skin and mucosal surfaces (eyes, nose, and/or throat). In general, however, because the symptoms are so similar to tobacco-related ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') as well as ''asthma'', the diagnosis may be difficult to make without a high level of suspicion.'  Fevers Cough (may be chronic) Shortness of breath (especially with exercise) Night sweats Weight loss"
How is popcorn lung diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans lung begins by taking a thorough history, and additional testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. Lung function testing (''spirometry''), chest ''X-rays'', and ''CT scans'' usually are done to help determine a preliminary diagnosis. Lung tissue biopsy, which often requires an open lung surgical procedure, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. The disease can be randomly located in lung tissue, making it difficult at times for the pathologist to make an accurate diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for popcorn lung?,"'The primary treatment of popcorn lung is removal of any exposure to the diacetyl agent. Special facial coverings and a respirator masks are required for workers exposed to this chemical. In some cases, the person must be removed from diacetyl exposure and the environment.''For consumers, avoiding exposure to diacetyl is essential. In some people, this will result in a gradual decrease in symptoms if the process was diagnosed early enough. Steroids, antibiotics, and oxygen may be used to treat symptoms. In others, however, the disease can progress and may even require lung transplantation.' "
What is the life expectancy for popcorn lung? Is it fatal?,"'According to the CDC, most individuals show little or no response to medical treatments for popcorn lung. However, if a person is diagnosed early and exposure to the chemicals are stopped, he or she may note a decrease or discontinuation of symptoms such ''chronic cough''.' "
What is a Baker's cyst?,"""A Baker's ""'cyst'"" is swelling caused by fluid from the knee joint protruding to the back of the knee. The back of the knee is also referred to as the popliteal area of the knee. A Baker's cyst is sometimes referred to as a popliteal cyst or ""'Baker cyst''.'""When an excess of knee joint fluid (synovitis) is compressed by the body weight between the bones of the knee joint, it can become trapped and separate from the joint to form the fluid-filled sac of a Baker's cyst. The name of the cyst is in memory of the physician who originally described the condition, the British surgeon William Morrant Baker (1839-1896).""  "
What causes a Baker's cyst?,"""Baker's cysts are not uncommon and can be caused by virtually any cause of joint swelling (arthritis). The excess joint fluid (synovial fluid) bulges to the back of the knee to form the Baker's cyst. The most common type of arthritis associated with Baker's cysts is ""'osteoarthritis'', also called ''degenerative arthritis'"". Baker's cysts can occur in children with juvenile arthritis of the knee. Baker's cysts also can result from cartilage tears (such as a ""'torn meniscus''), ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and other knee problems.' "
What are risk factors for a Baker's cyst?,"""Risk factors for a Baker's cyst include a ""'torn meniscus'', knee arthritis (including ''osteoarthritis'' and ''rheumatoid arthritis''), and knee joint injury.' "
What are symptoms and signs of a Baker's cyst?,"""A Baker's cyst may cause no symptoms or be associated with ""'knee pain'' and/or tightness, and ''stiffness'"" behind the knee, especially when the knee is extended or fully flexed. Baker's cysts are usually visible as a bulge behind the knee that is particularly noticeable on standing and when compared to the opposite uninvolved knee. They are generally soft and minimally tender. Sometimes there can be a mild decrease in the range of motion of the knee.""""Baker's cysts can become complicated by spread of fluid down the leg between the muscles of the calf (dissection). The cyst can rupture, leaking fluid down the inner leg to sometimes cause the appearance of a painless bruise under the inner ankle. Baker's cyst dissection and rupture are frequently associated with swelling of the leg and can mimic ""'phlebitis'"" of the leg. A ruptured Baker's cyst typically causes rapid-onset swelling of the leg with ""'bruising'' around the ankle.'  "
What types of doctors treat a Baker's cyst?,"""Doctors who treat Baker's cysts include general primary care physicians, orthopedists, and ""'rheumatologists''.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose a Baker's cyst?,"""Baker's cysts can be diagnosed by the doctor's examination and confirmed by imaging tests (either ""'ultrasound'', injection of contrast dye into the knee followed by imaging, called an arthrogram, or ''MRI'' scan) if necessary. Health care professionals can rule out other causes of swelling behind the knee (including ''deep vein thrombosis'', popliteal ''aneurysm'', and neuroma) using these imaging tests.' "
What is the treatment for a Baker's cyst?,"""Baker's cysts often resolve with aspiration (removal) of excess knee fluid in conjunction with cortisone injection. Medications are sometimes given to relieve ""'pain'' and inflammation, including ''over-the-counter'' anti-inflammatory ''drugs''.''When cartilage tears or other internal knee problems are associated, physical therapy or surgery can be the best treatment option. During a surgical operation (typically by ''arthroscopy'' using an arthroscope), the surgeon can remove the swollen tissue (synovium) that leads to the cyst formation. This is most commonly done with arthroscopic surgery. Physical therapy is often done in the recovery period.'  "
What is the recovery time after treatment of a Baker's cyst?,"'Recovery time depends on the form of treatment rendered. With medications or injections into the knee, recovery can be rapid, within days to weeks. If surgical repair is done, recovery generally takes one to three months.' "
Are there home remedies for a Baker's cyst?,"'Home remedies, prior to medical evaluation, include ''cold'' applications, resting, and avoiding overuse or injury to the involved knee.' "
What are potential complications of a Baker's cyst?,"""Complications of a Baker's cyst include blood clotting in the involved leg, as well as rupture of the Baker's cyst, causing swelling and ""'pain'' of the leg and ''bruising'' discoloration of the ankle.' "
What is the prognosis for a Baker's cyst?,"""Depending on the cause of the Baker's cyst, the outlook is generally very good. Baker's cysts caused by chronic arthritis can be prone to recur in the long term."" "
Is it possible to prevent a Baker's cyst?,"'There is no ''prevention'"" for a Baker's cyst except minimizing any underlying arthritis disease."" "
What are porphyrias?,"'Porphyrias are rare disorders that affect mainly the skin or nervous system and may cause ''abdominal pain''. These disorders are usually inherited, meaning they are caused by abnormalities in genes passed from parents to children. When a person has a porphyria, cells fail to change body chemicals called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors into heme, the substance that gives blood its red color. The body makes heme mainly in the bone marrow and ''liver''. Bone marrow is the soft, spongelike tissue inside the bones; it makes ''stem cells'' that develop into one of the three types of blood cells—''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and platelets.''The process of making heme is called the heme biosynthetic pathway. One of eight enzymes controls each step of the process. The body has a problem making heme if any one of the enzymes is at a low level, also called a deficiency. Porphyrins and porphyrin precursors of heme then build up in the body and cause illness.' "
What are the types of porphyria?,"'Each of the eight types of porphyria corresponds to low levels of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Experts often classify porphyrias as acute or cutaneous based on the symptoms a person experiences:''Experts also classify porphyrias as erythropoietic or hepatic:''Table 1 lists each type of porphyria, the deficient enzyme responsible for the disorder, and the main location of porphyrin buildup.''The exact rates of porphyria are unknown and vary around the world. For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is most common in the United States, and variegate porphyria is most common in South America.'   Acute porphyrias affect the nervous system. They occur rapidly and last only a short time. Cutaneous porphyrias affect the skin. Two types of acute porphyrias, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, can also have cutaneous symptoms. In erythropoietic porphyrias, the body overproduces porphyrins, mainly in the bone marrow. In hepatic porphyrias, the body overproduces porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, mainly in the liver."
What causes porphyria?,"'Most porphyrias are inherited disorders. Scientists have identified genes for all eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Most porphyrias result from inheriting an abnormal gene, also called a gene mutation, from one parent. Some porphyrias, such as congenital erythropoietic porphyria, hepatoerythropoietic porphyria, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, occur when a person inherits two abnormal genes, one from each parent. The likeliness of a person passing the abnormal gene or genes to the next generation depends on the type of porphyria.''Porphyria cutanea tarda is usually an acquired disorder, meaning factors other than genes cause the enzyme deficiency. This type of porphyria can be triggered by''For all types of porphyria, symptoms can be triggered by' too much iron use of alcohol or estrogen smoking chronic hepatitis C - a long-lasting liver disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, of the liver HIV - the virus that causes AIDS abnormal genes associated with hemochromatosis - the most common form of iron overload disease, which causes the body to absorb too much iron use of alcohol smoking use of certain medications or hormones exposure to sunlight stress dieting and fasting"
What are the symptoms of porphyria?,"'Some people with porphyria-causing gene mutations have latent porphyria, meaning they have no symptoms of the disorder. Symptoms of cutaneous porphyrias include''Symptoms of acute porphyrias include''Symptoms of acute porphyrias can develop over hours or days and last for days or weeks. These symptoms can come and go over time, while symptoms of cutaneous porphyrias tend to be more continuous. Porphyria symptoms can vary widely in severity.''\xa0'   oversensitivity to sunlight blisters on exposed areas of the skin itching and swelling on exposed areas of the skin pain in the abdomen—the area between the chest and hips pain in the chest, limbs, or back nausea and vomiting constipation—a condition in which an adult has fewer than three bowel movements a week or a child has fewer than two bowel movements a week, depending on the person urinary retention—the inability to empty the bladder completely confusion hallucinations seizures and muscle weakness"
How is porphyria diagnosed?,"'A health care provider diagnoses porphyria with blood, urine, and ''stool'' tests. These tests take place at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility. A blood test involves drawing blood and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. For urine and stool tests, the patient collects a sample of urine or stool in a special container. A health care provider tests the samples in the office or sends them to a lab for analysis. High levels of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors in blood, urine, or stool indicate porphyria. A health care provider may also recommend DNA testing of a blood sample to look for known gene mutations that cause porphyrias.'  "
How is porphyria treated?,"'Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria the person has and the severity of the symptoms.''Acute Porphyrias''A health care provider treats acute porphyrias with heme or glucose loading to decrease the liver’s production of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. A patient receives heme intravenously once a day for 4 days. Glucose loading involves giving a patient a glucose solution by mouth or intravenously. Heme is usually more effective and is the treatment of choice unless symptoms are mild. In rare instances, if symptoms are severe, a health care provider will recommend liver transplantation to treat acute porphyria. In liver transplantation, a surgeon removes a diseased or an injured liver and replaces it with a healthy, whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor. A patient has liver transplantation surgery in a hospital under general anesthesia. Liver transplantation can cure liver failure.''Cutaneous Porphyrias''The most important step a person can take to treat a cutaneous porphyria is to avoid sunlight as much as possible. Other cutaneous porphyrias are treated as follows:''Secondary Porphyrinurias''Conditions called secondary porphyrinurias, such as disorders of the liver and bone marrow, as well as a number of ''drugs'', chemicals, and toxins are often mistaken for porphyria because they lead to mild or moderate increases in porphyrin levels in the urine. Only high—not mild or moderate—levels of porphyrin or porphyrin precursors lead to a diagnosis of porphyria.''Eating, ''Diet'', and ''Nutrition''People with an acute porphyria should eat a ''diet'' with an average-to-high level of carbohydrates. The recommended dietary allowance for carbohydrates is 130 g per day for adults and children 1 year of age or older; ''pregnant'' and ''breastfeeding'' women need higher intakes.\xa0\xa0People should avoid limiting intake of carbohydrates and calories, even for short periods of time, as this type of ''dieting'' or fasting can trigger symptoms. People with an acute porphyria who want to ''lose weight'' should talk with their health care providers about diets they can follow to lose weight gradually.''People undergoing therapeutic phlebotomies should drink plenty of milk, water, or juice before and after each procedure.''A health care provider may recommend vitamin and mineral ''supplements'' for people with a cutaneous porphyria.' Porphyria cutanea tarda. A health care provider treats porphyria cutanea tarda by removing factors that tend to activate the disease and by performing repeated therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron in the liver. Therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of about a pint of blood from a vein in the arm. A technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, such as a hospital, clinic, or bloodmobile. A patient does not require anesthesia. Another treatment approach is low-dose hydroxychloroquine tablets to reduce porphyrins in the liver. Erythropoietic protoporphyria. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria may be given beta-carotene or cysteine to improve sunlight tolerance, though these medications do not lower porphyrin levels. Experts recommend hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines and avoiding alcohol to prevent protoporphyric liver failure. A health care provider may use liver transplantation or a combination of medications to treat people who develop liver failure. Unfortunately, liver transplantation does not correct the primary defect, which is the continuous overproduction of protoporphyria by bone marrow. Successful bone marrow transplantations may successfully cure erythropoietic protoporphyria. A health care provider only considers bone marrow transplantation if the disease is severe and leading to secondary liver disease. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria or hepatoerythropoietic porphyria may need surgery to remove the spleen or blood transfusions to treat anemia. A surgeon removes the spleen in a hospital, and a patient receives general anesthesia. With a blood transfusion, a patient receives blood through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. A technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, and a patient does not need anesthesia."
What is portal hypertension?,"'The ''liver'' serves many purposes within the body from making carbohydrates, proteins and ''fats'"" to synthesizing bile to help digest food. Because of this, the liver requires a significant blood supply. As opposed to other organs in the body, the majority of this blood supply (75%) comes from the venous system through the portal system. Blood vessels from the stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and spleen converge and form the portal vein delivering nutrients and chemical building blocks to the liver. Once in the liver, the portal vein and hepatic artery (which accounts for 25% of the liver's blood supply) come together to form sinusoids, spaces where the blood is filtered. From there, blood makes its way to the vena cava, the largest vein in the body to return to the ""'heart''.''Portal ''hypertension'' describes elevated pressure within the portal system, including the portal vein and the tributary veins that drain into it. The pressure within the portal system is not normally measured and is not an issue except if an illness or disease occurs that makes it difficult for blood to flow through the liver tissue. This damming effect increases pressure within the portal venous system and causes potential problems with ''liver function''. It is the onset of symptoms associated with ''liver disease'' that might cause the health care professional to look for the presence of portal ''hypertension''.' "
What causes portal hypertension?,"'Portal ''hypertension'' occurs when there is an obstruction of blood flow through the liver, and pressure rises within the portal vein. This obstruction can be intrahepatic (intra=within +hepatic=liver), pre-hepatic (pre=before) or post- hepatic (post=after).''Intrahepatic causes of portal hypertension include ''cirrhosis'' and hepatic fibrosis or scarring. A wide variety of illnesses are implicated as the cause of portal hypertension. Examples include the following:''Post-hepatic causes are due to obstruction of blood flow from the liver to the heart and can include:'   Alcohol abuse, Hepatitis B and C infections, Fatty liver (NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), Wilson's disease, an abnormality of copper metabolism, Hemochromatosis (iron overload), excess iron buildup Cystic fibrosis Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening of the bile ducts Biliary atresia, poorly formed bile ducts Parasite infections such as schistosomiasis Portal vein thrombosis or blood clots within the portal vein Congenital portal vein atresia or failure of the portal vein to develop Hepatic vein thrombosis Inferior vena cava thrombosis Restrictive pericarditis, where the lining of the heart stiffens and does not allow the heart to relax and expand when blood returns to it. Causes may include tuberculosis, fungal infections, tumors, connective tissue disorders (for example, scleroderma), and complications from radiation therapy."
What are the symptoms of portal hypertension?,"'When blood cannot easily flow through the liver architecture (from portal vein to sinusoids to hepatic vein to vena cava), it tries to bypass the portal system, using the systemic venous system to return to the heart. Symptoms of portal hypertension are due to the complications of decreased blood flow through the liver, and from increased pressure within the veins where blood is shunted.'  Varices describe enlarged veins. Blood, meant for the portal system, is diverted to and gathers in other veins as it makes its way to the heart. These varices can occur in the esophagus, stomach, around the umbilicus and in the anus and rectum. Esophageal and gastric varices are at risk for life-threatening bleeding and can have signs and symptoms with vomiting blood and blood in the stool. Melena describes black, tarry stool that is the result of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Ascites describes abnormal fluid collection within the peritoneum (the sac that contains the intestines within the abdominal cavity) and is due to a combination of factors, including increased pressure in the portal system and decrease protein in the body. The liver produces the body's protein; portal hypertension and the underlying liver disease decrease its ability to function. Hepatic encephalopathy is another complication of liver disease, causing confusion and lethargy due to the buildup of waste products and the inability of the liver to adequately filter them. Splenomegaly or enlargement of the spleen. Because of portal hypertension, blood backs up, and this also can trap the components of blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) within the spleen causing anemia and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count in the bloodstream). Decreased white blood cell counts increase the risk of general infection. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection within the peritoneal sac within the abdomen, and is seen as a consequence of long-standing portal hypertension."
How is the diagnosis of portal hypertension made?,"'Portal hypertension usually is diagnosed well after the process has begun in the body, and only after a complication occurs. When a patient develops\xa0ascites or has gastrointestinal bleeding, the health care professional will look for potential causes, including portal hypertension.''Once the diagnosis is a possibility, it can be confirmed by blood tests, ''X-rays'', CT or ''MRI'', and ''endoscopy''. Pressures within the portal vein are not routinely measured except in specific situations (see TIPS procedure).' "
What is the treatment for portal hypertension?,"'Treatment for portal hypertension is often directed at preventing complications. This includes treating the underlying cause and avoidance of ''alcohol''. Because of the risk of further liver damage, ''over-the-counter'' medications that contain ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'', Panadol, for example) should also be avoided.'""Dietary restrictions include limiting salt to prevent further ascites fluid accumulation. Protein may also be restricted, since increased protein load can overwhelm the liver's ability to synthesize it and may lead to ""'hepatic encephalopathy''.''Medications such as ''beta-blockers'' and ''nitroglycerin'' may be appropriate to decrease pressure within the portal system. ''Lactulose'' may be prescribed as a treatment for hepatic ''encephalopathy''.''Endoscopy may be required to band or tie off varices in the esophagus to prevent catastrophic and life-threatening bleeding.''A TIPS procedure (''transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt'') may be an option to decrease the pressure within the portal system. An interventional radiologist attempts to place a tube that connects the portal vein with the hepatic vein. This may decrease the pressure within the liver and may also reduce pressure within the veins of the stomach and esophagus, hopefully decreasing the risk of bleeding.''If portal hypertension and liver dysfunction become bad enough, liver transplantation may be necessary.'  "
What are the complications of portal hypertension?,"'The complications of portal hypertension are the complications of liver failure. These include gastrointestinal bleeding from varices, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Splenomegaly can also cause ''anemia'', low white blood cell counts, and low platelet counts.' "
Can portal hypertension be prevented?,"'Some liver diseases due to inborn errors of metabolism like copper and iron cannot be prevented. The same can be said with congenital anatomy problems. However, when liver disease is due to alcohol and ''drug abuse'', ''prevention'' is a real possibility. Chronic ''alcoholism'' can lead to ''cirrhosis'' and portal hypertension. IV ''drug abuse'' can be the cause of ''hepatitis B'' and C, resulting in cirrhosis.' "
What is the prognosis for portal hypertension?,"'Portal hypertension is a complication of an underlying liver disease. It is a disease that can be controlled but requires patients to be compliant with dietary restrictions and to abstain from alcohol and ''drugs''. Survival rates can be quite high as long as some liver function is maintained. The worse the liver function, the worse the prognosis.' "
What is an autopsy?,"'An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues. In academic institutions, autopsies sometimes are also requested for teaching and research purposes. Forensic autopsies have legal implications and are performed to determine if death was an accident, homicide, ''suicide'', or a natural event. The word autopsy is derived from the Greek word autopsia: ""to see with one\'s own eyes.""' "
Who determines whether an autopsy is performed?,"'A medical examiner can order an autopsy without the consent of the next-of-kin. Deaths that are investigated by the medical examiner or coroner include all suspicious deaths, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include deaths of persons not being treated by a physician for a known medical condition, deaths of those who have been under medical care for less than 24 hours, or deaths that occurred during operations or other medical procedures.''In all other cases, consent must be obtained from the next-of-kin before an autopsy is performed, even at academic institutions or hospitals. The next-of-kin also has the right to limit the scope of the autopsy (for example, excluding the brain from evaluation or limiting the procedure to examination of the abdomen).' "
How is an autopsy performed?,"'The extent of an autopsy can vary from the examination of a single organ such as the ''heart'' or brain, to a very extensive examination. Examination of the chest, abdomen, and brain is probably considered by most pathologists as the standard scope of the autopsy.''The autopsy begins with a complete external examination. The weight and height of the body are recorded, and identifying marks such as ''scars'' and tattoos also are recorded.''The internal examination begins with the creation of a Y or U- shaped incision from both shoulders joining over the sternum and continuing down to the pubic bone. The skin and underlying tissues are then separated to expose the rib cage and abdominal ''cavity''. The front of the rib cage is removed to expose the neck and chest organs. This opening allows the trachea (windpipe), thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, ''esophagus'', heart, thoracic ''aorta'' and ''lungs'' to be removed. Following removal of the neck and chest organs, the abdominal organs are cut (dissected) free. These include the ''intestines'', ''liver'', gallbladder and bile duct system, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, abdominal aorta, and reproductive organs.''To remove the brain, an incision is made in the back of the skull from one ear to the other. The ''scalp'' is cut and separated from the underlying skull and pulled forward. The top of the skull is removed using a vibrating saw. The entire brain is then gently lifted out of the cranial vault. The spinal cord may also be taken by removing the anterior or posterior portion of the spinal column.''The organs are first examined by the pathologist to note any changes visible with the naked eye. Examples of diseases that may produce changes readily recognizable in the organs include ''atherosclerosis'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''coronary artery disease'' in the heart. ''After the organs are removed from the body, they usually are separated from each other and further dissected to reveal any abnormalities, such as tumors, on the inside. Small samples are typically taken from all organs to be made into slide preparations for examination under a microscope. At the end of an autopsy, the incisions made in the body are sewn closed. The organs may be returned to the body or may be retained for teaching, research, and diagnostic purposes. Performance of an autopsy does not interfere with an open casket funeral service, as none of the incisions made in order to accomplish the autopsy are apparent after embalming and dressing of the body by the mortician.' "
What other special studies may be done as part of the autopsy?,"'Pictures of findings may be taken for future reference. Special studies may include cultures to identify infectious agents, chemical analysis for the measurement of drug levels or metabolic abnormalities, or genetic studies. Tissue may be frozen for future diagnostic or research purposes. Organs may be preserved and stored in formalin for later examination, sampling for microscopy, presentation at conferences, or archiving for the training of medical students.' "
What is the autopsy report?,"""After all studies are completed, a detailed report is prepared that describes the autopsy procedure and microscopic findings, gives a list of medical diagnoses, and a summary of the case. The report emphasizes the relationship or correlation between clinical findings (the doctor's examination, laboratory tests, radiology findings, etc.) and pathologic findings (those made from the autopsy)."" "
Why is the autopsy rate declining?,"'Beginning in the 1950s, hospital autopsy rates started falling from an average of around 50% of all deaths to 10% in the late 1990s. Currently, the rates are even lower at non-academic hospitals. In 1970, the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals dropped the requirement that a hospital needed an autopsy rate of 20% to be accredited.''Family factors:'' Certainly the relationship between patients and their doctors has changed dramatically over the past 50 years due to factors such as specialization, managed care, and the disappearance of the ""house call."" Physicians no longer are ""family doctors"" and do not have the same rapport with patients and their families as in past years. This change in the basic doctor-patient relationship may make it increasingly difficult to obtain consent for an autopsy.''Concerns over disfigurement of the remains or delays in funeral arrangements may prevent a vast majority of families from consenting to an autopsy. In reality, however, the visual examination of the body and the removal of tissues and organs for microscopic examination can be completed in a few hours. Furthermore, there are no visible external changes that would preclude an open-casket funeral service.''In the majority of cases and certainly at academic medical centers, there is currently no charge to the family and frequently, no compensation for its performance. More recently, though, some institutions have started to charge and private autopsies at the request of family members that are performed outside of the hospital may cost several thousand dollars.''Clinician factors: ''Most physicians are generally uncomfortable requesting an autopsy because it is not an easy or pleasant task. If, in addition, a physician feels that a family questions the care that their relative was given, the physician may be reluctant to request an autopsy that might prove that the care was indeed incorrect.''Many individuals in medicine feel that modern technology has made the autopsy outdated or obsolete. With modern imaging studies and laboratory tests, it is thought that the autopsy is unlikely to reveal any conditions that were not detected clinically. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis has been the subject of numerous research studies. These studies have consistently shown that in 20% to 40% of autopsied patients, there were important, treatable conditions that were detected at autopsy that were not diagnosed clinically. This consistent and significant discrepancy between clinical and pathologic diagnoses is probably the most compelling argument for continued efforts to revive the autopsy as the ""gold standard"" in evaluating the quality of medical care.''Pathologist factors: ''Some doctors express dissatisfaction with the quality of an autopsy if the pathologist does not provide answers regarding the case. Unfortunately, an autopsy does not guarantee that the cause of death, for example a heart ''arrhythmia'', will be identified.'""Autopsy pathology is a vanishing subspecialty, which, for the most part, has been relegated to a secondary position. At the turn of the century, most of the pathologist's activities revolved around the autopsy. Since that time, laboratory medicine and surgical pathology (examining tissue biopsies from living patients) have become the major activities of practicing pathologists.""'In addition, the autopsy is not one of the favorite activities among the majority of pathologists. For many pathologists, an autopsy is an extra burden with no compensation during a busy day.' "
What are the benefits of autopsies?,"'Benefits for families:'"" For families, the autopsy has both tangible and psychological benefits. Uncertainty regarding the cause of an individual's death can delay payment of insurance benefits. The autopsy can also uncover genetic or environmental (for example, a bacterium or fungus) causes of disease that could affect other family members. Psychologically, the autopsy provides closure by identifying or confirming the cause of death. The autopsy can demonstrate to the family that the care provided was appropriate, thereby alleviating guilt among family members and offering reassurance regarding the quality of medical care. Lastly, the autopsy is a mechanism that enables the family to participate in medical education and research.""'Benefits for the clinician and hospital:'' The procedure can confirm the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses and the appropriateness of medical care. The autopsy findings can be utilized to educate physicians, nurses, residents, and students, thereby contributing to an improved quality of care.''Benefits to society:'' Many of the benefits of the autopsy are experienced by society as a whole. The autopsy aids in the evaluation of new diagnostic tests, the assessment of new therapeutic interventions (''drugs'', devices, surgical techniques), and the investigation of environmental and occupational diseases. Autopsy data are useful in establishing valid mortality statistics. Data derived from death certificates in the absence of autopsy data have repeatedly been shown to be inaccurate. New medical knowledge on existing diseases that is derived from autopsy-based research is clearly important for everyone. Remarkably, new diseases continue to emerge which can only be fully investigated by autopsy.' "
Who pays for autopsies?,"""Presently, there is no direct funding to hospitals or doctors for autopsies. As part of the federal government's Medicare funding to hospitals, reimbursement for autopsies is theoretically included in fixed payments that hospitals receive. Thus, the federal government contends that it is paying for autopsies. Since these funds are not specifically earmarked for autopsies, they may not reach the pathology department or pathologist. Managed care organizations consider the autopsy to be built into their hospital contracts. However, these organizations have stated that they are willing to reimburse for autopsies if and when they are convinced of their value. Sometimes in hospital autopsies performed at the request of physicians, the autopsy is not billed to the patient's family, but they should check with the hospital performing the service. This is different from autopsies the family requests of private pathologists, which may lead to charges billed to the deceased's next-of-kin.""'In our litigation-oriented society, a growing proportion of private-pay autopsies are motivated by distrust, anger, and a desire to sue the potentially responsible physician(s) and hospital. Several groups of pathologists and business persons throughout the country are marketing their autopsy services through direct mail, newspapers, funeral homes, and online. Whether the quality and objectivity of these private autopsies will match those of general hospitals and academic medical centers remains to be determined.' "
What is the history of the autopsy?,"'The earliest anatomists and pathologists could be considered ancient hunters, butchers, and cooks who had to recognize organs and determine if they were suitably edible. In ancient Babylon, perhaps as early as 3500 BC, autopsies on animals were performed not for the study of disease, but rather for the practice of predicting the future by communicating with divine forces. The intestines and liver were believed to contain messages from divine spirits.'""Galen (131-200 A.D.), a disciple of Hippocrates practicing in ancient Greece, performed surgical dismantling (dissection) of animals and humans. He determined that Hippocrates' theory that disease was due to four circulating humours (""'phlegm'', blood, yellow bile, and black bile) was correct. Galen was a highly respected, powerful, and dogmatic individual who dominated the medical thinking of his time and for hundreds of years to follow. It is said that the four humour doctrine paralyzed medical science for about 1400 years.''In general, before 1700 there was a negative attitude regarding dissection of the ''human body''. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and medieval Europeans performed dissections for religious reasons or to learn anatomy, but this was not done in any systematic fashion. There were, however, some notable exceptions. In the late 1200s the law faculty dominated the University of Bologna and would order autopsies to be performed to help solve legal problems. Thus, some of the earliest autopsies were medicolegal cases. In the late 1400s in Padua and Bologna, Italy, the sites of the world\'s first medical schools, Pope Sixtus the IV issued an edict permitting dissection of the human body by medical students. Before such edicts from religious leaders, it was considered a crime to dissect the human body and criminal prosecutions for ""body snatching"" by students of anatomy date back to the early 1300s.''By the 1500s, the autopsy was generally accepted by the Catholic Church, marking the way for an accepted systematic approach for the study of human pathology. While a number of ""giants"" around this time, such as Vesalius (1514-1564), Pare (1510-1590), Lancisi (1654- 1720), and Boerhaave (1668-1738) advanced the autopsy, it is Giovanni Bathista Morgagni (1682-1771) who has been considered the first great autopsist. During his 60 years of observations, Morgagni insisted upon correlation of pathological findings with clinical symptoms, marking the first time that autopsies made major contributions to the understanding of disease in medical science.'""Some historians say that the power of the autopsy in medical education peaked during the 1800s. In the beginning of that century the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Vienna was considered the premiere medical center of the Western World, in large part because of the stature of its Pathology Institute which was headed by Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878). Almost every patient who died was taken to the Rokitansky Institute, which still exists in Vienna, for autopsy. Rokitansky is said to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years. Rokitansky stressed a systematic, almost ritualistic, approach to the autopsy with every patient receiving the same detailed examination. For the sake of objectivity, Rokitansky, unlike Morgagni, did not care to know the clinical history of the patients. Because of this style and his disinclination to apply microscopy in a routine fashion, many of Rokitansky's theories about diseases proved to be incorrect.""'Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902), an eminent German statesman and pathologist, was a younger contemporary and competitor of Rokitansky. Unlike Rokitansky, he grew up with the microscope, and was most influential in the systematic application of microscopy to study disease. Virchow advanced the doctrine which held that cellular pathology was the basis of disease, finally laying to rest the humoural theory of Hippocrates and Galen. In many ways, Virchow could be considered the first molecular biologist. Under Virchow, Berlin replaced Vienna as the premier center of medical education.''Many clinicians, upon returning from study in Berlin, became leaders in North American medicine. The most notable of these physicians was the legendary Sir William Osler, who worked in Canada and the US. Osler was arguably the most respected and revered North American physician of his time. He studied with Rokitansky and Virchow and relied heavily on autopsy studies for his own education. Osler not only performed autopsies himself and taught others from autopsies, but also left detailed instructions for his own autopsy. In speaking of himself, Osler told a friend: ""I\'ve been watching this case for 2 months and I\'m sorry I shall not see the postmortem."" As expected, the autopsy showed that all of Osler\'s diagnoses were correct.''In 1910, Abraham Flexner reported the sorry state of medical education in the U. S. at that time. The Cabot report issued from the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1920, based on approximately 3000 autopsies performed, revealed astonishing diagnostic inaccuracies on the part of clinicians. Resulting medical reforms included the placement of autopsy pathology as a central, integral component of medical education.' "
Should the autopsy be revived?,"'Government agencies that regulate the accreditation of hospitals and ''nursing'' homes are deeply concerned about the decline in autopsy rates. For example, surveys have indicated that less than 1% of nursing home patients who die are autopsied. The U.S. general accounting office, which pays for some nursing home services, recently attempted to prove that particular nursing homes were substandard. Such efforts were thwarted by the lack of hard evidence. The allegations could not be proven because the patients in question were not autopsied and the actual ''causes of death'' could not, therefore, be confirmed.''Some information can only be acquired during an autopsy. The information autopsies can provide benefits society, the medical profession, and families. Many physicians believe that autopsy should be revived. Whether or not it will be revived remains to be seen.' "
What is post-polio syndrome?,'Post-''polio'' syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors years after recovery from an initial acute attack of the poliomyelitis virus. Post-polio syndrome is mainly characterized by new weakening in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection and in muscles that seemingly were unaffected. ' 
What are the symptoms of post-polio syndrome?,"'Symptoms include slowly progressive muscle ''weakness'', unaccustomed ''fatigue'' (both generalized and muscular), and, at times, muscle atrophy. ''Pain'' from joint degeneration and increasing skeletal deformities such as ''scoliosis'' are common. Some patients experience only minor symptoms. While less common, others may develop visible muscle atrophy, or wasting.''Post-polio syndrome is rarely life-threatening. However, untreated respiratory muscle weakness can result in underventilation, and weakness in swallowing muscles can result in aspiration ''pneumonia''. ''The severity of residual weakness and disability after acute poliomyelitis tends to predict the development of post-polio syndrome. Patients who had minimal symptoms from the original illness will most likely experience only mild post-polio syndrome symptoms. People originally hit hard by the poliovirus and who attained a greater recovery may develop a more severe case of post-polio syndrome with a greater loss of muscle function and more severe ''fatigue''. It should be noted that many polio survivors were too young to remember the severity of their original illness and that accurate memory fades over time. ''According to estimates by the National Center for Health Statistics, more than 440,000 polio survivors in the United States may be at risk for post-polio syndrome. Researchers are unable to establish a firm prevalence rate, but they estimate that the condition affects 25 percent to 50 percent of these survivors, or possibly as many as 60 percent, depending on how the disorder is defined and which study is quoted. ''Patients diagnosed with post-polio syndrome sometimes are concerned that they are having polio again and are ''contagious'' to others. Studies have shown that this does not happen. '  "
What causes post-polio syndrome?,"'The cause is unknown. However, the new weakness of post-polio syndrome appears to be related to the degeneration of individual nerve terminals in the motor units that remain after the initial illness. A motor unit is a nerve cell (or neuron) and the muscle fibers it activates. The poliovirus attacks specific neurons in the brainstem and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. In an effort to compensate for the loss of these neurons, ones that survive sprout new nerve terminals to the orphaned muscle fibers. The result is some recovery of movement and enlarged motor units.''Years of high use of these enlarged motor units adds ''stress'"" to the neuronal cell body, which then may not be able to maintain the metabolic demands of all the new sprouts, resulting in the slow deterioration of motor units. Restoration of nerve function may occur in some fibers a second time, but eventually nerve terminals malfunction and permanent weakness occurs. This hypothesis is consistent with post-polio syndrome's slow, stepwise, unpredictable course. ""'Through years of studies, scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' and at other institutions have shown that the weakness of post-polio syndrome is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities. ' "
How is post-polio syndrome diagnosed?,"'Physicians arrive at a diagnosis of post-polio syndrome by completing a comprehensive medical history and neuromuscular examination and by excluding other disorders that could explain the symptoms. Researchers and physicians typically use the following criteria to establish a diagnosis: ''Criteria for diagnosis of post-polio syndrome*''*Modified from: Post-Polio Syndrome: Identifying Best Practices in Diagnosis & Care. March of Dimes, 2001. ''Post-polio syndrome may be difficult to diagnose in some people because other medical conditions can complicate the evaluation. ''Depression'', for example, also is associated with fatigue and can be misinterpreted as post-polio syndrome or vice versa. For this reason, some clinicians use less restrictive diagnostic criteria, while others prefer to categorize new problems as the late effects of polio—for example, shoulder ''osteoarthritis'' from ''walking'' with crutches, a chronic ''rotator cuff tear'' leading to ''pain'' and disuse weakness, or breathing insufficiency due to progressive scoliosis. ''Polio survivors with post-polio syndrome symptoms need to visit a physician trained in neuromuscular disorders to clearly establish potential causes for declining strength and to assess progression of weakness not explained by other health problems. ''Physicians may use ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), computed tomography (CT), neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies as tools to investigate the course of decline in muscle strength. Less commonly, they will conduct a muscle biopsy or a spinal fluid analysis. These tests are also important to exclude other, possibly treatable, conditions that mimic post-polio syndrome, but the tests do not identify survivors at greatest risk for new progression of muscle weakness. ''It is important to remember that polio survivors may acquire other illnesses and should always have regular check-ups and preventive diagnostic tests, such as mammograms, pap smears, and ''colorectal'' exams. ' Prior paralytic poliomyelitis with evidence ofmotor neuron loss, as confirmed by history of the acute paralytic illness, signs of residual weakness and atrophy of muscles on neuromuscular examination, and signs of nerve damage on electromyography (EMG). Rarely, persons have subclinical paralytic polio, described as a loss of motor neurons during acute polio but with no obvious deficit. That prior polio now needs to be confirmed with an EMG. Also, a reported history of nonparalytic polio may be inaccurate.  A period of partial or complete functional recovery after acute paralytic poliomyelitis, followed by an interval (usually 15 years or more) of stable neuromuscular function.  Gradual onset of progressive and persistent new muscle weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability (decreased endurance), with or without generalized fatigue, muscle atrophy, or muscle and joint pain. Onset may at times follow trauma, surgery, or a period of inactivity, and can appear to be sudden. Less commonly, symptoms attributed to post-polio syndrome include new problems with breathing or swallowing. Symptoms that persist for at least a year.  Exclusion of other neuromuscular, medical, and orthopedic problems as causes of symptoms. "
How is post-polio syndrome treated?,"'There are currently no effective pharmaceutical or specific treatments for the syndrome itself. However, a number of controlled studies have demonstrated that nonfatiguing exercises can improve muscle strength. ''Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have tried treating post-polio syndrome patients with alpha-2 recombinant ''interferon'', but the treatment proved ineffective. Another study in which post-polio syndrome patients received high doses of ''prednisone'"" demonstrated a mild improvement in their condition, but the results were not statistically significant. This, in addition to the drug's side effects, led researchers to recommend that prednisone not be used to treat post-polio syndrome.""'In an effort to reduce fatigue, increase strength, and improve quality of life in post-polio syndrome patients, scientists conducted two controlled studies using low doses of the drug ''pyridostigmine'' (''Mestinon''). These studies showed that pyridostigmine is not helpful for post-polio syndrome patients. ''In another controlled study scientists concluded that the drug ''amantadine'' (Symmetrel) is not helpful in reducing fatigue. And other researchers recently evaluated the effectiveness of ''modafinil'' (''Provigil'') on reducing fatigue and found no benefit.''Preliminary studies indicate that intravenous immunoglobin may reduce pain, increase quality of life, and improve strength. Research into its use is ongoing. ''The future of post-polio syndrome treatment may center on nerve growth factors. Since post-polio syndrome may result from the degeneration of nerve sprouts, growth factors can target these and help to regenerate new ones. Unfortunately, one small study that NINDS scientists participated in showed that ''insulin''-like growth factor (IGF-1), which can enhance the ability of motor neurons to sprout new branches and maintain existing branches, was not helpful. ''Although there is no cure, there are recommended management strategies. Seek medical advice from a physician experienced in treating neuromuscular disorders. Do not attribute all signs and symptoms to prior polio. Use judicious ''exercise'', preferably under the supervision of an experienced professional. Use recommended mobility aids, ventilatory equipment, and revised activities of daily living. Avoid activities that cause pain or fatigue that lasts more than 10 minutes. Pace daily activities to avoid rapid muscle tiring and total body exhaustion.''Learning about post-polio syndrome is important for polio survivors and their families. Management of post-polio syndrome can involve lifestyle changes. Support groups that encourage self-help, group participation, and positive action can be helpful. For some, individual or family counseling may be needed to adjust to the late effects of poliomyelitis, because experiencing new symptoms and using assistive devices may bring back distressing memories of the original illness.

What is the role of exercise in the treatment of post-polio syndrome?,"'The symptoms of pain, weakness, and fatigue can result from the overuse and misuse of muscles and joints. These same symptoms can also result from disuse of muscles and joints. This fact has caused a misunderstanding about whether to encourage or discourage ''exercise'' for polio survivors or individuals who already have post-polio syndrome. ''Exercise is safe and effective when carefully prescribed and monitored by experienced health professionals. Exercise is more likely to benefit those muscle groups that were least affected by polio. Cardiopulmonary endurance training is usually more effective than strengthening exercises. Heavy or intense resistive exercise and weight-lifting using polio-affected muscles may be counterproductive because they can further weaken rather than strengthen these muscles. ''Exercise prescriptions should include''Exercise should be reduced or discontinued if additional weakness, excessive fatigue, or unduly prolonged recovery time is noted by either the individual with post-polio syndrome or the professional monitoring the exercise.

Can post-polio syndrome be prevented?,"'Polio survivors often ask if there is a way to prevent post-polio syndrome. Presently, no intervention has been found to stop the deterioration of surviving neurons. But physicians recommend that polio survivors get the proper amount of ''sleep'', maintain a well-balanced ''diet'', avoid unhealthy habits such assmoking and overeating, and follow an exercise program as discussed above.

''Determining if there is an immunological link in post-polio syndrome is also an area of intense interest. Researchers who discovered inflammation around motor neurons or muscles are trying to find out if this is due to an immunological response.''Other investigators have discovered that fragments of the poliovirus, or mutated versions of it, are in the spinal fluid of some survivors. The significance of this finding is not known and more research is being done. ' "

What are rhinitis and post-nasal drip? What are the symptoms and signs?,"'Rhinitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the nose and it has many different causes. Rhinitis is a very common condition. Symptoms include:''A significant association exists between rhinitis (allergic), ''asthma'', and chronic ''sinusitis'' (inflammation of the sinuses for more than 12 weeks) in some individuals. Some evidence suggests that up to 3 of every 5 patients have multiple conditions.''Post-nasal drip'' is mucus accumulation in the back of the nose and throat leading to, or giving the sensation of, mucus dripping downward from the back of the nose. One of the most common characteristics of chronic rhinitis is post-nasal drip. Post-nasal drip may lead to ''chronic sore throat'', ''chronic cough'', or throat clearing. Post-nasal drip can be caused by excessive or thick mucus secretions or impairment in the normal clearance of mucus from the nose and throat.'   Runny nose (rhinorrhea) Nasal itching Nasal congestion Sneezing"
What causes rhinitis?,"'Rhinitis has many possible causes. Rhinitis can be either acute or chronic, and is categorized into three areas: allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, and mixed rhinitis (a combination of allergic and non-allergic).''Allergic rhinitis'' is the most common cause of rhinitis. It is caused by environmental ''allergies'' and is characterized by an ''itchy'' or runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion. Other allergic symptoms include:''People with allergic rhinitis also have a higher incidence of ''asthma'' and ''eczema'', which are also mainly allergic in origin.''Seasonal allergic rhinitis'' (hay ''fever'') is usually caused by ''pollen'' in the air, and sensitive patients have symptoms during peak times during the year.''Perennial allergic rhinitis'', a type of chronic rhinitis is a year-round problem, and is often caused by ''indoor allergens'' (particles that cause ''allergies''), such as dust and animal dander in addition to pollens that may exist at the time. Symptoms tend to occur regardless of the time of the year.'   Itchy ears and throat Red or watery eyes Cough Fatigue/loss of concentration/lack of energy from loss of sleep Headaches or facial tenderness (not typical)"
Is rhinitis always related to allergies?,"'No, rhinitis may have many causes other than ''allergies''.''Non-allergic rhinitis ''occurs in those individuals in whom an allergic or other cause of rhinitis cannot be identified, and the rhinitis occurs for weeks to months at a time for at least a year. These conditions may not have the other allergic manifestations, such as itchy and runny eyes, and are more persistent and less seasonal.''Forms of non-allergic rhinitis include:''Occupational rhinitis'"" may arise from exposure to irritants at a person's workplace with improvement of symptoms after the person leaves the workplace.""'Other causes of rhinitis may be related to:''Infections, mostly viral, are a common cause of rhinitis. ''Viral rhinitis ''is usually not chronic and may resolve by itself.''Sometimes rhinitis may be related to other generalized medical conditions such as:' Idiopathic rhinitis often does not have a specific cause identified, but commonly includes upper respiratory infections. Vasomotor rhinitis is thought to occur because of abnormal regulation of nasal blood flow and may be induced by temperature fluctuations in the environment, such as cold or dry air, or irritants such as:Air pollutionSmogTobacco smokeCar exhaustStrong odors such as detergents or fragrancesWeather conditions (such as the arrival of a weather front) Air pollution Smog Tobacco smoke Car exhaust Strong odors such as detergents or fragrances Weather conditions (such as the arrival of a weather front) Gustatory rhinitis may present predominantly as runny nose (rhinorrhea) related to consumption of hot or spicy food. Rhinitis of pregnancy or, generally speaking, hormonal alterations as seen with pregnancy, menopause, and some thyroid changes have been linked to rhinitis. Atrophic rhinitis following extensive sinus surgery or from a rare nasal bacterial infection. Non-allergic rhinitis with nasal eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) is characterized by a clear nasal discharge. The nasal discharge is found to have eosinophils (allergic cell type), although the patient may not have any other evidence of allergy by skin testing or history or symptoms. Certain medications (oral contraceptives, some blood pressure medications, some anxiety medications, some erectile dysfunction medications, and some anti-inflammatory medications) Some nasal structural abnormalities (deviated septum, perforated septum, tumors, nasal polyps, or foreign bodies) Acid reflux disease (GERD) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis Sarcoidosis Cystic fibrosis Other less common conditions"
What conditions cause an abnormal production of nasal secretions?,"'The following conditions are often associated with increased nasal drainage (runny nose). It is common to have more than one factor involved in a particular individual.''Decreasing the fluid content of the mucus usually thickens the secretions leading to the impression of increased mucus. The following may cause thickened secretions:'   Viruses Allergies Cold temperatures Certain foods or spices Pregnancy or hormonal changes Drug side-effects (particularly certain high blood pressure medications) Structural problems (deviated septum, large turbinates) Vasomotor rhinitis (an abnormal regulatory problem with the nose) Low humidity Sinus or nasal infections Foreign bodies (especially if the drainage is from one side) Environmental irritants (tobacco smoke, smog) Structural problems (deviated septum, enlarged turbinates, enlarged adenoids) Advanced age -- mucus membrane lining the nose can shrink with age leading to a reduced volume of secretions that are thicker Hormonal problems Drug side effects (antihistamines)"
What conditions cause an impaired clearance of nasal secretions?,"'The primary reason for impaired clearance of nasal secretions within the nasal ''cavities'' is from ''smoking''. ''Smoking'' impairs the movement of the cilia (microscopic hairs) and their ability to push the secretions out of the nasal ''cavity'' to be swallowed. Other conditions that can impact clearance of secretions in the nose include allergies and some genetic disorders.''Swallowing problems'' can make it difficult to clear normal secretions from the back of the throat. This may result in the accumulation of material in the throat, which can spill into the voice box, causing ''hoarseness'', throat clearing, or cough. The following factors can contribute to swallowing problems:' Advancing age: This will lead to decreased strength and coordination in swallowing. Stress: Stress leads to muscle spasm or ""lump in throat."" A nervous habit of frequent throat clearing also will make the condition worse. Narrowing of the throat due to tumors or other conditions: This will impair the passage of food. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Nerve or muscle disorders: (stroke, and muscle diseases, etc.)"
Which specialties of doctors treat chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip?," A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child's pediatrician may diagnose chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip. If chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip are due to allergies you may see an allergist/immunologist. If chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip are due to asthma, you may see a pulmonologist, a specialist in conditions affecting the lungs. If the conditions are severe or recurrent, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, also called an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist, for further treatment. If you get chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip during pregnancy, you may be referred to your obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN). If acid reflux disease (GERD) is the cause of your chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip, you may see a gastroenterologist, a specialist in conditions of the digestive tract."
How can chronic rhinitis and post-nasal drip be treated?,"'The treatment generally is directed toward the underlying cause.''An ''allergy'' is an exaggerated ""normal body"" inflammatory response to an outside substance. These substances that cause allergies are called allergens, and typically include:''The best treatment is avoidance of these allergens, but in many cases this may be very difficult if not impossible. Some helpful suggestions include:''Avoidance of nasal irritants:'' Nasal irritants usually do not lead to the typical immune response seen with classical allergies, but nevertheless they can mimic or make allergies worse, as in vasomotor rhinitis. Examples of these irritants include ''cigarette'' smoke, perfume, aerosol sprays, smoke, smog, and car exhaust.'""A health care professional may identify possible allergens by taking a very careful history. Details of the patient's possible exposure to allergens or irritants at home or the workplace may give clues. An ""'allergy'' specialist (allergy and immunologist) can perform skin tests to try to identify common environmental allergies.'   Pollen Mold Animal dander (cats and dogs) House dust Dust mites and cockroaches Some foods Use a pollen mask when mowing the grass or cleaning the house. Install an air purifier or at least change the air filters monthly in heating and air conditioning systems. Use cotton or synthetic materials such as Dacron in pillows and bedding. Enclose mattress in plastic. Select dust-mite proof pillow covers. Consider using a humidifier. Keep windows closed during high pollen times. Eliminate house plants. Bathe pets frequently or do not adopt or purchase dander-producing pets."
What medications can be used to treat rhinitis and post-nasal drip?,"'In addition to measures noted above, medications may also be used for the treatment and relief of rhinitis and post-nasal drip.''For allergic rhinitis and post-nasal drip, many medications are used. It also is essential to attempt to avoid the offending allergic particles.''Intra-nasal glucocorticoids (steroid sprays applied directly into the nose) are often recommended as the first line of treatment. Steroids are potent anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agents and may relieve most of the associated symptoms of runny and itchy nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drip.''Their use must be monitored and tapered by the prescribing physician, as long-term use may have significant side effects. Examples of the nasal steroids include:''These are generally used once or twice daily. Tilt the head forward during administration to avoid spraying the back of the throat instead of the nose.''Oral steroids''These ''drugs'' -- for example, ''prednisone'', ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol''), and hydrocortisone (''Hydrocortone'', ''Cortef'') -- are highly effective in allergic patients. They are best used for short-term management of allergic problems, and a health care professional must always monitor their use, as there are potential serious side effects when using these medications for extended periods. These are reserved only for very severe cases that do not respond to the usual treatment with nasal steroids and antihistamines.''Allergy medications such as antihistamines are also frequently used to treat allergic rhinitis and post-nasal drip. These are generally used as the second line of treatment after the nasal steroids or in combination with them. Histamines are naturally occurring chemicals released in response to an exposure to an ''allergen'', which are responsible for the congestion, sneezing, and runny nose typical of an ''allergic reaction''. Antihistamines are drugs that block the histamine reaction. These medications work best when given prior to exposure.''Antihistamines can be divided into two groups:''There is a nasal ''antihistamine'' preparation that has been shown to be very effective in treating allergic rhinitis, called ''azelastine'' nasal (''Astelin'').''Decongestant'' sprays''Examples of decongestant sprays include:''Decongestant sprays quickly reduce swelling of nasal tissues by shrinking the blood vessels. They improve ''breathing'' and drainage over the short-term, and their use should be limited to 3 to 5 days because of the potential for rebound ''addiction''. If they are used for more than a few days, they can become highly addictive (rhinitis medicamentosa). Long-term use can lead to serious damage.''Oral decongestants''Oral decongestants temporarily reduce swelling of sinus and nasal tissues leading to an improvement of breathing and a decrease in obstruction. They may also stimulate the ''heart'' and raise the blood pressure and should be avoided by patients who have ''high blood pressure'', heart irregularities, ''glaucoma'', thyroid problems, or difficulty in urination. The most common decongestant is pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed'').''Cromolyn'' sodium (Nasalcrom)''Cromolyn sodium (Nasalcrom) is a spray that helps to stabilize allergy cells (mast cells) by preventing release of allergy mediators, like histamine. They are most effective if used before the start of allergy season or prior to exposure to a known allergen.''Montelukast'' (''Singulair'')''Montelukast (Singulair) is an agent that acts similarly to antihistamine, although it is involved in another pathway in allergic response. Research shows it to be less beneficial than the steroid nasal sprays, but equally as effective as some of the antihistamines. It may be useful in patients who do not wish to use nasal sprays or those who have co-existing asthma.''Ipratropium (''Atrovent'' nasal)''Ipratropium (Atrovent nasal) is used as a nasal spray and helps to control nasal drainage mediated by neural pathways. It will not treat an allergy, but it does decrease nasal drainage.''Mucus thinning agents''Mucus thinning agents are utilized to make secretions thinner and less sticky. They help to prevent pooling of secretions in the back of the nose and throat where they often cause choking. The thinner secretions pass more easily. ''Guaifenesin'' (''Humibid'', Fenesin, Organidin) is a commonly used formulation. If a ''rash'' develops or there is swelling of the salivary glands, this medication should be discontinued. Inadequate fluid intake will also thicken secretions.\xa0Drinking more water, eliminating ''caffeine'' from the ''diet'', and avoiding diuretics can help.''Immunotherapy'""Immunotherapy treatment has a goal of reducing a person's response to an allergen. After identification of an allergen, small amounts are given back to the sensitive patient. Over time, the patient will develop blocking antibodies to the allergen and will become less sensitive and less reactive to the substance causing allergic symptoms. The allergens are given in the form of ""'allergy shots'' or by delivery of the allergen under the tongue (sublingual therapy). Sublingual therapy has been more common in Europe. In either method, the goal is to interfere with the allergic response to specific allergens to which the patient is sensitive.''Combinations''These drugs are made up of one or more anti-allergy medications. They are usually a combination of an antihistamine and a decongestant. Other common combinations include mucus thinning agents, anti-cough agents, ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''). They help to simplify dosing and often will work either together for even more benefit or have counteracting side effects that eliminate or reduce total side effects.''There are some combination nasal preparations available as well to target the tissue of the nose. The combination of azelastine and fluticasone (''Dymista'') combines a nasal antihistamine and steroid to help provide relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms.'   beclomethasone (Beconase, Beconase AQ, Vancenase, Vancenase AQ) flunisolide (Nasarel, Nasalide) budesonide (Rhinocort) fluticasone propionate (Flonase) mometasone furoate (Nasonex) fluticasone furoate (Veramyst) triamcinolone (Nasacort) ciclesonide (Omnaris, Zetonna) acetonide (Tri-Nasal) Sedating, or first generation, for example, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), clemastine (Tavist). Sedating antihistamines should be avoided in those patients who need to drive or use dangerous equipment. Non-sedating or second generation, for example, loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec),fexofenadine (Allegra). Non-sedating antihistamines can have serious drug interactions. Most of these are found over the counter. oxymetazoline (Afrin, Dristan) phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine)"
What can be used to treat non-allergic rhinitis?,"'Treatment of non-allergic rhinitis is similar to the treatment of allergic rhinitis.''Steroid nasal sprays and nasal antihistamines, for example, azelastine (Astelin) as described in more detail in the previous section, are the mainstay of therapy for non-allergic rhinitis. Combination therapy using steroid nasal spray and nasal antihistamine has been shown to be more beneficial.''The other therapies, such as ipratropium (Atrovent) and decongestants, also may be used in patients who continue to have symptoms despite proper therapy with nasal steroids and nasal antihistamines.' "
Does salt water or nasal irrigation have any role in the treatment of rhinitis and post-nasal drip?,"'Irrigating the nose with salt water is a home remedy that is very useful therapy for non-allergic rhinitis, and especially beneficial for treatment and relief of post-nasal drip.''Nasal irrigation'' utilizing a buffered isotonic saline solution (salt water) helps to reduce swollen and congested nasal and sinus tissues. In addition, it washes out thickened nasal secretions, irritants (smog, pollens, etc.), bacteria, and crusts from the nose and sinuses. Non-prescription nasal sprays (Ocean spray, Ayr, Nasal) can be used frequently and are very convenient to use.' Nasal irrigation can be done several times per day. Nasal irrigation is frequently performed with a syringe, a Waterpik device (the attachment is purchased separately), or a Neti pot. The irrigating solution can be made by adding two to three heaping teaspoons of non-iodized (does not sting) salt to one pint of room-temperature distilled water. It is best to use Morton Coarse Kosher Salt or Springfield plain salt because table salt may have unwanted additives. To this solution, add one teaspoon of baking soda. Store at room temperature, and always mix the solution before each use. If the solution stings, use less salt. In the beginning, or for children, it is best to start with a weaker salt mixture. It is not unusual to initially have a mild burning sensation the first few times you irrigate. While irrigating the nose, it is best to stand over the sink and irrigate each side of your nose separately. Aim the stream toward the back of your head, not at the top of your head. For young children, the salt water can be put into a small spray container, which can be squirted many times into each side of the nose."
What are other options for the treatment of rhinitis and post-nasal drip?,"'Treatment can also be directed toward specific causes of rhinitis and post-nasal drip as outlined below.''Treatment of infection''The most common nasal infection is a viral infection known as ""the ''common cold''."" The virus causes swelling of the nasal membranes and production of thick clear mucus. Symptoms usually last several days. If ""a cold"" goes on for many days and is associated with yellow or green drainage, a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Very few patients with a ''common cold'' from a virus will go on to have acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from sinus blockage and impaired sinus function. Sinus blockage can lead to acute ''sinusitis'' (less than 4 weeks in duration) or chronic sinusitis (lasting 12 weeks with continuous symptoms), which can be characterized by nasal congestion, thick mucus, and facial or dental ''pain''. From 4 to 12 weeks, the symptoms are classified as subacute sinusitis or recurrent acute sinusitis.''Symptomatic treatment often involves ''pain'' relief, decongestants, mucous thinning medications, saline rinses, and antihistamine therapy.''Reflux Medications''For rhinitis that is a result of acid reflux disease, antacids (''Maalox'', ''Mylanta'') can help to neutralize acid contents, whereas other medications such as ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''), ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''), ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium'') can decrease stomach acid production. Non-pharmacological treatments include avoiding late evening meals and snacks and eliminating ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine''. Elevating the head of the bed may help decrease reflux during ''sleep''.''Structural problems with the nose and sinuses may ultimately require surgical correction to cure them. This should be done only after more conservative measures have been tried and failed. Septal deviation, septal spurs, septal perforation, enlargement of the turbinates, and nasal/sinus polyps can lead to pooling of or overproduction of secretions, blockage of the normal pathways leading to chronic sinusitis, and chronic irritation. An ear-nose-throat doctor (otolaryngologist) performs the surgery. Surgery can also enhance the delivery of nasal medications and rinses into the nasal ''cavities''.' "
What is post-polio syndrome?,'Post-''polio'' syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors years after recovery from an initial acute attack of the poliomyelitis virus. Post-polio syndrome is mainly characterized by new weakening in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection and in muscles that seemingly were unaffected. ' 
What are the symptoms of post-polio syndrome?,"'Symptoms include slowly progressive muscle ''weakness'', unaccustomed ''fatigue'' (both generalized and muscular), and, at times, muscle atrophy. ''Pain'' from joint degeneration and increasing skeletal deformities such as ''scoliosis'' are common. Some patients experience only minor symptoms. While less common, others may develop visible muscle atrophy, or wasting.''Post-polio syndrome is rarely life-threatening. However, untreated respiratory muscle weakness can result in underventilation, and weakness in swallowing muscles can result in aspiration ''pneumonia''. ''The severity of residual weakness and disability after acute poliomyelitis tends to predict the development of post-polio syndrome. Patients who had minimal symptoms from the original illness will most likely experience only mild post-polio syndrome symptoms. People originally hit hard by the poliovirus and who attained a greater recovery may develop a more severe case of post-polio syndrome with a greater loss of muscle function and more severe ''fatigue''. It should be noted that many polio survivors were too young to remember the severity of their original illness and that accurate memory fades over time. ''According to estimates by the National Center for Health Statistics, more than 440,000 polio survivors in the United States may be at risk for post-polio syndrome. Researchers are unable to establish a firm prevalence rate, but they estimate that the condition affects 25 percent to 50 percent of these survivors, or possibly as many as 60 percent, depending on how the disorder is defined and which study is quoted. ''Patients diagnosed with post-polio syndrome sometimes are concerned that they are having polio again and are ''contagious'' to others. Studies have shown that this does not happen. '  "
What causes post-polio syndrome?,"'The cause is unknown. However, the new weakness of post-polio syndrome appears to be related to the degeneration of individual nerve terminals in the motor units that remain after the initial illness. A motor unit is a nerve cell (or neuron) and the muscle fibers it activates. The poliovirus attacks specific neurons in the brainstem and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. In an effort to compensate for the loss of these neurons, ones that survive sprout new nerve terminals to the orphaned muscle fibers. The result is some recovery of movement and enlarged motor units.''Years of high use of these enlarged motor units adds ''stress'"" to the neuronal cell body, which then may not be able to maintain the metabolic demands of all the new sprouts, resulting in the slow deterioration of motor units. Restoration of nerve function may occur in some fibers a second time, but eventually nerve terminals malfunction and permanent weakness occurs. This hypothesis is consistent with post-polio syndrome's slow, stepwise, unpredictable course. ""'Through years of studies, scientists at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' and at other institutions have shown that the weakness of post-polio syndrome is a very slowly progressing condition marked by periods of stability followed by new declines in the ability to carry out usual daily activities. ' "
How is post-polio syndrome diagnosed?,"'Physicians arrive at a diagnosis of post-polio syndrome by completing a comprehensive medical history and neuromuscular examination and by excluding other disorders that could explain the symptoms. Researchers and physicians typically use the following criteria to establish a diagnosis: ''Criteria for diagnosis of post-polio syndrome*''*Modified from: Post-Polio Syndrome: Identifying Best Practices in Diagnosis & Care. March of Dimes, 2001. ''Post-polio syndrome may be difficult to diagnose in some people because other medical conditions can complicate the evaluation. ''Depression'', for example, also is associated with fatigue and can be misinterpreted as post-polio syndrome or vice versa. For this reason, some clinicians use less restrictive diagnostic criteria, while others prefer to categorize new problems as the late effects of polio—for example, shoulder ''osteoarthritis'' from ''walking'' with crutches, a chronic ''rotator cuff tear'' leading to ''pain'' and disuse weakness, or breathing insufficiency due to progressive scoliosis. ''Polio survivors with post-polio syndrome symptoms need to visit a physician trained in neuromuscular disorders to clearly establish potential causes for declining strength and to assess progression of weakness not explained by other health problems. ''Physicians may use ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), computed tomography (CT), neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies as tools to investigate the course of decline in muscle strength. Less commonly, they will conduct a muscle biopsy or a spinal fluid analysis. These tests are also important to exclude other, possibly treatable, conditions that mimic post-polio syndrome, but the tests do not identify survivors at greatest risk for new progression of muscle weakness. ''It is important to remember that polio survivors may acquire other illnesses and should always have regular check-ups and preventive diagnostic tests, such as mammograms, pap smears, and ''colorectal'' exams. ' Prior paralytic poliomyelitis with evidence ofmotor neuron loss, as confirmed by history of the acute paralytic illness, signs of residual weakness and atrophy of muscles on neuromuscular examination, and signs of nerve damage on electromyography (EMG). Rarely, persons have subclinical paralytic polio, described as a loss of motor neurons during acute polio but with no obvious deficit. That prior polio now needs to be confirmed with an EMG. Also, a reported history of nonparalytic polio may be inaccurate.  A period of partial or complete functional recovery after acute paralytic poliomyelitis, followed by an interval (usually 15 years or more) of stable neuromuscular function.  Gradual onset of progressive and persistent new muscle weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability (decreased endurance), with or without generalized fatigue, muscle atrophy, or muscle and joint pain. Onset may at times follow trauma, surgery, or a period of inactivity, and can appear to be sudden. Less commonly, symptoms attributed to post-polio syndrome include new problems with breathing or swallowing. Symptoms that persist for at least a year.  Exclusion of other neuromuscular, medical, and orthopedic problems as causes of symptoms. "
How is post-polio syndrome treated?,"'There are currently no effective pharmaceutical or specific treatments for the syndrome itself. However, a number of controlled studies have demonstrated that nonfatiguing exercises can improve muscle strength. ''Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have tried treating post-polio syndrome patients with alpha-2 recombinant ''interferon'', but the treatment proved ineffective. Another study in which post-polio syndrome patients received high doses of ''prednisone'"" demonstrated a mild improvement in their condition, but the results were not statistically significant. This, in addition to the drug's side effects, led researchers to recommend that prednisone not be used to treat post-polio syndrome.""'In an effort to reduce fatigue, increase strength, and improve quality of life in post-polio syndrome patients, scientists conducted two controlled studies using low doses of the drug ''pyridostigmine'' (''Mestinon''). These studies showed that pyridostigmine is not helpful for post-polio syndrome patients. ''In another controlled study scientists concluded that the drug ''amantadine'' (Symmetrel) is not helpful in reducing fatigue. And other researchers recently evaluated the effectiveness of ''modafinil'' (''Provigil'') on reducing fatigue and found no benefit.''Preliminary studies indicate that intravenous immunoglobin may reduce pain, increase quality of life, and improve strength. Research into its use is ongoing. ''The future of post-polio syndrome treatment may center on nerve growth factors. Since post-polio syndrome may result from the degeneration of nerve sprouts, growth factors can target these and help to regenerate new ones. Unfortunately, one small study that NINDS scientists participated in showed that ''insulin''-like growth factor (IGF-1), which can enhance the ability of motor neurons to sprout new branches and maintain existing branches, was not helpful. ''Although there is no cure, there are recommended management strategies. Seek medical advice from a physician experienced in treating neuromuscular disorders. Do not attribute all signs and symptoms to prior polio. Use judicious ''exercise'', preferably under the supervision of an experienced professional. Use recommended mobility aids, ventilatory equipment, and revised activities of daily living. Avoid activities that cause pain or fatigue that lasts more than 10 minutes. Pace daily activities to avoid rapid muscle tiring and total body exhaustion.''Learning about post-polio syndrome is important for polio survivors and their families. Management of post-polio syndrome can involve lifestyle changes. Support groups that encourage self-help, group participation, and positive action can be helpful. For some, individual or family counseling may be needed to adjust to the late effects of poliomyelitis, because experiencing new symptoms and using assistive devices may bring back distressing memories of the original illness.

What is the role of exercise in the treatment of post-polio syndrome?,"'The symptoms of pain, weakness, and fatigue can result from the overuse and misuse of muscles and joints. These same symptoms can also result from disuse of muscles and joints.

Cardiopulmonary endurance training is usually more effective than strengthening exercises. Heavy or intense resistive exercise and weight-lifting using polio-affected muscles may be counterproductive because they can further weaken rather than strengthen these muscles. ''Exercise prescriptions should include''Exercise should be reduced or discontinued if additional weakness, excessive fatigue, or unduly prolonged recovery time is noted by either the individual with post-polio syndrome or the professional monitoring the exercise.

Researchers who discovered inflammation around motor neurons or muscles are trying to find out if this is due to an immunological response.''Other investigators have discovered that fragments of the poliovirus, or mutated versions of it, are in the spinal fluid of some survivors. The significance of this finding is not known and more research is being done. ' "

Facts you should know about postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)," PHN is a painful complication that occurs after a shingles infection. PHN is caused by viral damage to nerve cells. PHN is diagnosed by the patient's history and physical exam. Treatment often requires more than one agent to reduce pain. PHN may last one to two months, but some patients have PHN for longer than a year. Older people and people with relatives who get shingles are at a higher risk for PHN. Complications of PHN may include severe pain, pain-medicine addiction, diminished lifestyle, and in a few patients, paralysis of the affected area. The prognosis of PHN ranges from good to poor, depending on the length of time the disease lingers and on the development of complications. PHN can be prevented in many people by a vaccine designed to prevent shingles (Zostavax)."
What is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)?,"'Postherpetic neuralgia (also termed PHN) is a condition of recurring or persistent ''pain'' in an area of the body that has undergone an outbreak of ''herpes zoster'' virus (HZ), also known as the ''varicella zoster virus'', commonly termed ''shingles''. It usually begins after ''shingles'' lesions (''blisters'') begin to crust over and heal but may occur in some patients who do not produce lesions. Some investigators suggest the pain has to be present for three months to be termed PHN.' "
What causes postherpetic neuralgia?,"'Postherpetic neuralgia is thought to be caused by the damage or alteration of nerves that register pain, pressure, and other sensory nerves (for example, touch) that occur when the reactivated HZ ''viruses'' travel down nerves to the skin. This process first begins when the virus causes ''chickenpox'' in an individual; the ''viruses'' can infect various dorsal root ganglia (nerve cells) as the ''chickenpox'' subsides. These viruses then can be reactivated, usually decades later, and produce ''shingles'' lesions. The reactivation of HZ is thought to be due to a ''stress'' on the body from either another infection or a immunocompromised state (for example, some patients undergoing treatments for ''leukemia'') that allows the HZ to escape the dorsal root cells. PHN does not occur in everyone who gets ''shingles''; about 9%-14% have symptoms after one month post-''shingles'' and about 5% have PHN three months post-shingles. ' "
What are postherpetic neuralgia symptoms and signs?,"'The main symptom is pain. The pain can be severe (allodynia - pain due to a stimulus that does not usually provoke pain); patients describe the pain as burning, sharp, jabbing, deep, and aching. Often, the patient feels increased pain when any pressure, even clothing, touches the area. Some patients describe ''itchy'' skin and ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'' of the area.'  "
What are the risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia?,"'Age is a high risk factor for PHN; the older a person when he or she develops shingles, the more likely it is that the person will develop PHN. People over 60 years of age have about a 60% chance while people 70 or older have about a 75% chance of developing PHN after getting shingles. Another risk factor is family; those people who have close relatives who developed PHN are at a higher risk than people with no family history of PHN. ' "
How is postherpetic neuralgia diagnosed?,"""The majority of patients who are diagnosed with PHN are done by follow-up of a shingles infection or by the patient's history of a recent shingles infection. The pain is located in the same nerve distribution (dermatome) area, usually on only one side of the person's body where the shingles lesions occurred. "" "
What is the treatment for postherpetic neuralgia?,"'Treatment is individualized for each patient; there is no treatment that is effective for all PHN patients, so clinicians often use two or more of the drug categories with examples listed below:''Because some ''drugs'' (opioids) can be addictive and because some patients may need long-term treatments (over one year), consultation with a pain-management specialist may be advised. Some individuals claim tamanu oil rubbed into the affected may reduce the symptoms of PHN. One small study and a few case reports indicate that ''acupuncture'' can be helpful in relieving the pain of PHN. Infrequently, other methods are used. TENS (''transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'"") devices are designed to interrupt the body's pain sensations while ""'nerve blocks'' (short-term chemical nerve sensation blockade) and nerve ablation (surgically cutting a nerve) are also used. Results vary but the methods often do not give lasting pain relief.'   Lidocaine skin patches ([Lidoderm] small, bandage-like patches applied to painful areas) Capsaicin skin patches ([Capsagel, Salonpas] applied in a doctor's office by trained staff) Opioids (tramadol [Ultram], oxycodone [OxyContin], morphine) Anticonvulsants (pregabalin [Lyrica], gabapentin [Neurontin]) have been shown to lessen the pain of PHN probably by stabilizing abnormal electrical activity in your nervous system. Antidepressants (venlafaxine [Effexor], duloxetine [Cymbalta]) are often prescribed in lower doses than for depression."
How long does postherpetic neuralgia last?,"'Only approximately 9%-15% of patients who get shingles develop PHN. For those few patients who develop PHN, the length of time that PHN lasts is variable; the majority of PHN patients have discomfort lasting one to two months. About one-third of PHN patients have symptoms that last about three months, and about one-fifth last a year or longer.' "
What are the complications of postherpetic neuralgia?,"'PHN itself is a complication of shingles. A serious complication of PHN is ''addiction'' to pain medications. Some patients may have an inability to live a normal lifestyle (unable to ''exercise'') because of constant pain, while others have ''sleep'' and activities limited or even prohibited by touching the affected area, including just having contact with their own clothing. Patients taking opioids may become very constipated. In a few cases of PHN, muscle ''weakness'' can be an additional complication.' "
What is the prognosis for postherpetic neuralgia?,"'For the majority of patients who develop PHN, the prognosis is good although they may have to take pain medications for about one to three months. For others, the prognosis is fair to poor if the pain is severe, lasts longer than three months, or markedly reduces their quality of life. PHN occasionally results in permanent nerve damage; however, the disease is not fatal.' "
Is it possible to prevent postherpetic neuralgia?,"'If shingles can be prevented, then PHN can be prevented. Fortunately, the vaccine ''Zostavax'' is about 70% effective in preventing shingles. The CDC recommends that everyone older than 60 years of age get the vaccine; in 2011, the FDA approved the vaccine for people aged 50 and above. The CDC states, ""Zostavax should not be given to ''pregnant'' women, persons with a primary or acquired ''immunodeficiency'', or to persons with a history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin, ''neomycin'', or any other component of the vaccine. ''Herpes'' zoster vaccine can be administered simultaneously with other indicated ''vaccines''.""' "
What are postpartum depression and peripartum depression? Are there different types of peripartum depression?,"'Postpartum depression, now included in the describer of depression with peripartum onset (during pregnancy or within a month after giving birth), may be the most common problem associated with ''childbirth''. It has been described as afflicting prominent historical figures like author/suffragist Charlotte Perkins Gilman in the 19th century. This illness is characterized by depression that a woman experiences either during pregnancy or within four weeks of giving birth, affecting about 3%-6% of women who give birth, up to 20% when only women with postpartum depression, rather than including those who are ''depressed'' during the pregnancy are counted. Peripartum depression, as well as postpartum ''anxiety'', occurs after one out of every eight deliveries in the United States, affecting about half a million women every year. Peripartum depression is also called ''major depression'' with peripartum onset. Delusional thinking after ''childbirth'', called postpartum psychosis, affects about one in every 500 to 1,000 women.''Notably, postpartum depression is not an illness that is exclusive to mothers. Fathers can experience it, as well. As with women, symptoms in men can result in fathers having difficulty caring for themselves and for their children when suffering from postpartum depression.''Unfortunately, up to 50% of individuals with postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis are never detected. That can result in devastating outcomes for the patient and family. For example, postpartum psychosis is thought to have been a potential factor in Andrea Yates ''drowning'' her five children in 2001 and was explored as a factor in Susan Smith drowning her two sons in 1994.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for postpartum depression?,"'Similar to many other ''mental health'' conditions, there is thought to be a genetic vulnerability to developing postpartum depression, in that people who have family members who have had this or any other ''mental illness'' have a higher risk of developing postpartum depression compared with people who have no such family history.''Rapid changes in reproductive hormone levels (like estrogen and ''progesterone'') that occur during pregnancy and after delivery are thought to be biological factors in the development of this condition. People with any history of depression, ''anxiety'', ''alcohol'' or another substance use disorder prior to the pregnancy are at risk for developing depression during the pregnancy or within a few weeks after delivery. Examples of specific illnesses that have been associated with being associated with the potential to develop postpartum depression include any form of major depression, such as ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'', ''bipolar disorder'' and ''generalized anxiety disorder''.''Interestingly, men are also known to experience changes in a number of hormonal changes during the peripartum period that can contribute to the development of PPD. Also, the ''stress'' of any medical complications as a result of the pregnancy or delivery, as well as the ''stress'' that is inherent in caring for a ''newborn'' are considerable factors.''Further risk factors for developing postpartum depression include age younger than 20 years, low self-esteem or life stressors like low socioeconomic status, a lack of having social support before and after the birth of the baby, and marital problems, including any history of intimate partner violence.' "
What are postpartum depression symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of postpartum depression begin either during pregnancy or within four weeks after having a baby and include the following:''Postpartum psychosis occurs much more rarely and is thought to be a severe form of postpartum depression. Symptoms of that disorder include the following:'  Feelings of profound sadness, emptiness, emotional numbness, irritability, or anger. A tendency to withdraw from relationships with family, friends, or from activities that are usually pleasurable for the PPD sufferer Constant fatigue or tiredness, difficulty sleeping, overeating, or loss of appetite A strong sense of failure or inadequacy Intense concern and anxiety about the baby or a lack of interest in the baby Thoughts about suicide or fears of harming the baby Delusions (false beliefs) Hallucinations (for example, hearing voices or seeing things that are not real) Suicidal thoughts Thoughts of harming the baby Severe depressive symptoms"
What tests to doctors use to diagnose postpartum depression?,"""There is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has PPD. Therefore, health care providers diagnose this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health history. Patients tend to benefit when the health care provider takes into account their client's entire life and background. This includes, but is not limited to, the person's gender, sexual orientation, cultural, religious, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and as part of screening the individual for medical conditions that might contribute to mental health symptoms.""'Postpartum depression must be distinguished from what is commonly called the postpartum blues or ""baby blues,"" which tend to occur in most new mothers. In the brief mood problem of baby blues, symptoms like crying, sadness, irritability, ''anxiety'', and ''confusion'"" can occur. In contrast to the symptoms of PPD, the symptoms of the baby blues tend to occur within a few days postpartum, peaking around the fourth day after delivery, resolve by the tenth day and do not tend to affect the individual's ability to function.""'Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that requires immediate intervention because of the danger that the sufferer might kill their baby or themselves. Postpartum psychosis usually begins within the first two weeks after delivery. Symptoms of this disorder tend to involve extremely disorganized thinking, bizarre behavior, unusual hallucinations, and delusions. Postpartum psychosis is often a symptom of ''bipolar disorder'', previously called ''manic'' depression.' "
What are the treatments for postpartum depression?,"'Treatment of postpartum depression in men and women is similar. Both mothers and fathers with this condition have been found to greatly benefit from being educated about the illness, as well as from the support of other parents who have been in this position.''Psychotherapies''Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") involves working with a trained therapist to determine methods to solve problems and cope with all forms of depression, including postpartum depression. It can be a powerful intervention and may produce, positive biochemical changes in the brain. This is a particularly important alternative to treatment with medication in women who are breastfeeding. In general, these therapies take weeks to months to complete. More intense counseling may be needed for longer when treating very severe depression or other psychiatric symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy'' (IPT): This helps to alleviate depressive symptoms and helps the person with PPD develop more effective skills for coping with social and interpersonal relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals.''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT''): This helps to alleviate depression and reduce the likelihood it will return by helping the PPD sufferer change his or her way of thinking. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals.''Medication therapy for postpartum depression usually involves the use of an ''antidepressant'' medication. The major types of antidepressant medication are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine/''dopamine'' reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs), the ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs), and the ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs'""). SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group. People with depression or anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum (the two together being known as the perinatal period) should consult with their doctor about safety issues for the developing fetus then the new baby. That issue should also be addressed with the baby's pediatrician for ""'babies'' who receive ''breast milk''. Examples of ''antidepressants'' are listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.''SSRIs''SNRIs and NDRs:''TCAs are sometimes prescribed in severe cases of depression or when SSRIs or SNRIs are ineffective. These medications affect a number of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters), especially epinephrine and norepinephrine (also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively). Examples include''About two-thirds of people who take antidepressant medications improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to notice mood improvement. It is, therefore, important not to stop taking the medication because benefits may not be seen immediately. The MAOIs are not often used since the introduction of the SSRIs. Because of the possibility of interactions, the MAOIs may not be taken with many other types of medication, and some types of foods that are high in tyramine (like aged cheeses, wines, and cured meats) must be avoided as well. Examples of MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Atypical neuroleptic medications are often prescribed in addition to a mood-stabilizer medication in people with severe postpartum depression or who have postpartum psychosis. Examples of atypical neuroleptics include''Non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications are also sometimes used with a neuroleptic medication to treat people with postpartum psychosis because ''bipolar disorder'' may also be present in some patients. Examples of non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include''Electroconvulsive therapy''Electroconvulsive therapy (''ECT''), previously called electroshock therapy or ''shock'' treatment, is a therapy that addresses severe psychiatric symptoms. It involves inducing ''seizures'"" in people by placing electrodes on the person's head, usually on what corresponds to one side of the brain. The treatment occurs while the person is fully sedated to avoid any distress associated with having ""'seizures''. Health care professionals administer treatments up to three times per week for at least one week, continuing until symptoms have significantly improved. Side effects usually include confusion and ''memory loss'' immediately after the procedure, the latter of which may take weeks to resolve.''Also effective in treating many people with severe depression, psychosis, and the ''mood swings'' associated with ''manic depressive'' (bipolar disorder) episodes in general, ECT is effective in treating postpartum psychosis and severe forms of postpartum depression. In fact, there is research that indicates higher response of people with depression or psychosis during the postpartum period compared with those symptoms outside of the postpartum period'  The first is education about the nature of depression. The therapist will emphasize that depression is a common illness and that most people can expect to get better with treatment. The second is defining specific problems (such as child care pressures or interpersonal conflicts). After the problems are defined, the therapist is able to help set realistic goals for solving these problems. Together, the individual with PPD and his or her therapist will use various treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote cooperation. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the person with PPD to being depressed. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the individual with PPD more effective strategies for dealing with problems.

What is the prognosis of postpartum depression?,"'Women who have suffered from postpartum depression are much more likely to have depression again sometime in the future. They are also at risk for poor ''diet'' and low compliance with medical recommendations, as well as having more financial problems, being the victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as for developing tobacco or other ''substance abuse''. Children of mothers with PPD are at risk for medical emotional challenges as a result of problematic relationships with their mother and of receiving compromised care from their mother.' "
Is it possible to prevent postpartum depression?,"'Intensive nursing intervention in the form of visits to new mothers by a nurse can help prevent the development of postpartum depression. Screening women before they become ''pregnant'' (pre-pregnancy), screening parents for the early signs, and gathering history about any family members who have suffered from depression, anxiety, or any other mental health problem are other important tools for preventing the progression of minor symptoms to a full-blown illness.'

Facts you should know about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)," Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an emotional illness that doctors first formally diagnosed in soldiers and war veterans and is usually caused by terribly frightening, life-threatening, or otherwise highly unsafe experiences but can also be caused by devastating life events like unemployment or divorce. PTSD symptom types include re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. PTSD affects 8 million adults in any one year. Girls, women, and ethnic minorities develop PTSD more than boys, men, and Caucasians. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) usually results from prolonged exposure to traumatic event(s), and long-lasting problems that affect many aspects of emotional and social functioning characterize PTSD. Symptoms of C-PTSD include problems regulating feelings, dissociation, or depersonalization, persistent depressive feelings, seeing the perpetrator of trauma as all powerful, preoccupation with the perpetrator, and a severe change in what gives the sufferer meaning. Untreated PTSD can have devastating, far-reaching consequences for sufferers' medical, emotional, and vocational functioning and relationships, their families, and for society. Children with PTSD can experience significantly negative effects on their social and emotional development, as well as their ability to learn. Although almost any event that is life threatening or that severely compromises the emotional well-being of an individual may cause PTSD, such events usually include experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, getting a frightening medical diagnosis, being the victim of a crime or torture, exposure to combat, disaster, or terrorist attack, enduring any form of abuse, or involvement in civil conflict. Issues that tend to put people at higher risk for developing PTSD include female gender, minority status, increased duration or severity of, as well as exposure to, the trauma experienced, having an emotional condition prior to the event, and having little social support. Risk factors for children and adolescents also include having any learning disability or experiencing violence in the home. Disaster preparedness training may be a protective factor for PTSD as can rapid intervention and certain personal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. Medicines that treat depression (for example, serotonergic antidepressants or SSRIs) or that decrease the heart rate (for example, propranolol) are thought to be effective tools in the prevention of PTSD when given in the days immediately after an individual experiences a traumatic event. SSRIs seem to be most effective in treating people whose PTSD is the result of noncombat-related trauma. Individuals who wonder if they may be suffering from PTSD may benefit from taking a self-test as they consider meeting with a health care professional. Professionals may use a clinical interview in adults, children, or adolescents, or one of a number of structured tests with children or adolescents to assess for the presence of this illness. Diagnosing PTSD can present a challenge for professionals since sufferers often come for evaluation of something that seems to be unrelated to that illness at first. Those symptoms tend to be physical complaints, depression, or substance abuse. Also, PTSD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders, manic depression, or with eating disorders. Challenges for the assessment of PTSD in children and adolescents include an adult caretakers' tendency to be unaware of the extent of the young person's symptoms and the tendency for children and teens to express symptoms of the illness in ways that are quite different from adults. Treatments for PTSD usually include psychological and medical treatments. Education about the illness, helping the individual talk about the trauma directly, exploration and modification of inaccurate ways of thinking about it, and teaching the person ways to manage symptoms and are the usual techniques used in psychotherapy. Family and couples' counseling, parenting classes, and education about conflict resolution are other useful psychotherapeutic interventions. Directly addressing the sleep problems associated with PTSD helps alleviate those problems, thereby decreasing the symptoms of PTSD in general. Medications that help PTSD sufferers include serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) and medicines that help decrease the physical symptoms associated with illness. Other potentially helpful medications for managing PTSD include mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Tranquilizers have been associated with withdrawal symptoms and other problems and are not significantly effective for helping individuals with PTSD. Some ways that are often suggested for PTSD patients to cope with this illness include learning more about the illness, occupational therapy including service dog therapy, talking to others for support, using relaxation techniques, participating in treatment, increasing positive lifestyle practices, and minimizing negative lifestyle practices."
What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?,"'Post-traumatic ''stress'' disorder (PTSD) is an emotional illness classified as a trauma- and stressor-related disorder as of the most recent edition of the diagnostic reference for ''mental health'' disorders, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'' or ''DSM-V''). Prior to this most recent edition, PTSD was classified as an ''anxiety disorder'' in the ''DSM-4'' (''DSM-IV''). This condition usually develops because of a terribly frightening, life-threatening, or otherwise highly unsafe experience. PTSD sufferers re-experience the traumatic event or events in some way, tend to avoid places, people, or other things that remind them of the event (avoidance), and are exquisitely sensitive to normal life experiences (hyperarousal). Although this condition has likely existed since human beings have endured trauma, PTSD has only been recognized as a formal diagnosis since 1980. However, it was called by different names as early as the American Civil War, when combat veterans were referred to as suffering from ""soldier\'s heart."" In World War I, the military referred to symptoms that were generally consistent with this syndrome as ""combat ''fatigue''."" Soldiers who developed such symptoms in World War II were said to be suffering from ""gross ''stress'' reaction,"" and many troops in Vietnam who had symptoms of what is now called PTSD were assessed as having ""post-Vietnam syndrome."" ""Battle ''fatigue''"" and ""shell ''shock''"" are other names for PTSD.''Although not specifically described in the ''DSM-5'', complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is recognized in the international manual for diseases, called the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). It usually results from prolonged exposure to a traumatic event or series thereof and is characterized by long-lasting problems with many aspects of emotional and social functioning. Compared to people who suffer from PTSD, those who have C-PTSD are at higher risk of engaging in self-harm, including ''suicide'' attempts and completion.''Statistics regarding this illness indicate that a low percentage of people in the United States will likely develop PTSD in their lifetime. Combat veterans and ''rape'' victims have a lifetime prevalence of PTSD. Somewhat higher rates of this disorder occur in African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans compared to Caucasians in the United States. Some of those differences are thought to be due to higher rates of dissociation soon before and after the traumatic event (peritraumatic), a tendency for individuals from minority ethnic groups to blame themselves, have less social support, and an increased exposure to racism for those ethnic groups, as well as differences between how ethnic groups may express distress. In military populations, many of the differences have been found to be the result of increased exposure to combat at younger ages for minority groups. Other important facts about PTSD include the estimate of 8 million people who suffer from PTSD at any one time in the United States and the fact that women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD.''Almost half of individuals who use outpatient mental health services suffer from PTSD. As evidenced by the occurrence of stress in many individuals in the United States in the days following the 2001 terrorist attacks, not being physically present at a traumatic event does not guarantee that one will not suffer from traumatic stress that can lead to the development of PTSD.''PTSD statistics in children and teens reveal that up to 40% have endured at least one traumatic event, resulting in the development of PTSD in up to 15% of girls and 6% of boys. On average, 3%-6% of high school students in the United States and as many as 30%-60% of children who have survived specific disasters have PTSD. Most children who have seen a parent killed or endured sexual assault or abuse tend to develop PTSD, and more than one-third of youths who are exposed to community violence (for example, a shooting, stabbing, or other assault) will suffer from the disorder.' "
What are the effects of PTSD?,"'Although not all traumatized individuals develop PTSD, there can be significant physical consequences of being traumatized. For example, research indicates that people who have been exposed to an extreme stressor sometimes have a smaller hippocampus (a region of the brain that plays a role in memory) than people who have not been exposed to trauma. This is significant in understanding the effects of trauma in general and the impact of PTSD, specifically since the hippocampus is the part of the brain thought to have an important role in developing new memories about life events. Also, whether or not a traumatized person goes on to develop PTSD, they seem to be at risk for higher use of cigarettes, ''alcohol'', and ''marijuana''. Conversely, people whose PTSD is treated also tend to have better success at overcoming a substance-abuse problem.'""Untreated PTSD can have devastating, far-reaching consequences for sufferers' functioning and relationships, their families, and for society. Complications of PTSD in women who are ""'pregnant'' include having other emotional problems, poor health behaviors, and memory problems. Women who suffered sexual abuse at earlier ages are more likely to develop complex PTSD and ''borderline personality disorder''. ''Babies'' who are born to mothers who suffer from this illness during ''pregnancy'' are more likely to experience a change in at least one chemical in their body that makes it more likely (predisposes) the baby to develop PTSD later in life. Individuals who suffer from this illness are at risk of having more health problems, as well as trouble reproducing. Examples of the physical health problems that PTSD sufferers are at higher risk of developing include ''arthritis'', ''heart disease'', and respiratory, as well as digestive problems.''Emotionally, PTSD sufferers may struggle more to achieve as good an outcome from mental health treatment as that of people with other emotional problems. In children and teens, PTSD can have significantly negative effects on their social and emotional development, as well as on their ability to learn.''Economically, PTSD can have significant consequences, as well. As of 2017, more than 900,000 veterans were receiving disability compensation for this illness, at a cost of $15 billion. This represents a 400% increase in the number of military people receiving disability benefits for PTSD since 2005.' "
What causes PTSD?,"'Virtually any trauma, defined as an event that is life threatening or that severely compromises the physical or emotional well-being of an individual or causes intense fear, may cause PTSD. Such events often include either experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis, being the victim of kidnapping or torture, exposure to community violence, war combat, or to a natural disaster, exposure to other disaster (for example, plane crash) or terrorist attack, being the victim of rape, mugging, robbery, or assault, enduring physical, sexual, emotional, or other forms of abuse, as well as involvement in civil conflict. Although the diagnosis of PTSD currently requires that the sufferer has a history of experiencing a traumatic event as defined here, people may develop PTSD in reaction to events that may not qualify as traumatic but can be devastating life events like divorce or unemployment.'

What are PTSD risk factors and protective factors?,"'Issues that tend to put people at higher risk for developing PTSD include increased duration of a traumatic event, higher number of traumatic events endured, higher severity of the trauma experienced, having an emotional condition prior to the event, or having little social support in the form of family or friends. In addition to those risk factors, children and adolescents, females, minority groups and people with ''learning disabilities'' or violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event.' "
What are PTSD symptoms and signs?,"'According to the ''DSM-5'', the following three groups of symptom criteria are required to assign the diagnosis of PTSD in the context of an individual who has a history of being exposed to an actual or perceived threat of death, serious injury, or sexual violence to self or others that does not involve exposure through media unless that is work related:''The emotional numbing of PTSD may present as a lack of interest in activities that used to be enjoyed (anhedonia), emotional deadness, distancing oneself from people, and/or a sense of a foreshortened future (for example, not being able to think about the future or make future plans, not believing one will live much longer). At least one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance symptom, two negative changes in mood or thinking, and two hyperarousal (fight or flight) symptoms must be present for at least one month and must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning in order for the diagnosis of PTSD to be assigned.''A similar disorder in terms of symptom repertoire is ''acute stress disorder''. The major differences between the two disorders are that acute stress disorder symptoms persist from three days to one month after the trauma exposure, and a fewer number of traumatic symptoms are required to make the diagnosis as compared to PTSD.''In children, re-experiencing the trauma may occur through repeated play that has trauma-related themes instead of or in addition to memories, and distressing dreams may have more general content rather than of the traumatic event itself. As in adults, at least one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance/numbing symptom, and two hyperarousal symptoms must be present for at least one month and must cause significant distress or functional impairment in order for the diagnosis of PTSD to be assigned. When symptoms have been present for three days to one month, a health care provider can then make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder (''ASD'').''Symptoms of PTSD that tend to be associated with C-PTSD include problems regulating feelings, which can result in ''suicidal thoughts'"", explosive anger, or passive aggressive behaviors, a tendency to forget the trauma or feel detached from one's life (dissociation) or body (depersonalization), persistent feelings of helplessness, shame, guilt, or being completely different from others, feeling the perpetrator of trauma is all powerful, and preoccupation with either revenge against or allegiance with the perpetrator, and severe change in those things that give the sufferer meaning, like a loss of spiritual faith or an ongoing sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or despair.""   Recurrent re-experiencing of the trauma (for example, troublesome memories, flashbacks usually caused by reminders of the traumatic events, recurring nightmares about the trauma and/or dissociative reliving of the trauma): In children, this may include repetitive play about the trauma. Avoidance to the point of having a phobia of places, people, and experiences that remind the sufferer of the trauma, or a general numbing of emotional responsiveness Negative changes in thinking and trouble remembering important aspects of the trauma, holding negative beliefs about him or herself, a tendency to blame oneself for the trauma, a persistently negative emotional state, inability to have positive emotions, low interest or participation in significant activities, and feeling detached from others Significant changes in arousal and reactivity related to the traumatic event(s), including sleep problems, trouble concentrating, irritability, anger, poor concentration, blackouts or difficulty remembering things, reckless or self-destructive behavior, increased tendency and reaction to being startled, and hypervigilance (excessive watchfulness) to threat"
How do health care professionals assess PTSD?,"""For individuals who may be wondering if they should seek evaluation for PTSD by their medical or mental health professional, self-tests may be useful. The National Institute of Mental Health offers a self-test for PTSD. The assessment of PTSD can be difficult for practitioners to make since sufferers often come to the professional's office complaining of symptoms other than ""'anxiety'' associated with a traumatic experience. Those symptoms tend to include body symptoms (somatization), ''depression'', or ''drug addiction''. Studies of Iraq war veterans indicate that these individuals tend to show more physical symptoms of PTSD as opposed to describing the associated emotional problems.''Many people with PTSD may present with a history of making ''suicide'' attempts. In addition to depression and substance-use disorders, the diagnosis of PTSD often co-occurs (is comorbid) with ''bipolar disorder'' (manic depression), eating disorders, and other ''anxiety'' disorders like ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''), ''panic disorder'', ''social anxiety disorder'', and ''generalized anxiety disorder''.'""Most health care professionals who examine a child or teenager for PTSD will interview both the parent and the child, usually separately, in order to allow each party to speak freely. Interviewing the child in addition to the adults in his or her life is quite important given that while the child or adolescent's parent or guardian may have a unique perspective, there are naturally things the young person may be thinking, feeling, or doing that the adult is not aware of. Another challenge for diagnosing PTSD in children, particularly in younger children, is that they may express their symptoms differently from adults. For example, symptoms in children may include the child going backward or regressing in their development, becoming accident prone, engaging in risky behaviors, becoming clingy, or suffering from more physical complaints as compared to adults with PTSD. Traumatized younger children may also have trouble sitting still, focusing, or managing their impulses and therefore be mistaken as suffering from ""'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').''Sometimes, professionals will use a rating scale or a structured psychiatric interview for children in its entirety or just the portion that assesses PTSD in order to test for PTSD. Examples of such tools include the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV (DISC-IV), and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and ''Schizophrenia'' for School Age Children (K-SADS). There are also some PTSD-specific structured interviews, like the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-Child and Adolescent Version, the Child PTSD Checklist, and the Child PTSD Symptom Scale. For the assessment of the severity of PTSD symptoms in children, structured interviews like the Child Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Index, the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey, and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children are sometimes used. Some professionals find the Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire useful in predicting which children who endure a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD.' "
What is the treatment for PTSD?,"'Treatments for PTSD usually include trauma-focused psychological and medical interventions. Providing information about the illness, helping the individual manage the trauma by talking about it directly, teaching the person ways to manage symptoms of PTSD, and exploration and modification of inaccurate ways of thinking about the trauma are the usual techniques used in psychotherapy for this illness. Education of PTSD sufferers usually involves teaching individuals about what PTSD is, how many others suffer from the same illness, that extraordinary stress causes PTSD rather than personal ''weakness'', how it is treated, and what to expect in treatment. This education thereby increases the likelihood that inaccurate ideas the person may have about the illness are dispelled, and any shame they may feel about having it is minimized. This may be particularly important in populations like military personnel that may feel particularly stigmatized by the idea of seeing a mental health professional and therefore avoid doing so.''Teaching people with PTSD practical approaches to coping with what can be very intense and disturbing symptoms is a useful way to treat the illness. Specifically, helping sufferers learn how to manage their anger and ''anxiety'', improve their communication skills, and use ''breathing'' and other relaxation techniques can help individuals with PTSD gain a sense of mastery over their emotional and physical symptoms. The health care professional might also use exposure-based ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' by having the person with PTSD recall their traumatic experiences using images or verbal recall while using the coping mechanisms they learned. Individual or group cognitive behavioral psychotherapy can help people with PTSD recognize and adjust trauma-related thoughts and beliefs by educating sufferers about the relationships between thoughts and feelings, exploring common negative thoughts held by traumatized individuals, developing alternative interpretations, and by practicing new ways of looking at things. This treatment also involves practicing learned techniques in real-life situations. Intensive exposure therapy, which often involves multiple extensive sessions over several days followed by several weekly sessions over six months or more, is an evidence-based treatment that has been found to help people who have chronic PTSD. The Veterans Administration has invested in expanding the availability of this treatment to the people it serves.''Eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (''EMDR'"") is a form of cognitive therapy in which the health care professional guides the person with PTSD in talking about the trauma suffered and the negative feelings associated with the events, while focusing on the professional's rapidly moving finger during one-on-one treatment sessions. While some research indicates this treatment may be effective, it is unclear if this is any more effective than cognitive therapy done without the use of rapid eye movement.""'Helping PTSD sufferers maintain their employment and other tasks of their daily lives is an important part of treatment. Occupational therapy (OT) is an important treatment modality in that regard, in that it focuses on rehabilitation and recovery through participation in activities. This can range from assisting helping people with PTSD regain independence in basic self-care to helping them reintegrate into previously held work and community roles. Another potentially powerfully positive activity-based intervention for individuals with PTSD can be the use of a service dog. Particularly toward the completion of more conventional treatments, service ''dogs'"" have been found to be effective in improving PTSD suffers' sense of safety, responsibility, optimism, and self-awareness.""'Families of PTSD individuals, as well as the sufferer, may benefit from family counseling, couples counseling, parenting classes, and conflict-resolution education. Family members may also be able to provide relevant history about their loved one (for example, about emotions and behaviors, ''drug abuse'', sleeping habits, and socialization) that people with the illness are unable or unwilling to share.''Directly addressing the ''sleep'' problems that can be part of PTSD not only helps alleviate those problems but thereby helps decrease the symptoms of PTSD in general. Specifically, rehearsing adaptive ways of coping with nightmares (imagery rehearsal therapy), training in relaxation techniques, positive self-talk, and screening for other sleep problems can be helpful in decreasing the sleep problems associated with PTSD.''Medications that help PTSD sufferers include serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs), like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), and ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), and medicines that help decrease the physical symptoms associated with illness, like ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres''), ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex''), and propranolol. Individuals with PTSD are much less likely to experience a relapse of their illness if the person continues ''antidepressant'' treatment for at least a year. SSRIs are the first group of medications that have received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PTSD. Treatment guidelines provided by the American Psychiatric Association describe these medicines as being particularly helpful for people whose PTSD is the result of trauma that is not combat related. SSRIs tend to help PTSD sufferers modify information that is taken in from the environment (stimuli) and to decrease fear. Research also shows that this group of medicines tends to decrease anxiety, depression, and panic. SSRIs may also help reduce aggression, ''impulsivity'', and ''suicidal'' thoughts that can be associated with this disorder. For combat-related PTSD, there is more and more evidence that prazosin can be particularly helpful. Although other medications like ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), and ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq'') sometimes treat PTSD, little research has studied their effectiveness in treating this illness.''Other less directly effective but nevertheless potentially helpful medications for managing PTSD include mood stabilizers like ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''), ''tiagabine'' (''Gabitril''), and ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), as well as mood stabilizers that are also antipsychotics, like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), asenapine (Saphris), and paliperidone (Invega). Antipsychotic medicines seem to be most useful in the treatment of PTSD in those who suffer from agitation, dissociation, hypervigilance, intense suspiciousness (''paranoia''), or brief breaks in being in touch with reality (brief psychotic reactions). The antipsychotic medications are helpful treatment options for managing PTSD when used in combination with an SSRI.''Benzodiazepines'' (tranquilizers) such as ''diazepam'' (''Valium'') and ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax'') have unfortunately been associated with a number of problems, including withdrawal symptoms, and risks of overdose and ''addiction'', and have not been found to be significantly effective for helping individuals with PTSD.'  "
Is it possible to prevent PTSD?,"'While disaster-preparedness training is a good idea in terms of improving the immediate physical safety and logistical issues involved with a traumatic event, such training may also provide important preventive factors against developing PTSD. That is as evidenced by the fact that those with more professional-level training and experience (for example, police, firefighters, mental health professionals, paramedics, and other medical professionals) tend to develop PTSD less often when coping with disaster than those without the benefit of such training or experience. People who have experienced trauma but are not members of those professions have been found to be less likely to develop PTSD if they receive imaging exposure and therapeutic processing by trained professionals within a day of the trauma and weekly sessions for at least two weeks thereafter.''There are medications that help prevent the development of PTSD. Some medicines that treat depression, decrease the heart rate, or increase the action of other body chemicals are effective tools in the prevention of PTSD when given in the days immediately after an individual experiences a traumatic event.' "
What is the prognosis for PTSD?,"'A number of factors improve the prognosis (outlook) for people with PTSD. They include personal attributes like above-average cognitive abilities, high self-esteem and optimism, interpersonal abilities like good social skills, problem solving, and impulse control, and external factors like secure attachment, sense of safety, and environmental stability.' "
How can people cope with PTSD?,"'Some suggested ways for PTSD patients to cope with this illness include learning more about the disorder as well as talking to friends, family, professionals, and PTSD survivors for support. Joining a support group may be helpful. Other tips include reducing stress by using relaxation techniques (for example, breathing exercises, positive imagery), actively participating in treatment as recommended by professionals, increasing positive lifestyle practices (for example, ''exercise'', healthy eating, distracting oneself through keeping a healthy work schedule if employed, volunteering whether employed or not), and minimizing negative lifestyle practices like substance abuse, social isolation, working to excess, and self-destructive or ''suicidal'' behaviors.'

"What is marijuana, and how is it abused?","'Marijuana is a plant whose scientific name is ''Cannabis sativa''. Its leaves, seeds, stems, and/or roots are consumed by marijuana users for the purpose of feeling intoxicated (""high""). Although the plant contains hundreds of compounds, the one that has major intoxicating effects is called tetrahydrocannibinol (THC). Although medical marijuana is legal in a few states of the United States, it is one of many illegal drugs in most jurisdictions. Specifically, laws in most states deem it illegal to engage in possession of marijuana, either for the purpose of your own use or for the purpose of distributing it to others. ''Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal substance worldwide. While the number of people who use marijuana at any one time does not seem to have increased in the past decade, the number of people who have a marijuana-related disorder has increased significantly. This seems to be particularly true for elderly individuals as well as for young Hispanic and African-American adults. In ''teens'', boys remain more likely than girls to smoke or otherwise use marijuana. Native-American adolescents seem to be the ethnic group most vulnerable to engage in recent marijuana use, and Asian adolescents tend to be the least likely. '  "
What is medical marijuana? How is medical marijuana prescribed?,"'Medical marijuana, also called marinol (Dronabinol), is a synthetic form of marijuana. It comes in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg capsules and is used for the treatment of poor appetite and food intake (''anorexia'') with ''weight loss'' in people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (''AIDS'') and for the ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' due to ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' in individuals who have not responded adequately to usual treatments for those symptoms. When used for appetite stimulation, marinol is usually dosed at 2.5 mg once or twice per day before lunch, dinner, and/or bedtime. When it is being prescribed to quell nausea, it is usually prescribed at 5 mg, one to three hours before a chemotherapy treatment and every two to four hours after chemotherapy, up to six doses per day.''The most common physical side effects of marinol include asthenia (''lack of energy''), stomach upset, nausea, ''vomiting'', racing ''heart'' rate, facial flushing, and ''dizziness''.''The most common psychological side effects of marinol include ''anxiety'', sleepiness, ''confusion'', ''hallucinations'', and ''paranoia''.''This medication should, therefore, be used with caution in persons who have a ''mental health'' diagnosis, particularly ''depression'', ''mood swings'', ''schizophrenia'', or ''substance abuse''. When prescribed for those people, the individual is usually under the care of a psychiatrist.' "
What are other names for marijuana?,"'There are many, many ways of referring to marijuana. The technical term for marijuana is cannabis. Some terms like pot, hemp, herb, reefer, ganja, and weed refer to the substance itself. A higher potency form of marijuana is often called hashish or hash. Other words like joints, blunts, backwoods, buds, or bongs refer to the way that marijuana is smoked. Marijuana is also often smoked in pipes or baked in food, like brownies. ' "
What is the history and different types of marijuana?,"'The history of marijuana goes back for thousands of years. It was only made illegal in many countries during the 20th century. In the past 20 years in the United States, the legalization pros and cons of medical marijuana have been intensely debated as it has become legal to use it in 20 states and the District of Columbia. In those jurisdictions, people for whom medical marijuana has been specifically recommended by a physician must carry a (medical) marijuana card that indicates their use of the substance for a clear medical purpose. Individuals who do not carry such a card risk prosecution for marijuana possession. Different states that allow for legal use of marijuana have different guidelines for the legality of possessing and using medical marijuana. For example, at least one bans home cultivation, and there are regulations concerning the operations of dispensaries in some states. ''Federal laws continue to deem marijuana possession, as well as its distribution, as illegal, whether it is used for medicinal purposes or not. While the prosecution rates of individuals who carry small amounts of the substance along with a medical marijuana card tend to be low, dispensaries in states that have legalized medical marijuana remain criminalized and are therefore often raided by law-enforcement agencies. ''Attempts to completely legalize the use of marijuana, whether for medicinal purposes or not, remain strongly contested in most jurisdictions. For example, in 2010, Proposition 19, a measure that would have completely legalized possession and growing marijuana then taxed and regulated its use was defeated in the state of California. However, California already reduced legal sanctions for possessing small amounts of marijuana to the level comparable to the penalty for speeding on a freeway. '""There are a variety of marijuana types, also called strains. Strains tend to be based on leaf color as indicated in pictures, as well as the strains' potency and medical purpose. Medical strains of marijuana are specifically grown for a particular health benefit, like ""'pain management'' or reduction of nausea. Some states place restrictions on the strains of marijuana that may be legally used and sold. Marijuana dispensaries often sell hydroponic marijuana seeds through mail order, which can be grown in nutrient solution, with or without soil. ' "
Is marijuana addictive?,"'Numerous research studies show that marijuana is indeed an addictive substance. The rate of addiction to marijuana has increased for all age groups. Teens are using the drug at younger ages. About one out of every six adolescents who use marijuana develop addiction to it, and half the people who receive treatment for marijuana use are under the age of 25. While the frequency of use seems to have remained the same over the past several years, adults are becoming dependent on marijuana more often. Theories about potential reasons for that increase include increased access to marijuana that is of higher potency, as well as a lower age at which many individuals first use this drug. ''The symptoms of addiction to marijuana are similar to those of any other addictive substance. As with any other drug, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of marijuana addiction, the individual must suffer from a negative pattern of use of this drug, which results in significant problems or suffering, with at least three of the following symptoms occurring at the same time in the same one year period: ''The symptoms of marijuana withdrawal are similar to those of other drugs, especially tobacco. Those symptoms usually start one to two days after last using marijuana and include irritability, anger, ''depression'', ''insomnia'"", drug craving, and decreased appetite. These symptoms tend to interfere with the individual's attempts to stop using marijuana and can motivate the use of both marijuana and other drugs for relief. The symptoms of withdrawal tend to peak within four to six days and last from one to three weeks. "" Tolerance (decreased effects of marijuana over time or needing to increase the amount used to achieve the desired effect)  Withdrawal (characteristic symptoms that occur when the individual abstains from using marijuana for some days)  Often taking marijuana in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than planned Persistent desire to use marijuana or trouble decreasing or controlling its use Spending significant time either obtaining marijuana (for example, buying, growing), using it, or recovering from its effects Significant social, educational, occupational, or leisure activities are either abandoned or significantly decreased as a result of marijuana's use Marijuana use continues despite being aware of or experiencing persistent or repeated physical or psychological problems as a result of its use "
What are abusing marijuana effects on brain?,"'The bad effects of marijuana are numerous. For example, it can impair thinking, as in learning, and memory for several days after each time it is used. That risk seems to be even higher for people who score lower on IQ tests compared to those who score higher.''The social effects of ''smoking'' marijuana can be quite detrimental as well. Adolescents who use the substance are at higher risk of ''pregnancy'', dropping out of school, delinquency, legal problems, and achieving less educationally and occupationally. Individuals who become dependent on marijuana tend to be less motivated, less happy, or satisfied with their life. They are also at risk for ''depression'' and for using larger amounts of ''alcohol'' and other drugs.' "
What are abusing marijuana effects on body?,"'In terms of how long marijuana tends to stay in your system, it can be detected on drug tests for about two weeks. Like many other chemicals that are ingested, marijuana can affect your body in many ways. It seems to be associated with an increased occurrence of certain ''cancers''. It may also increase the risk of sexual dysfunction; statistics indicate that men who smoke or otherwise consume marijuana regularly are at higher risk of either having ''premature ejaculation'' or trouble reaching ''orgasm''. Men and women who use this substance on a regular basis seem to have more sexual partners and to be more at risk for contracting ''sexually transmitted diseases'' compared to those who do not use marijuana.'""Marijuana's effects on the body and brain of a developing fetus seem to be clearly negative. Exposure to this substance before birth (prenatally) is associated with negative effects on fetal growth and body weight, as well as on the impulse control, focusing ability, learning, memory, and decision making in the child who was exposed to marijuana before birth. These negative effects by no means only affect ""'babies'' who are exposed to marijuana before birth (in utero). Marijuana tends to negatively affect learning, judgment, and muscle skills in people who use marijuana by their own volition.' "
What are the treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'Most individuals with marijuana abuse or dependence are treated on an outpatient basis. Admission to outpatient and inpatient treatment programs for marijuana addiction has increased over the years to the point that the addiction to this substance is nearly as high as dependence on other illegal drugs, like ''cocaine'' or ''heroin''.''Behavioral treatments, like motivational enhancement therapy (MET), cognitive-behavioral therapy (''CBT''), and contingency management (CM), as well as family-based treatments have been found to be effective treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction.''In addition to the individual therapies just described, adolescents who abuse or are addicted to marijuana are often treated using one or more family therapies. These include multidimensional therapy, multisystemic therapy, family support network intervention, and brief strategic family therapy. Each of these interventions uses techniques that are designed to enhance the skills of the addicted individual and his or her family members as a way of discouraging marijuana use.''Although there is no medication that has yet been shown to be a clearly effective treatment of marijuana-use disorders, research shows that ''antidepressant'' medications like ''nefazodone'' (''Serzone'') and ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac'') may help some individuals manage marijuana withdrawal and to avoid relapse, respectively. Oral THC (Dronabinol) may also help alleviate symptoms of marijuana withdrawal. Successful psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of marijuana abuse or addiction include motivational approaches to coping skills development.' MET is designed to lessen the resistance a person who abuses marijuana may have to abstain from using it. This intervention is also designed to motivate the individual to change. CBT teaches people who abuse marijuana skills to help them stop using the drug and to ways to avoid or manage other problems that might prevent them from marijuana use recovery. CM usually provides marijuana users with vouchers of increasing value as a reward for repeatedly testing negative for (the absence of) drugs over time. Those vouchers are then exchanged for positive items or services that promote the person's participation in more positive (pro-social) activities, like securing employment or advancing their education or health."
Can marijuana abuse and addiction be prevented?,"'In order to prevent marijuana use, abuse, and addiction, an understanding of the risk factors for those issues is essential. In teens, availability of marijuana in their environment, as well as a tendency to engage in negative behaviors (deviancy) increase the likelihood of marijuana use. For some adolescents, using legal substances like alcohol and tobacco can be gateway drugs for marijuana use, in that the use of those substances increases the likelihood that the teen will use marijuana. ' "
What is the prognosis of marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'While many people with a marijuana-use disorder successfully stop using it with outpatient ''psychotherapy'' that provides motivation and teaches coping skills, the relapse rate is quite high. However, when treatment is provided frequently, that statistic improves. Individuals who begin ''smoking'' marijuana before 17 years of age seem to be more than three times more likely to attempt ''suicide'' than those who either never use the substance or do so after the age of 17. That risk goes the other way as well, in that people who develop depression or have thoughts of ''suicide'' before the age of 17 seem to be at a much higher risk of developing an addiction to marijuana. People who are vulnerable to developing psychosis (for example, having hallucinations like seeing things or ''hearing'"" voices that aren't there; or ""'delusions'', like unfounded beliefs that others are trying to harm him or her) may be more likely to do so if marijuana is used, even on a medicinal basis. Marijuana abuse or addiction is also associated with a much higher risk of developing a dependence on other drugs.' "

What is postural tachycardia syndrome?,'Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance (OI) as their primary symptom. OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position.'  
Who gets POT syndrome?,"'Anyone at any age can develop POTS, but the majority of individuals affected (between 75 and 80 percent) are women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age.''Some women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods. POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness. It may make individuals unable to ''exercise'' because the activity brings on ''fainting'' spells or ''dizziness''.' "
What causes POT syndrome?,"""Doctors aren't sure yet what causes the reduced return of blood to the heart that occurs in OI, or why the heart begins to beat so rapidly in POTS. Current thinking is that there are a number of mechanisms. Some patients have peripheral denervation (neuropathic POTS); some have symptoms that are due to sustained or parosyxmal overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperadrenergic POTS); and some individuals have PTOS dominated by features of deconditioning."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of POT syndrome?,"'The primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting. In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again.' "
"What treatments, therapies, diets, and excercises can help the symptoms of POT syndrome?",'Therapies for POTS are targeted at relieving low blood volume or regulating circulatory problems that could be causing the disorder. No single treatment has been found to be effect for all. A number of ''drugs'' seem to be effective in the short term. Whether they help in long term is uncertain. Simple interventions such as adding extra salt to the ''diet'' and attention to adequate fluid intake are often effective. The drugs ''fludrocortisone'' (for those on a high salt diet) and ''midodrine'' in low doses are often used to increase blood volume and narrow blood vessels. Drinking 16 ounces of water (2 glassfuls) before getting up can also help raise ''blood pressure''. Some individuals are helped by beta receptor blocking agents. There is some evidence that an ''exercise'' program can gradually improve orthostatic tolerance.'  
What is the prognosis?,"'POTS may follow a relapsing-remitting course, in which symptoms come and go, for years. In most cases (approximately 80 percent), an individual with POTS improves and becomes functional, although some residual symptoms are common.' "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to POTS in their laboratories at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as POTS.' "
What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased potassium is known as hyperkalemia. Potassium is normally excreted by the kidneys, so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. Certain medications may also predispose an individual to hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia, or decreased potassium, can arise due to kidney diseases; excessive losses due to heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, eating disorders, certain medications, or other causes."
Chloride,"'Chloride is the major anion (negatively charged ion) found in the fluid outside of cells and in the blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid.\xa0Chloride plays a role in helping the body maintain a normal balance of fluids.''The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences:''The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.' Increased chloride (hyperchloremia): Elevations in chloride may be seen in diarrhea, certain kidney diseases, and sometimes in overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Decreased chloride (hypochloremia): Chloride is normally lost in the urine, sweat, and stomach secretions. Excessive loss can occur from heavy sweating, vomiting, and adrenal gland and kidney disease."
Bicarbonate,"'The bicarbonate ion acts as a buffer to maintain the normal levels of acidity (pH) in blood and other fluids in the body. Bicarbonate levels are measured to monitor the acidity of the blood and body fluids. The acidity is affected by foods or medications that we ingest and the function of the kidneys and ''lungs''. The chemical notation for bicarbonate on most lab reports is HCO3- or represented as the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22-30 mmol/L. ''The bicarbonate test is usually performed along with tests for other blood electrolytes. ''Disruptions in the normal bicarbonate level'' may be due to diseases that interfere with respiratory function, kidney diseases, metabolic conditions, or other causes.' "
What is postural tachycardia syndrome?,'Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance (OI) as their primary symptom. OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position.'  
Who gets POT syndrome?,"'Anyone at any age can develop POTS, but the majority of individuals affected (between 75 and 80 percent) are women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age.''Some women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods. POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness. It may make individuals unable to ''exercise'' because the activity brings on ''fainting'' spells or ''dizziness''.' "
What causes POT syndrome?,"""Doctors aren't sure yet what causes the reduced return of blood to the heart that occurs in OI, or why the heart begins to beat so rapidly in POTS. Current thinking is that there are a number of mechanisms. Some patients have peripheral denervation (neuropathic POTS); some have symptoms that are due to sustained or parosyxmal overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperadrenergic POTS); and some individuals have PTOS dominated by features of deconditioning."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of POT syndrome?,"'The primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting. In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again.' "
"What treatments, therapies, diets, and excercises can help the symptoms of POT syndrome?",'Therapies for POTS are targeted at relieving low blood volume or regulating circulatory problems that could be causing the disorder. No single treatment has been found to be effect for all. A number of ''drugs'' seem to be effective in the short term. Whether they help in long term is uncertain. Simple interventions such as adding extra salt to the ''diet'' and attention to adequate fluid intake are often effective. The drugs ''fludrocortisone'' (for those on a high salt diet) and ''midodrine'' in low doses are often used to increase blood volume and narrow blood vessels. Drinking 16 ounces of water (2 glassfuls) before getting up can also help raise ''blood pressure''. Some individuals are helped by beta receptor blocking agents. There is some evidence that an ''exercise'' program can gradually improve orthostatic tolerance.'  
What is the prognosis?,"'POTS may follow a relapsing-remitting course, in which symptoms come and go, for years. In most cases (approximately 80 percent), an individual with POTS improves and becomes functional, although some residual symptoms are common.' "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to POTS in their laboratories at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as POTS.' "
What are the types of Powassan virus (POW virus)?,"'Powassan (POW) virus is a ''Flavivirus'', a genus in the family of ''Arbovirus''; it is related to viruses such as ''West Nile virus''. The virus is named after Powassan, Ontario, where it was first discovered in 1958. Two types of Powassan virus have been found in North America, including lineage 1 and lineage 2 (deer tick virus) types of POW viruses. Linage 1 type is associated with ''Ixodes cookeri'', ''Ixodes marxi'', and ''Ixodes scapularis'' tick species, while linage 2 virus is only associated with ''Ixodes scapularis'' ''ticks''. Unfortunately, the tick that usually bites humans and is infected is ''Ixodes scapularis'' so humans can be infected with either virus type.' "
What is Powassan virus disease?,'Powassan virus disease is a rare disease caused by a virus that is spread to humans by infected ticks. There have been approximately 75 individuals diagnosed with this disease in the United States in the last 10 years. The disease caused by the virus is an inflammation of the brain tissue (encephalitis).' 
What causes Powassan virus disease?,"'The cause of the disease is viral infection that leads to inflammation of the brain tissue (encephalitis). The viruses are transmitted to humans by ticks. When a tick carrying the virus feeds on a person (tick bite or blood meal), the viruses are transmitted from the tick to the human. The incubation period (time from exposure to time of symptoms) varies from about one week to one month. Mortality (death) rates for this disease very greatly in the medical literature and range from about 1%-2% to a high of 60% of cases.' "
What are risk factors for Powassan virus disease?,"'The risk factors include living or working in brushy or wooded areas because of the potential for exposure to ticks that are vectors of the virus. Consequently, a tick bite is a risk factor for this disease. The majority of infected individuals live in the northeastern or Great Lakes regions of the United States.' "
Where have most incidences of Powassan virus disease occurred?,"'Most incidences of Powassan virus disease occur in people who are exposed to brushy or wooded areas that contain ticks. In the U.S., the majority of infected individuals live in the northeastern states like Massachusetts (even in Cape Cod), New York, New Jersey, and the Great Lakes regions and became infected when ticks were most active (late spring to early fall). Detection of the disease is slowly occurring in other states (see Pennsylvania and Virginia on map below).' "
What are signs and symptoms of Powassan virus disease?,"'Fortunately, most people who become infected do not develop any symptoms or signs. However, in patients who do develop symptoms, the symptoms may be severe. Symptoms that may develop are as follows:'  Fever Headache Vomiting Weakness Confusion Loss of coordination (difficulty walking and talking) Speech difficulties Memory problems Seizures"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose Powassan virus disease?,"""Diagnosis is based on a combination of the patient's history (especially a tick bite) and physical examination along with ongoing signs and symptoms. If the disease is suspected, testing of blood and spinal fluid may detect antibodies against the Powassan virus and confirm the diagnosis. Often, an infectious disease specialist is consulted if this rare disease is suspected."" "
What is the treatment for Powassan virus disease?,"'Treatment for this disease is mainly supportive. It may include hospitalization, respiratory support, IV fluids, and other treatments to reduce symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no specific medicine to cure or to treat Powassan virus disease.' "
Are there home remedies for Powassan virus disease?,"'There are no home remedies to treat this disease. However, there are home remedies to keep ticks from biting humans. No tick bites equals no disease. Home remedies that claim to keep ticks from biting are cedar oil, lemon eucalyptus oil, and rose geranium essential oil. These act as tick repellents.' "
What are complications of Powassan virus disease?,"'Survivors of severe infection (for example, encephalitis and/or seizures) may have neurological complications. Patients may have permanent problems such as recurrent ''headaches'', muscle wasting, and memory problems.' "
What is the prognosis for Powassan virus disease?,'Those individuals who develop Powassan viral disease with little or no symptoms have a good to excellent prognosis. Those individuals with progressively severe disease have a decreasing prognosis and may develop lifelong complications outlined above or die.' 
Is it possible to prevent Powassan virus disease?,"'Yes, it is possible to prevent this ''tick-borne disease'' by preventing any tick bites. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available to prevent viral infection. Consequently, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has several recommendations on how to prevent tick bites. The CDC suggests using repellent that contains 20% or more DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 on exposed skin and using products that contain permethrin on clothing. Shower soon as possible after coming indoors if you have been in tick-infested areas. In addition, carefully examine children and pets for the presence of ticks. Removing a tick may prevent transmission of the virus if done appropriately and shortly after the tick has attached to the skin.' "
What are postpartum depression and peripartum depression? Are there different types of peripartum depression?,"'Postpartum depression, now included in the describer of depression with peripartum onset (during pregnancy or within a month after giving birth), may be the most common problem associated with ''childbirth''. It has been described as afflicting prominent historical figures like author/suffragist Charlotte Perkins Gilman in the 19th century. This illness is characterized by depression that a woman experiences either during pregnancy or within four weeks of giving birth, affecting about 3%-6% of women who give birth, up to 20% when only women with postpartum depression, rather than including those who are ''depressed'' during the pregnancy are counted. Peripartum depression, as well as postpartum ''anxiety'', occurs after one out of every eight deliveries in the United States, affecting about half a million women every year. Peripartum depression is also called ''major depression'' with peripartum onset. Delusional thinking after ''childbirth'', called postpartum psychosis, affects about one in every 500 to 1,000 women.''Notably, postpartum depression is not an illness that is exclusive to mothers. Fathers can experience it, as well. As with women, symptoms in men can result in fathers having difficulty caring for themselves and for their children when suffering from postpartum depression.''Unfortunately, up to 50% of individuals with postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis are never detected. That can result in devastating outcomes for the patient and family. For example, postpartum psychosis is thought to have been a potential factor in Andrea Yates ''drowning'' her five children in 2001 and was explored as a factor in Susan Smith drowning her two sons in 1994.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for postpartum depression?,"'Similar to many other ''mental health'' conditions, there is thought to be a genetic vulnerability to developing postpartum depression, in that people who have family members who have had this or any other ''mental illness'' have a higher risk of developing postpartum depression compared with people who have no such family history.''Rapid changes in reproductive hormone levels (like estrogen and ''progesterone'') that occur during pregnancy and after delivery are thought to be biological factors in the development of this condition. People with any history of depression, ''anxiety'', ''alcohol'' or another substance use disorder prior to the pregnancy are at risk for developing depression during the pregnancy or within a few weeks after delivery. Examples of specific illnesses that have been associated with being associated with the potential to develop postpartum depression include any form of major depression, such as ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'', ''bipolar disorder'' and ''generalized anxiety disorder''.''Interestingly, men are also known to experience changes in a number of hormonal changes during the peripartum period that can contribute to the development of PPD. Also, the ''stress'' of any medical complications as a result of the pregnancy or delivery, as well as the ''stress'' that is inherent in caring for a ''newborn'' are considerable factors.''Further risk factors for developing postpartum depression include age younger than 20 years, low self-esteem or life stressors like low socioeconomic status, a lack of having social support before and after the birth of the baby, and marital problems, including any history of intimate partner violence.' "
What are postpartum depression symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of postpartum depression begin either during pregnancy or within four weeks after having a baby and include the following:''Postpartum psychosis occurs much more rarely and is thought to be a severe form of postpartum depression. Symptoms of that disorder include the following:'  Feelings of profound sadness, emptiness, emotional numbness, irritability, or anger. A tendency to withdraw from relationships with family, friends, or from activities that are usually pleasurable for the PPD sufferer Constant fatigue or tiredness, difficulty sleeping, overeating, or loss of appetite A strong sense of failure or inadequacy Intense concern and anxiety about the baby or a lack of interest in the baby Thoughts about suicide or fears of harming the baby Delusions (false beliefs) Hallucinations (for example, hearing voices or seeing things that are not real) Suicidal thoughts Thoughts of harming the baby Severe depressive symptoms"
What tests to doctors use to diagnose postpartum depression?,"""There is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has PPD. Therefore, health care providers diagnose this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health history. Patients tend to benefit when the health care provider takes into account their client's entire life and background. This includes, but is not limited to, the person's gender, sexual orientation, cultural, religious, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and as part of screening the individual for medical conditions that might contribute to mental health symptoms.""'Postpartum depression must be distinguished from what is commonly called the postpartum blues or ""baby blues,"" which tend to occur in most new mothers. In the brief mood problem of baby blues, symptoms like crying, sadness, irritability, ''anxiety'', and ''confusion'"" can occur. In contrast to the symptoms of PPD, the symptoms of the baby blues tend to occur within a few days postpartum, peaking around the fourth day after delivery, resolve by the tenth day and do not tend to affect the individual's ability to function.""'Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that requires immediate intervention because of the danger that the sufferer might kill their baby or themselves. Postpartum psychosis usually begins within the first two weeks after delivery. Symptoms of this disorder tend to involve extremely disorganized thinking, bizarre behavior, unusual hallucinations, and delusions. Postpartum psychosis is often a symptom of ''bipolar disorder'', previously called ''manic'' depression.' "
What are the treatments for postpartum depression?,"'Treatment of postpartum depression in men and women is similar. Both mothers and fathers with this condition have been found to greatly benefit from being educated about the illness, as well as from the support of other parents who have been in this position.''Psychotherapies''Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") involves working with a trained therapist to determine methods to solve problems and cope with all forms of depression, including postpartum depression. It can be a powerful intervention and may produce, positive biochemical changes in the brain. This is a particularly important alternative to treatment with medication in women who are breastfeeding. In general, these therapies take weeks to months to complete. More intense counseling may be needed for longer when treating very severe depression or other psychiatric symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy'' (IPT): This helps to alleviate depressive symptoms and helps the person with PPD develop more effective skills for coping with social and interpersonal relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals.''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT''): This helps to alleviate depression and reduce the likelihood it will return by helping the PPD sufferer change his or her way of thinking. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals.''Medication therapy for postpartum depression usually involves the use of an ''antidepressant'' medication. The major types of antidepressant medication are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine/''dopamine'' reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs), the ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs), and the ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs'""). SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group. People with depression or anxiety during pregnancy or postpartum (the two together being known as the perinatal period) should consult with their doctor about safety issues for the developing fetus then the new baby. That issue should also be addressed with the baby's pediatrician for ""'babies'' who receive ''breast milk''. Examples of ''antidepressants'' are listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.''SSRIs''SNRIs and NDRs:''TCAs are sometimes prescribed in severe cases of depression or when SSRIs or SNRIs are ineffective. These medications affect a number of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters), especially epinephrine and norepinephrine (also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively). Examples include''About two-thirds of people who take antidepressant medications improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to notice mood improvement. It is, therefore, important not to stop taking the medication because benefits may not be seen immediately. The MAOIs are not often used since the introduction of the SSRIs. Because of the possibility of interactions, the MAOIs may not be taken with many other types of medication, and some types of foods that are high in tyramine (like aged cheeses, wines, and cured meats) must be avoided as well. Examples of MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Atypical neuroleptic medications are often prescribed in addition to a mood-stabilizer medication in people with severe postpartum depression or who have postpartum psychosis. Examples of atypical neuroleptics include''Non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications are also sometimes used with a neuroleptic medication to treat people with postpartum psychosis because ''bipolar disorder'' may also be present in some patients. Examples of non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include''Electroconvulsive therapy''Electroconvulsive therapy (''ECT''), previously called electroshock therapy or ''shock'' treatment, is a therapy that addresses severe psychiatric symptoms. It involves inducing ''seizures'"" in people by placing electrodes on the person's head, usually on what corresponds to one side of the brain. The treatment occurs while the person is fully sedated to avoid any distress associated with having ""'seizures''. Health care professionals administer treatments up to three times per week for at least one week, continuing until symptoms have significantly improved. Side effects usually include confusion and ''memory loss'' immediately after the procedure, the latter of which may take weeks to resolve.''Also effective in treating many people with severe depression, psychosis, and the ''mood swings'' associated with ''manic depressive'' (bipolar disorder) episodes in general, ECT is effective in treating postpartum psychosis and severe forms of postpartum depression. In fact, there is research that indicates higher response of people with depression or psychosis during the postpartum period compared with those symptoms outside of the postpartum period'  The first is education about the nature of depression. The therapist will emphasize that depression is a common illness and that most people can expect to get better with treatment. The second is defining specific problems (such as child care pressures or interpersonal conflicts). After the problems are defined, the therapist is able to help set realistic goals for solving these problems. Together, the individual with PPD and his or her therapist will use various treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote cooperation. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the person with PPD to being depressed. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the individual with PPD more effective strategies for dealing with problems.

What is the prognosis of postpartum depression?,"'Women who have suffered from postpartum depression are much more likely to have depression again sometime in the future. They are also at risk for poor ''diet'' and low compliance with medical recommendations, as well as having more financial problems, being the victim of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as for developing tobacco or other ''substance abuse''. Children of mothers with PPD are at risk for medical emotional challenges as a result of problematic relationships with their mother and of receiving compromised care from their mother.' "
Is it possible to prevent postpartum depression?,"'Intensive nursing intervention in the form of visits to new mothers by a nurse can help prevent the development of postpartum depression. Screening women before they become ''pregnant'' (pre-pregnancy), screening parents for the early signs, and gathering history about any family members who have suffered from depression, anxiety, or any other mental health problem are other important tools for preventing the progression of minor symptoms to a full-blown illness.'

What research is being done on postpartum depression?,"'The current research on postpartum depression includes an increased focus on this condition in men, as well as potential natural remedies based on surges in certain brain chemicals associated with the postpartum period.' "
What is the tuberculosis skin test?,"""The tuberculosis skin test determines if someone has developed an immune response to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). This response can occur if someone currently has TB, if they were exposed to it in the past, or if they received the BCG vaccine against TB (which is not administered in the U.S.). Estimates indicate that one-third of the world's population has latent TB, and around 1.3 million people worldwide die of TB each year. The tuberculin test or PPD (purified protein derivative) test are other names for the tuberculosis skin test.""'The tuberculin skin test is based on the fact that infection with ''M. tuberculosis'' bacterium produces a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction to certain components of the bacterium. Medical professionals extract the components of the organism from TB cultures and are the core elements of the classic tuberculin PPD (also known as purified protein derivative). This PPD material is used for skin testing for tuberculosis. Reaction in the skin to tuberculin PPD begins when specialized immune cells, called T cells, sensitized by prior infection, are attracted by the immune system to the skin site where they release chemical messengers called lymphokines. These lymphokines induce induration (a hard, raised area with clearly defined margins at and around the injection site) through local vasodilation (expansion of the diameter of blood vessels) leading to fluid deposition known as ''edema'', fibrin deposition, and attraction of other types of inflammatory cells to the area.''An incubation period of two to 12 weeks is usually necessary after exposure to the TB bacteria in order for the PPD test to be positive. Anyone can have a TB test, and physicians can perform the test on infants, ''pregnant'' women, or ''HIV''-infected people with no danger. It is only contraindicated in people who have had a severe reaction to a previous tuberculin skin test.' "
How do medical professionals administer the tuberculosis skin test?,"'The standard recommended tuberculin test, known as the Mantoux test, is administered by injecting a 0.1 mL of a liquid containing 5 TU (tuberculin units) of PPD into the top layers of skin (intradermally, immediately under the surface of the skin) of the forearm. Health care providers should use a skin area that is free of abnormalities and away from veins. Typically, medical professionals make the injection using a 27-gauge needle and a tuberculin syringe. Inject the tuberculin PPD just beneath the surface of the skin. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6 mm-10 mm in diameter should be produced when the injection is done correctly. This wheal or ""bleb"" is generally quickly absorbed. If it becomes apparent that the first test was improperly administered, another test can be given at once, selecting a site several centimeters away from the original injection.' "
What is the method of reading the tuberculosis skin test?,"'""Reading"" the skin test means detecting a raised, thickened local area of skin reaction, referred to as induration. Induration is the key item to detect, not redness or ''bruising''. Read skin tests 48-72 hours after the injection when the size of the induration is maximal. Tests read after 72 hours tend to underestimate the size of the induration and are not accurate.' "
"How 
do physicians interpret skin test results?","'The basis of the reading of the skin test is the presence or absence and the amount of induration (localized swelling). A physician will measure the diameter of the induration transversely (for example, perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters. The area of induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. It is important to note that redness is not measured.''A tuberculin reaction is classified as positive based on the diameter of the induration in conjunction with certain patient-specific risk factors. In a healthy person whose immune system is normal, induration greater than or equal to 15 mm is considered a positive skin test. If ''blisters'' are present (vesiculation), the test is also considered positive.''In some groups of people, the test is considered positive if induration less than 15 mm is present. For example, an area of induration of 10 mm is considered positive in the following groups:''An induration of 5 mm is considered positive for the following groups:''On the other hand, a negative test does not always mean that a person is free of tuberculosis. People who have been infected with TB may not have a positive skin test (known as a false negative result) if their immune function is compromised by chronic medical conditions, ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', or ''AIDS''. Additionally, 10%-25% of people with newly diagnosed tuberculosis of the ''lungs'' will also have a negative result, possibly due to poor immune function, poor ''nutrition'', accompanying viral infection, or steroid therapy. Over 50% of patients with widespread, disseminated TB (spread throughout the body, known as miliary TB) will also have a negative TB test.''A person who received a BCG vaccine (administered in some countries but not the U.S.) against tuberculosis may also have a positive skin reaction to the TB test, although this is not always the case. This is an example of a false positive result. The positive reaction that is due to the vaccine may persist for years. Those who were vaccinated after the first year of life or who had more than one dose of the vaccine have the greatest likelihood of having a persistent positive result than those who were vaccinated as infants.''People infected with other types of mycobacteria other than ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' may also have false-positive TB skin tests.' Recent immigrants from high-prevalence areas Residents and employees of high-risk areas IV drug abusers Children under 4 years old People who work with mycobacteria in laboratories People with suppressed immune systems HIV-infected people People with changes seen on chest X-ray that are consistent with previous TB Recent contacts of people with TB People who have received organ transplants"
Are there side effects or risks from having the PPD skin test?,"'The test typically does not produce side effects. There is a very slight risk of having a severe reaction to the test, including swelling and redness of the arm, particularly in people who have had tuberculosis or been infected previously and in those who have previously had the BCG vaccine. ''Allergic'' reactions are also rare complications.''Since the test does not use live bacteria, so there is no chance of developing tuberculosis from the test.'  "
What is Prader-Willi syndrome?,"'Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. In infancy, this condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, and delayed development. Beginning in childhood, some affected individuals develop an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly those with obesity, also develop ''type 2 diabetes'' mellitus (the most common form of ''diabetes'').' "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and features of Prader-Willi syndrome?","'People with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual impairment and learning disabilities. Behavioral problems are common, including ''temper tantrums'', stubbornness, and compulsive behavior. Many affected individuals also have ''sleep'' abnormalities. ''Additional features of this condition include distinctive facial features, short stature, and small hands and feet. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome have unusually fair skin and light-colored hair. Both affected males and affected females have underdeveloped genitals. Puberty is delayed or incomplete, and most affected individuals are unable to have children (''infertile'').' "
"How common is, and what causes Prader-Willi syndrome?","""Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of genes in a specific region of chromosome 15. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. Some genes are turned on (active) only on the copy that is inherited from a person's father (the paternal copy). This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Prader-Willi syndrome occurs when the region of the paternal chromosome 15 containing these genes is missing.""'Researchers are working to identify genes on chromosome 15 that are responsible for the characteristic features of Prader-Willi syndrome. They have determined that a deletion of the OCA2 gene on chromosome 15 is associated with unusually fair skin and light-colored hair in some affected individuals. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Researchers have not definitively connected any other genes with specific signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome.''Most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the paternal chromosome 15 is deleted in each cell. In another 25 percent of cases, a person with Prader-Willi syndrome has two copies of chromosome 15 inherited from his or her mother (maternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called maternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Prader-Willi syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect that abnormally turns off (inactivates) genes on the paternal chromosome 15. Each of these genetic changes results in a loss of gene function in a critical region of chromosome 15.' "
Can Prader-Willi syndrome be inherited?,"'Most cases of Prader-Willi syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the paternal chromosome 15 or by maternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.''Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a genetic defect that abnormally inactivates genes on the paternal chromosome 15 to be passed from one generation to the next.' "

What is prediabetes?,'Prediabetes is the term used to describe elevated blood sugar (glucose) that has not yet reached the threshold of a ''type 2 diabetes'' diagnosis. Consider pre-''diabetes'' a warning sign that it is time to take your health more seriously.' 
What is the difference between prediabetes and type 2 diabetes?,"'Without reversing prediabetes, blood sugar continues to rise and signs and ''symptoms of diabetes'' may develop. The most common symptoms and early signs are ''thirst'' and excess urination. Sometimes people will notice unexplained ''weight loss''. Later signs of ''type 2 diabetes'' are' Prediabetes occurs when there is too much sugar (glucose) in the blood. It is an early warning sign that the body has more sugar in the blood then it can use. Type 2 diabetes is a condition that occurs slowly over time. The pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to keep up with the increased need to move sugar into the cells for energy. Medication and lifestyle changes are necessary to manage blood sugar levels and avoid diabetes complications. 
Type 1 diabetes is different, and results from auto-immune attacks on the pancreas. Fatigue Blurry vision Slow healing wounds or bruises Thirst Excess urination Unusual smell to the 
urine"
What are the signs and symptoms of prediabetes?,"'Unfortunately, there really are no symptoms or signs of prediabetes. It almost always is diagnosed by chance during a medical screening or routine bloodwork. This is why it is important to get screened, especially if you are ''overweight'' or have family members with ''diabetes'' or pre-''diabetes''. However, the most common sign associated with prediabetes is being overweight.''It is common for a person with prediabetes to only have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, but the body continues to require increased insulin to maintain it. Hyperinsulinemia or high insulin, has signs and symptoms of:''Occasionally, people may notice they are thirstier than normal or are urinating more frequently.'  Sleepiness (after a meal) Lethargy Weight gain around the abdomen"
"What causes prediabetes, and what are the risk factors for prediabetes?","""Pre-diabetes is a warning sign that metabolism is getting out of balance. Humans are designed to be physically active hunters and gatherers who move a lot and eat only occasionally. This isn't what most of us do. Essentially, the underlying cause of prediabetes is that there is more fuel (glucose) available than can be used up. This can be because of excess intake of dietary carbs and sugars, because of ""'insulin resistance'', or because the ''liver'' is making too much glucose. The easiest causes of prediabetes to manage are insulin resistance and excess dietary intake. For many people with prediabetes, it can be reversed with ''exercise'' in combination with a eating a low-carb ''diet'' (low-''glycemic index'' diet).''Some of the risk factors for prediabetes include' Family history (having a family member with diabetes or prediabetes) Ethnic heritage (Hispanics, Latinos, and African-Americans are at highest risk) Having had gestational diabetes, Having PCOS or polycystic ovarian syndrome, Being overweight or obese, Smoking, Having heart disease, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol Eating too much processed food, sugar, or soda Not being physically active every day Being under high stress and not releasing it in healthy ways like exercise"
Is there a test to diagnose prediabetes (HbA1c and prediabetes chart)?,"'There are three blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes and ''type 2 diabetes''.''Prediabetes glucose levels are shown here in a chart of normal, prediabetes, and diabetes lab test numbers so you can make comparisons.' Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the average blood sugar (glucose) over the last 3 months. It is a measure of how much sugar is attached to your red blood cells. A pre-diabetes level is 5.7% and 6.4%. An HbA1c > 6.5% is considered a diabetes glucose level. Fasting blood sugar or serum glucose is a measure of your blood sugar first thing in the morning before you have eaten anything. Prediabetes also can be identified with serum glucose, or blood sugar level. A fasting blood 
sugar test of 100-125 mg/dl indicates prediabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes also can be diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test. This test measures how high blood sugar levels get at fixed time intervals after consuming a high sugar content beverage. This test is most commonly used to diagnose diabetes related to pregnancy (gestational diabetes)."
Can prediabetes be reversed?,"'Prediabetes can be reversed with lifestyle changes. This includes being more physically active and following a healthy diet plan such as a low glycemic index diet, rich in quality, real foods. ''Quitting smoking'',''stress management'', and keeping ''alcohol'' intake moderate all help too. If lifestyle is not changed, prediabetes usually progresses to diabetes.''When you are working to reverse prediabetes, your health-care professional will advise you on how often you should have your blood tests checked – usually every 3 months.''Having your own personal home glucose monitor (''finger stick'' test) gets you involved in managing your prediabetes, and also can help you track your progress. Write down the numbers and what was consumed to learn how you respond to different meals. This is a great way to test different prediabetes meal plans to find out what foods cause your blood sugar levels to go up the least, and the most!''Do the following to track your meals and foods.' Check your blood sugar and write it down. Enjoy your meal and write down what you ate and the portion sizes. In two hours, check your blood sugar and write it down. Did that meal treat your body well? How much did your blood sugar go up? How did you feel? Keep a log of these readings to discuss them with your health-care professional or nutritionist to problem-solve ways to make better diet choices. This will help you find foods to eat and foods to avoid for your personal situation."
What is the treatment for prediabetes?,"'Prediabetes is best treated with a proactive, renewed commitment to getting healthier, and making healthier choices every day. It can, and usually is, treated with diet and exercise alone. However, some people with prediabetes are treated with a medication called ''metformin'' (''Glucophage'', ''Glucophage'' XR, ''Glumetza'', ''Fortamet'', ''Riomet''). Research published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed that lifestyle changes reduced diabetes incidence by 58% compared to ''metformin'', which reduced the incidence by only 31%.''1''If you have been diagnosed with prediabetes, discuss a treatment plan with your health-care professional.' "
Is there prediabetes diet?,"'The best foods for prediabetes are''The foods to eat for prediabetes are real foods in their natural or whole form. There needs to be a balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Drinking lots of water or unsweetened tea also is important.''And easy way to identify the most important foods to avoid is to avoid any food that is white. This includes''Cauliflower is white, but it is a good food for prediabetes because it is a whole, real vegetable.''It also is best to avoid highly processed foods (like foods that come in boxes or packages already prepared). These foods are high in calories, carbs, chemicals, and low in nutrients and ''vitamins''. Other foods to avoid include:''The take home message is to pay close attention to the quality of all foods - fats, proteins, and carbohydrates – and choose less processed ones.'  healthy proteins and fats, lots of vegetables, some fruits, and some low glycemic index carbohydrates like quinoa, oatmeal, and brown rice. Sugar (and anything made with sugar) White flour (and anything made with flour) White bread White rice White pasta White potato, etc. Fried foods Fatty meat such as prime rib, burgers, bacon, and fatty cuts of pork, sausages, greasy burgers, 
hydrogenated fats. Blackened or burned foods (these cause inflammation) Snack foods like pretzels, chips, or cookies Many “energy bars” (compare nutrition labels - a bar that is friendly for prediabetes will have less than 5 grams of sugars and at least 2 grams of fiber) Meals without any vegetables Sodas, sweetened tea, fruit juice, juice-like sweetened beverages"
What about a low carb diet for prediabetes?,"'A low-carb diet is a great option for prediabetes because it will improve blood sugar, help you ''lose weight'', and help you feel more energetic. Carbohydrates are digested into glucose very easily. A person with prediabetes already has too much sugar in the blood so you don’t want to add any more.''To feel satisfied on a low carb diet you have to eat healthy amounts of protein and fat. Many people continue to try to follow a low-fat or fat-free diet while also trying to make low carb choices, and understandably, feel hungry and frustrated because there is nothing tasty to eat. Recent research published in the ''British Medical Journal'' debunked the low fat hypothesis (that people on a low fat diet have a lower risk of developing prediabetes).''2'' People actually ''are not at a lower risk'' of prediabetes.''The easiest way to choose quality carbohydrates by following a '' low glycemic index diet''. With a low glycemic index diet you balance the carbohydrate/sugar content of a meal with enough ''fiber'', fat, and protein so that the meal is digested and absorbed slowly. This gradually releases glucose into the bloodstream, and thus the body does not require a large amount of insulin. It also provides the body with good, steady energy over many hours.' "
What are examples of good food choices for a prediabetes diet?,"'Choosing quality fats and proteins means choosing real food rather than processed versions. Believe it or not, a serving of organic full-fat Greek yogurt with real raspberries will be much more satisfying, and better for your blood sugar and weight, than the fat-free fruity version.''Good protein choices include:''Organic and grass fed choices are important because what an animal eats changes the ''nutrition'' of the meat. Non-organic and factory-fed animal meats increase inflammation. In prediabetes, this means increased risk for ''heart disease'' and complications.''Make at least some of your meals ''vegetarian'' because plant-based fats are associated with lower oxidized LDL and less inflammation. Good fat choices include''Check labels because hydrogenated fats are often are used in packaged bakery products.' Organic poultry (chicken or turkey) Grass-fed red meat (beef or buffalo) Organic lean pork Wild fish and seafood Whole eggs Plant-based proteins such asbeanslentilsnutsseedstofupeasprotein powders for smoothies beans lentils nuts seeds tofu peas protein powders for smoothies Avocado Olive oil Coconut oil and coconut milk Organic full-fat dairy products Wild, cold water fish Grass-fed red meat Dark meat from pastured poultry"
What about exercise and prediabetes?,"'All exercise helps reverse prediabetes by using up sugar in the bloodstream and improving insulin sensitivity. An exercise plan should focus on two things:''Increasing muscle strength makes the cells of the muscle ""hungrier (more insulin sensitive), and that equals a healthier metabolism. You can build muscle by using weights, your own body weight, or resistance bands. If you choose weight training start slowly, and ask for help using the equipment safely and properly. Begin with low weights, and gradually work up to heavier weights. Lifting one round of heavy weights for only 6-8 repetitions has more benefit than one round of light weights for 10 or more repetitions. If you can do more than 10 repetitions, add more weight.''This plan also is great if you are in a hurry. You can complete a full workout in just 20 minutes twice a week. Work up to this gradually to avoid injury.''If you like cardiovascular exercise, focus on short bursts of high intensity activity. Research studies show that few people ''lose weight'"" by spending an hour on a treadmill or elliptical machine. Lifting heavy weights, and short sprints that make you breathless helps you lose weight best. For most people, this is less than 90 seconds, after which, you should walk until you catch your breath and do it again! You'll be done in 20 minutes.""'And, as always check with your health-care professional before starting any exercise program and get help using equipment properly to avoid injury.' Be physically active every day. This could be a walk after dinner, doing yard work or gardening, playing with the kids, swimming, biking, dancing, etc. Tracking the number of steps you take each day with a smartphone or fitness tracker can be very helpful. Focus on building more muscle a few times a week. "
What medications or supplements treat prediabetes?,"'Metformin is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat prediabetes. It works by stopping the ''liver'"" from producing excess glucose. For some people, metformin also helps them lose weight. It can be an option for people who aren't ready or able to make lifestyle changes right away. Metformin also is a medication that can be discontinued as soon as blood sugar levels are at goal, and healthy lifestyle habits have become routine.""'Some dietary ''supplements'' have good evidence of helping reverse prediabetes. For example, most people with prediabetes are deficient in ''vitamin D'' and magnesium. Both of these are necessary to keep cells properly sensitive to insulin. A health-care professional can order a blood test to check and see if your deficient in these and other nutrients, for example, chromium, biotin, and N-acetyl cysteine. These also are nutrients that have research supporting their role in improving insulin sensitivity.''3'' Check with a health-care professional before taking ''supplements''. You may need to find one with this specialized knowledge such as a naturopathic doctor, nutritionist, or integrative medicine doctor.'  "
What kind of doctor treats prediabetes?,"'Prediabetes is typically diagnosed and managed by your primary care practitioner, including internists and family medicine specialists, or pediatricians in the case of children or adolescents. Other specialists who may be consulted include physicians who specialize in endocrine glands and hormones including ''diabetes management'' (Endocrinologists). A nutritionist can be consulted to help you review your diet and suggest dietary and lifestyle changes. A personal trainer can be helpful if you are having a hard time putting together an exercise plan for yourself. There are a lot of self-care resources too. Eating healthier, exercising, and losing weight are ways to improve your health, and are key to prediabetes treatment.' "
Can prediabetes be prevented?,"'Absolutely! The best way to prevent prediabetes are to''If you had ''gestational diabetes'', you may want to pay special attention to adopting the habits discussed in this article.''Most importantly, for people with prediabetes, diabetes can be prevented by taking action now.' stay active, eat a healthy low glycemic index diet, and handle stress in healthy ways."
What is the prognosis for a person with prediabetes?,"""Unfortunately, most Americans with prediabetes don't make healthy changes or aren't empowered to take control of their health. Because of this, most people with prediabetes do progress to diabetes. But the good news is, and what research proves, is that with physical activity and healthier foods 58% of new cases of diabetes can be prevented."" "

Constipation,"'Many pregnant women complain of ''constipation''. Signs of ''constipation'' include having hard, dry stools; fewer than three bowel movements per week; and painful bowel movements.''Higher levels of hormones due to pregnancy slow down ''digestion'' and relax muscles in the bowels leaving many women constipated. Plus, the pressure of the expanding uterus on the bowels can contribute to constipation.''If constipation does not go away.' Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Don't drink caffeine. Eat fiber-rich foods, such as fresh or dried fruit, raw vegetables, and whole-grain cereals and breads. Try mild physical activity"
Dizziness,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''Many pregnant women complain of ''dizziness'' and ''lightheadedness'' throughout their pregnancies. ''Fainting'"" is rare but does happen even in some healthy pregnant women. There are many reasons for these symptoms.

Practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and using your bed only for sleep and sex. Go to bed a little earlier. Nap if you are not able to get enough sleep at night. Drink needed fluids earlier in the day, so you can drink less in the hours before bed."
Heartburn and indigestion,"'Hormones and the pressure of the growing uterus cause ''indigestion'' and heartburn. Pregnancy hormones slow down the muscles of the digestive tract. So food tends to move more slowly and digestion is sluggish. This causes many pregnant women to feel ''bloated''.''Hormones also relax the valve that separates the ''esophagus'' from the stomach. This allows food and acids to come back up from the stomach to the esophagus. The food and acid causes the burning feeling of heartburn. As your baby gets bigger, the uterus pushes on the stomach making heartburn more common in later pregnancy.''Call the doctor if:'""Symptoms don't improve after trying these suggestions. Ask your doctor about using an antacid.""  Eat several small meals instead of three large meals -- eat slowly. Drink fluids between meals -- not with meals. Don't eat greasy and fried foods.

Hemorrhoids during pregnancy,"'Hemorrhoids'' (HEM-roidz) are swollen and bulging veins in the rectum. They can cause itching, pain, and bleeding. Up to 50 percent of pregnant women get ''hemorrhoids''. Hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy for many reasons. During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly, which can cause veins to enlarge. The expanding uterus also puts pressure on the veins in the rectum. Plus, constipation can worsen hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids usually improve after delivery.' Drink lots of fluids. Eat fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, raw or cooked leafy green vegetables, and fruits. Try not to strain with bowel movements. Talk to your doctor about using products such as witch hazel to soothe hemorrhoids."
Itching,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''About 20 percent of pregnant women feel ''itchy'' during pregnancy. Usually women feel ''itchy'' in the abdomen. But red, itchy palms and soles of the feet are also common complaints. Pregnancy hormones and stretching skin are probably to blame for most of your discomfort. Usually the itchy feeling goes away after delivery.''Call the doctor if:'""Symptoms don't improve after a week of self-care."" Use gentle soaps and moisturizing creams. Avoid hot showers and baths. Avoid itchy fabrics."
Leg cramps,"'At different times during your pregnancy, you might have sudden ''muscle spasms'' in your legs or feet. They usually occur at night. This is due to a change in the way your body processes calcium.' Gently stretch muscles. Get mild exercise. For sudden cramps, flex your foot forward. Eat calcium-rich foods. Ask your doctor about magnesium supplements."
Morning sickness,"'In the first trimester hormone changes can cause nausea and ''vomiting''. This is called ""morning sickness,"" although it can occur at any time of day. Morning sickness usually tapers off by the second trimester.''You have ''flu-like symptoms'', which may signal a more serious condition.''You have severe, constant nausea and/or vomiting several times every day.'   Eat several small meals instead of three large meals to keep your stomach from being empty. Don't lie down after meals. Eat dry toast, saltines, or dry cereals before getting out of bed in the morning. Eat bland foods that are low in fat and easy to digest, such as cereal, rice, and bananas. Sip on water, weak tea, or clear soft drinks. Or eat ice chips. Avoid smells that upset your stomach."
Nasal problems,"'Nosebleeds'' and nasal stuffiness are common during pregnancy. They are caused by the increased amount of blood in your body and hormones acting on the tissues of your nose.''Nosebleeds'' are frequent and do not stop after a few minutes.' Blow your nose gently. Drink fluids and use a cool mist humidifier. To stop a nosebleed, squeeze your nose between your thumb and forefinger for a few minutes."
Numb or tingling hands,"'Feelings of swelling, tingling, and numbness in fingers and hands, called ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', can occur during pregnancy. These symptoms are due to ''swelling of tissues'' in the narrow passages in your wrists, and they should disappear after delivery.' Take frequent breaks to rest hands. Ask your doctor about fitting you for a splint to keep wrists straight."
"Stretch marks, skin changes","'Stretch marks are red, pink, or brown streaks on the skin. Most often they appear on the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and breasts. These ''scars'' are caused by the stretching of the skin, and usually appear in the second half of pregnancy.''Some women notice other skin changes during pregnancy. For many women, the nipples become darker and browner during pregnancy. Many pregnant women also develop a dark line (called the linea nigra) on the skin that runs from the belly button down to the pubic hairline. Patches of darker skin usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip also are common. Patches often match on both sides of the face. These spots are called ''melasma'' or chloasma and are more common in darker-skinned women.'  Be patient - stretch marks and other changes usually fade after delivery."
Swelling,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''Many women develop mild swelling in the face, hands, or ankles at some point in their pregnancies. As the due date approaches, swelling often becomes more noticeable.''Your hands or feet swell suddenly or you rapidly gain weight - it may be preeclampsia.' Drink eight to 10 glasses of fluids daily. Don't drink caffeine or eat salty foods. Rest and elevate your feet. Ask your doctor about support hose."
Urinary frequency and leaking,"'Temporary bladder control problems are common in pregnancy. Your unborn baby pushes down on the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles. This pressure can lead to more frequent need to urinate, as well as leaking of urine when ''sneezing'', ''coughing'', or laughing.' Take frequent bathroom breaks. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Do Kegel exercises to tone pelvic muscles."
Varicose veins,"'During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly. This can cause veins to enlarge. Plus, pressure on the large veins behind the uterus causes the blood to slow in its return to the heart. For these reasons, ''varicose veins'' in the legs and anus (hemorrhoids) are more common in pregnancy.''Varicose veins'' look like swollen veins raised above the surface of the skin. They can be twisted or bulging and are dark purple or blue in color. They are found most often on the backs of the calves or on the inside of the leg.' Sit with your legs and feet raised."
Introduction to natural remedies for pregnancy changes and body discomforts,"'Everyone expects pregnancy to bring an expanding waistline. But many women are surprised by the other body changes that pop up. Get the low-down on ''stretch marks'', ''weight gain'', heartburn and other ""joys"" of pregnancy. Find out what you can do to feel better.' "
Body aches,"""As your uterus expands, you may feel aches and pains in the back, abdomen, groin area, and thighs. Many women also have backaches and aching near the pelvic bone due the pressure of the baby's head, increased weight, and loosening joints. Some pregnant women complain of ""'pain'' that runs from the lower back, down the back of one leg, to the knee or foot. This is called ''sciatica'' (SYE-AT-ick-uh). It is thought to occur when the uterus puts pressure on the ''sciatic nerve''.''What might help:''Call the doctor if the ''pain'' does not get better.' Lie down Rest Apply heat"
Breast changes,"""A woman's breasts increase in size and fullness during pregnancy. As the due date approaches, hormone changes will cause your breasts to get even bigger to prepare for ""'breastfeeding''. Your breasts may feel full, heavy, or tender.''In the third trimester, some pregnant women begin to leak colostrum (coh-LOSS-truhm) from their breasts. Colostrum is the first milk that your breasts produce for the baby. It is a thick, yellowish fluid containing antibodies that protect newborns from infection.''What might help:''Tell your doctor if you feel a lump or have ''nipple'' changes or discharge (that is not colostrum) or skin changes.' Wear a maternity bra with good support. Put pads in your bra to absorb leakage."
Constipation,"'Many pregnant women complain of ''constipation''. Signs of ''constipation'' include having hard, dry stools; fewer than three bowel movements per week; and painful bowel movements.''Higher levels of hormones due to pregnancy slow down ''digestion'' and relax muscles in the bowels leaving many women constipated. Plus, the pressure of the expanding uterus on the bowels can contribute to constipation.''What might help:''Tell your doctor if constipation does not go away.'  Drink eight to 10 glasses of water daily. Don't drink caffeine. Eat fiber-rich foods such as fresh or dried fruit, raw vegetables, and whole-grain cereals and breads. Try mild physical activity."
"Fatigue, sleep problems","""During your pregnancy, you might feel tired even after you've had a lot of ""'sleep'"". Many women find they're exhausted in the ""'first trimester'"". Don't worry, this is normal! This is your body's way of telling you that you need more rest. In the ""'second trimester'', ''tiredness'"" is usually replaced with a feeling of well being and energy. But in the third trimester, exhaustion often sets in again. As you get larger, sleeping may become more difficult. The baby's movements, bathroom runs, and an increase in the body's metabolism might interrupt or disturb your sleep. Leg cramping can also interfere with a good night's sleep.""'What might help:'  Lie on your left side. Use pillows for support such as behind your back, tucked between your knees, and under your tummy. Practice good sleep habits such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and using your bed only for sleep and sex. Go to bed a little earlier. Nap if you are not able to get enough sleep at night. Drink needed fluids earlier in the day so you can drink less in the hours before bed."
Heartburn and indigestion,"'Hormones and the pressure of the growing uterus cause ''indigestion'' and heartburn. Pregnancy hormones slow down the muscles of the digestive tract. So food tends to move more slowly and digestion is sluggish. This causes many pregnant women to feel ''bloated''.''Hormones also relax the valve that separates the ''esophagus'' from the stomach. This allows food and acids to come back up from the stomach to the esophagus. The food and acid causes the burning feeling of heartburn. As your baby gets bigger, the uterus pushes on the stomach making heartburn more common in later pregnancy.''What might help:'""Call the doctor if symptoms don't improve after trying these suggestions. Ask your doctor about using an antacid."" Eat several small meals instead of three large meals - eat slowly. Drink fluids between meals - not with meals. Don't eat greasy and fried foods. Avoid citrus fruits or juices and spicy foods. Do not eat or drink within a few hours of bedtime. Do not lie down right after meals."

Is there a pre-pregnancy diet plan?,"'Women who are planning in advance to become ''pregnant'' have a great opportunity to focus on a healthy diet and get into optimum health before conceiving. Many women are encouraged to consider the 3 months before ''conception'' as a ""pre-mester"" or a trimester of pregnancy before conception. Not only does following healthy pregnancy diet plan guideline help a woman get into optimal health, it may help her conceive more easily. The father-to-be also is encouraged to follow a pre-pregnancy diet because it may help the mother-to-be stick to a healthy pregnancy eating plan.' "
What is a healthy pregnancy diet plan?,"""Myths of pregnancy such as '""""you need to eat twice as much because you're eating for two""""' or that indulging your cravings will give your baby ""'birthmarks'' are outdated and inaccurate. From a scientific perspective, there are increased nutrient demands during pregnancy, but the wisdom of the body also tells us pregnancy is a time to focus on nourishment. It is a time for the mother-to-be to focus on being as healthy as she can because that care will translate to her baby in utero. Also, establishing healthy habits now will set a positive example that will benefit the child over his or her lifetime.' The increased caloric needs during pregnancy are minimal; about 300 extra calories are needed each day. This is equivalent to three-quarters of a blueberry muffin or 2 apples or 2 ounces of 
	chocolate milk. 
	 There also are a number of micronutrients or
	vitamins that are needed in increased amounts. The increased requirements are not 
	solely due to the growth of the fetus. The changes in 
the mother's
	metabolism also contribute to the increased nutritional needs. The goal of healthy eating during pregnancy is to maximize micronutrient density. In other worlds, make sure you are getting maximum 
	nutrition out of every bite, and that you avoid ""empty"" calories. 
	 It's also important to know what foods, drinks, medications, and 
	other toxins to avoid, for example, foods that have a higher risk of food-borne illness and foods that are toxic to a developing fetus such as alcohol, mercury-containing fish, and trans
	fats1.  For many women, taking a
	prenatal multivitamin can be ""insurance"" against 
	days when they aren't able to eat much (for example, to make up for lack of 
	nutrition due to morning sickness, or not sticking to a healthy diet one 
	day); however, it is important to remember that
	supplements
supplement the 
	diet; they aren't replacements for healthy eating."
What foods are part of a pregnancy diet menu plan?,"'A well-balanced, micronutrient dense diet is the key to a healthy pregnancy. Ideally, women should start eating this way before conception, but making healthier choices at any time will always help.''A well-balanced diet should contain:''Pregnant women need more iron, ''folic acid'', calcium, zinc, iodine, and ''vitamin D'', and higher amounts of most other nutrients, than nonpregnant women. ''The US Recommended Daily Allowance''2'' sets the level of nutrient intake that is estimated to meet the nutritional needs of 97.5% of pregnant women. Malnutrition increases the risk of having a low birth weight baby or going into preterm ''labor''. Pregnant women need the following daily:''In general, women will get high levels of these nutrients by choosing a diverse, colorful diet that focuses primarily (but not entirely) on plant-based foods.' carbohydrates from whole grain sources and fruits and vegetables; protein from beans, nuts, seeds and hormone-free animal products like meat and dairy; and healthy fats such as olive oil, avocados, and the fats that occur in nuts, seeds, and fish. 600mcg of folic acid 
27 mg of iron 1000mg of calcium 11mg of zinc 220 mcg of iodine 600 IU vitamin D"
How much weight is OK to gain during pregnancy?,"'Pregnant women only need about 300 extra calories per day. While every woman is going to be different, research shows that for a normal weight woman (''BMI'' 18.5 – 25), the optimal pregnancy total ''weight gain'' is about 25-35 pounds''7''. Larger women will gain less and smaller women gain more. All women should decrease their focus on weight and focus on the quality of their diet, ensuring good nutrition.''During the first and second ''trimesters'', weight gain manifests as an increase in maternal fat stores, plus a 60% increase in blood volume. Later in pregnancy, more of the weight gain is due to the fetal growth, ''amniotic fluid'', breast development, and placenta. Overweight women sometimes even experience ''weight loss'' during the ''first trimester'' and slowly gain a small amount over the second and third trimesters. There is no minimum amount of weight an overweight woman needs to gain as long as she is eating micronutrient dense foods and fetal growth is on track.'  BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (underweight) - typically gain 28 to 40 lbs. BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (optimal weight) - typically gain 25 to 35 lbs. BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 (overweight) - typically gain 15 to 25 lbs. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 (obese) - typically gain 11 to 20 lbs."
Is it OK to diet during pregnancy?,"""Regardless of the weight of the woman when she becomes pregnant, it isn't a good idea to diet during pregnancy. Research from famines during World War II in Europe have taught us about the epigenetic implications of restriction during pregnancy. ""'Epigenetics'"" describes the impact of the prenatal environment on the genetic programming of the child that stays with them for life. In fact, the prenatal environment has an impact on the developing ovaries and eggs in the female fetus, having an impact on the next generation too! A mother's nutritional choices during pregnancy can affect her grandchildren!""'During the famines in World War II, pregnant Dutch women lived on less than 900 calories a day for a winter and their metabolism became very efficient at storing energy. When the war ended and food supplies returned to normal, and the ''babies'' were born, the women and their babies had normal calorie intake. However, those babies were far more likely to go on to become obese or develop ''diabetes'' because their genes were influenced during the time of scarcity. In the same way, ''dieting'' during pregnancy can have unintentionally metabolic consequences on the genetic programming of the infant that will stay with them for life.''While ''dieting'' (restricting calories) during pregnancy is discouraged, eating a healthier diet by removing extra ''sugar'' and processed foods is an excellent idea. This is the type of ""diet"" I put all my patients on. The focus should be on high quality nutrition, optimizing micronutrient intake, and minimizing empty calories.' "
Low carb diet menu plans during pregnancy,"'Low carbohydrate diets can be healthy during pregnancy, as they are for any life phase, but the devil is in the details, as they say. More precise than simply a low carb diet, glycemic load diet is beneficial during pregnancy (and throughout life). Glycemic load is a term that measures how quickly a carbohydrate is digested and turned into blood ''sugar''. Carbohydrates with lots of ''fiber'', or combined with fat or protein have lower glycemic loads and raise blood sugar slowly, providing steady energy and preventing a spike in blood sugar and the subsequent ''low blood sugar'' drop. How do you follow a low glycemic load diet? ''Choose carbohydrates in their unrefined (less processed) form:''An easy way to do this is to stay away from ""white"" foods:''White foods are also low in micronutrients.

Vegetarian and vegan diet menu plans during pregnancy,"'Pregnant women can absolutely follow vegan or ''vegetarian'' diets during pregnancy. In fact, doing so may help them avoid some of the added hormones that are common in non-organic animal products. However, there are some nutrients that are commonly deficient in vegetarian diets. Pregnant women who are vegan or vegetarian should be extra careful to ensure they are getting enough calcium, iron, and B-12. Protein intake needs to be monitored too. ''Vegetarian protein sources include:''These last three are not part of a vegan pregnancy diet, but are appropriate for a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet.''B-12 is needed for proper DNA expression in the growing embryo and fetus. Deficiencies cause ''anemia'' and are associated with low birth weight, pre-term delivery, ''preeclampsia'', and ''neural tube defects''8''. Pregnant women need 30mcg a day according to the Recommended Daily Allowance, and the sources are all animal-based. Vegan women may want to ensure they get enough by taking a methylcobalamin supplement. Other B ''vitamins'', specifically folate and B6, are important in pregnancy.

Protein needs during pregnancy,"""Protein requirements in pregnancy are increased by 50%. On average, a pregnant woman needs about 70 grams of protein per day. Protein will not only ensure good growth of the baby, it will help keep the mother's blood sugar stable and may help reduce morning sickness. Research studies have shown better birth outcomes (fewer underweight or early babies) when a mother's daily diet is at least 25% protein. Most people think of meat when they think about protein, but there are many excellent vegetarian sources. A vegan or vegetarian pregnancy diet can easily get enough protein from bean, nut, and grain sources.  Additionally, relying only meat sources can increase your intake of saturated fat and other components of meat that are wise to limit in the diet. Here are some examples of good sources of healthy proteins."" 1 egg, 6g 1 c Greek yogurt, 14g 11 c edamame, 29g 2T hummus, 9g 2T almond butter, 8g 1c cooked spinach, 5g 3.5oz chicken breast, 30g 3.5 oz. fish, 22g 1 scoop protein powder, 14g 1 c beans, 18g 1 oz. nuts, 6g 1 c cooked quinoa, 8g"
Iron needs during pregnancy,"'Iron is a common deficiency during pregnancy. Iron is an essential mineral needed to transport oxygen to tissues. It is also necessary for DNA repair and mitochondrial energy production. Insufficient iron can cause ''anemia'' and symptoms of:''Anemia has been linked to pre-term births, low birth weight, and even ''autism'' and increased maternal mortality''10'"". Thus, it's really important to get enough iron during pregnancy. The RDA for iron is 27mg during pregnancy; your obstetrician or ""'midwife'' may recommend 40mg per day to correct a deficiency. Cooking in cast-iron skillets can also increase iron intake – you can add 5mg of additional iron for each per saucy, ''vitamin C''-rich dish you cook in cast iron.''These are some good food sources of iron:' fatigue, pallor, hair loss, poor exercise tolerance, restless legs, and poor cognitive development in children. 3 oz. canned clams, 24mg 1 packet instant oatmeal, 11mg 1 oz.

Folate needs during pregnancy,"'Folate occurs naturally in vegetables and whole grains but it is lost in the processing of refined grains.\xa0 Folate deficiency increases the risk of congenital anomalies, most notably neural tube defects such as ''spina bifida'"". For this reason, it's one of the most serious nutritional deficiencies in pregnancy. Unfortunately, the critical time for neural tube development occurs in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she's pregnant and thus when she is less likely to be taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid or getting enough in the diet. Because of this, fortification of grain products (adding back in what was lost in processing) was mandated in 1998, and the prevalence of neural tube defects has dropped dramatically. Unfortunately, these foods are fortified with synthetic folic acid, not folate, and a very common genetic variant of the MTHFR gene (that codes for an enzyme important in processing of amino acids), makes it difficult for people to convert folic acid to useable folate and pregnant women with this variant are at particular risk. Researchers have suggested it would be much better to supplement pregnant women, and enrich food, with the active form methyltetrahydrofolate, rather than folic acid""'11''. Fortunately, pregnant women can get the necessary 600mcg of active, natural form folate from these dietary sources:' 1 cup of black-eyed peas, 356mcg 1 cup lentils, 358mcg 1 cup asparagus, 268mcg 1 cup cubed avocado, 122mcg 3 oz. romaine lettuce, 116mcg 1 c broccoli, 55mcg 1c beets, 135mcg 1c papaya, 116mcg"
Calcium needs during pregnancy,"'Calcium is critical for developing bones. It also reduces the risk of pre-''eclampsia'' and ''hypertension''. Women who get enough calcium during pregnancy have a 35% lower risk of ''high blood pressure'' and a 55% lower risk of ''preeclampsia'"". If the mother isn't getting enough additional calcium in the diet, the fetus will still get enough, but it will come from the reserves in the mother's bones.

In addition to the negative outcomes of low birth weight, early delivery, and preeclampsia that result from deficiency, zinc is important for the immune system of the mother and baby. Iron competes with zinc for absorption, so women who are supplementing with extra iron also need to make sure they are getting extra zinc. Some food sources are:' 4 oz. mushrooms, 11mg 4 oz. beef or lamb, 6mg ¼ c sesame or pumpkin seeds, 3mg 1 cup green peas, 2 mg 3 oz. 
	shellfish (mussels, clams, oysters), 75 mg"
Vitamin D needs and pregnancy,"'Pregnant women need 600 IU of vitamin D according to the USDA RDA guidelines; however, many experts believe this estimate is far too low. Humans synthesize vitamin D from sun exposure and there are very few food sources. Additionally, factors such as skin pigmentation, ''obesity'', and ''sunscreen'"" usage impact the ability to make vitamin D from sunlight. In clinical practice, I measure patients' blood levels of vitamin D and find that many are deficient even if they are taking a 2000mcg vitamin D3 supplement every day. Pregnant women who are concerned about vitamin D can consult a midwife, naturopathic midwife, or obstetrician who is willing to test their vitamin D levels so they know how much they need. Here are a few food sources:"" 4 oz. salmon, 411 IU 3 oz. canned sardines, 231 IU 8 oz. fortified soy milk, 100 IU 8 oz. fortified cow milk, 98 IU 1 egg, 23 IU 1 cup mushrooms, 114 IU"
"Are supplements, herbs, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications safe to take 
during pregnancy?"," Pregnant women should take a good quality prenatal multivitamin that includes 
natural folate/methylfolate and iron. Most pregnant women may need supplemental vitamin D based on blood tests. Supplements should remain supplemental to a healthy diet and if the diet includes fruits and vegetables at every meal, most nutritional needs should be met. Some supplements and herbs can also be useful to manage some of the 
	symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness. 
	Ginger and vitamin B6 both have been studied and found helpful for 
	nausea in some women14,15. While commonly used, some over the counter medications that have been recommended for 
	nausea, like 
	antihistamines, actually make it worse for some people16. Magnesium is helpful for 
	constipation, and may reduce the risks of developing pre-eclampsia and other poor birth outcomes17. Herbals teas such as raspberry leaf, 
	lemon balm, and chamomile have been traditionally used during pregnancy and are safe to consume, although mint can exacerbate 
	heartburn, so use with care. Women should discuss all of the medications, supplements, and herbs with their midwife or obstetrician."
What foods and exercise help morning sickness and heartburn symptoms?," While bland carbohydrates are commonly recommended for morning sickness and heartburn, studies have actually shown that protein helps more. 
	 Eat a low glycemic-load, healthy pregnancy diet to minimize the risks of feeling poorly. Eat regularly to keep blood sugars stable to minimize nausea. Make sure to consume enough water to stay hydrated and to keep bowels moving regularly. Exercise should be regular and not more vigorous that what the woman was used to before pregnancy. 
	 Long walks, prenatal yoga classes, and stretching are all excellent options for exercise while pregnant. 
	 Research has shown that all types of physical activity are safe in pregnancy except scuba diving, and extra care should be taken to avoid falling. 
	 Other healthy habits to help troublesome pregnancy symptoms include getting outside for fresh air, and ensuring good sleep also make a difference for both the pregnant woman and her baby."
What about a post pregnancy diet?," After delivery, the best diet is one that meets the nutritional needs of breastfeeding and helps the mother gradually return to her pre-pregnancy weight. 
	 Breastfeeding requires about 500 calories per day, so many women lose excess weight quickly. The nutritional needs of breast feeding require extra calcium and protein. 
	 Women also should be prepared for irregular meal patterns as they may be sleeping and awake at odd hours over the first few months as the baby's needs for nursing and sleeping evolve. 
	 New mothers shouldn't be focused on weight loss through calorie restriction while breastfeeding. Instead, they should continue the nutrient-dense diet recommended during pregnancy, and focus on increasing physical activity to accelerate a return to pre-pregnancy weight."
"What foods, drinks, or medicatons should be avoided during pregnancy?","'Pregnant women should stay away from several categories of unsafe foods:''Common bacteria pose a greater risk to pregnant women and their fetus, so extra precautions should be followed.''Some of the man-made food additives are known to cause problems and should be avoided. For example, trans fats cross the maternal/fetal barrier, and are absorbed by fetus and may cause adverse effects on cellular membrane structure.''6'' Although limited research is available to quantify the risks of artificial sweeteners in pregnancy, they are able to cross the placenta into the fetal circulation and are typically found in nutrient-poor, processed foods that should be limited regardless.''Illicit ''drugs'', some ''over-the-counter'' (OTC), and many prescription drugs should also be avoided. If you are having trouble stopping taking illicit drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, talk to your midwife or obstetrician to get help specifically for pregnant women right away. There is help. ''Medications, either OTC or prescription, can be harmful to the fetus; double check with your health-care professional or look up the ""Pregnancy Class"" of the medication before taking it. ' ones that have a higher likelihood of being contaminated with bacteria, ones that are toxic to the fetus, and ones that simply 
	add calories without adding nutrition. Listeria, salmonella and toxoplasmosis are examples of bacterial infections that should be prevented in pregnancy. These infections can increase the risk of miscarriage, damage to fetal brain development and other organs. 
Infections also put the mother at risk with symptoms like diarrhea, dehydration, and fever. To minimize risk, make sure meats are fully cooked and stay away from raw or undercooked meat and seafood. No sushi during pregnancy! Deli meats, meat spreads, and smoked lox are also questionable and should be heated to steaming hot in order to kill any bacteria. Dairy products can also be a source of bacterial contamination. This is why pregnant women are encouraged to stay away from soft unpasteurized cheeses. The important part to remember is that 
pasteurizing (flash heating) foods kills bacteria; for example, pasteurized Brie would be fine. Vegetables and fruit aren't immune to bacterial contamination that occurs during the harvesting or preparation process. Toxoplasma is present in the soil and can contaminate vegetables. Always wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. 
Washing them with a water and white vinegar mixture can be more effective then a 
pure water wash. Alcohol, in any amount, should be avoided. There is no known safe amount of intake, and drinking alcohol puts the fetus at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and associated developmental problems. Caffeine, whether from coffee, soda, or tea, has been associated with decreased birth weight4. Some fish, such as tuna, are high in mercury 
and should be avoided. Mercury is neurotoxic and can impede fetal brain development. Pregnant women should avoid fish that are potentially high in mercury. Some fish are known to be low in mercury (for example, salmon and sardines). In general long lived fish, high on the food chain will contain higher mercury levels. A guide to selecting safe fish can be found at Natural Resources Defense Council's Sustainable Seafood Guide.5 Uncooked/undercooked animal products (like sushi and rare meat), including eggs Unpasteurized dairy products (like soft cheeses) Tuna, lake fish, and other high mercury fish Alcohol Caffeine (in coffee, tea, or soda) Trans fats (anything labeled hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated) Artificial sweeteners Certain drugs"
Is it safe to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'There is no clear-cut answer to this question. Before you start or stop any medicine, it is always best to speak with the doctor who is caring for you while you are ''pregnant''. Read on to learn about deciding to use medicine while pregnant.' "
How should I decide whether to use a medicine while I am pregnant?,"'When deciding whether or not to use a medicine in ''pregnancy'"", you and your doctor need to talk about the medicine's benefits and risks.""'There may be times during pregnancy when using medicine is a choice. Some of the medicine choices you and your doctor make while you are pregnant may differ from the choices you make when you are not pregnant. For example, if you get a ''cold'', you may decide to ""live with"" your stuffy nose instead of using the ""stuffy nose"" medicine you use when you are not pregnant.''Other times, using medicine is not a choice - it is needed. Some women need to use medicines while they are pregnant. Sometimes, women need medicine for a few days or a couple of weeks to treat a problem like a''bladder infection'' or ''strep throat''. Other women need to use medicine every day to control long-term health problems like ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''depression'', or ''seizures''. Also, some women have a pregnancy problem that needs medicine treatment. These problems include severe''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', earlier pregnancy losses, or preterm ''labor''.' Benefits: what are the good things the medicine can do for me and my growing baby (fetus)? 
	 Risks: what are the ways the medicine might harm me or my growing baby (fetus)?"
Where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?,"'Doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages, textbooks, and research journals. They also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines.'""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the part of our country's government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the United States. The FDA lets a company sell a medicine in the United States if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. Companies that make medicines usually have to show FDA doctors and scientists whether ""'birth defects'' or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. Most of the time, ''drugs'' are not studied in pregnant women.''The FDA works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. But in most cases, there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing ''babies''. Many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. But a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. Here is an example:''A medicine is given to pregnant rats. If the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies, it may or may not cause problems in human babies. If there are no problems in the rat babies, it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies.The FDA asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. This improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies.\t'""There is a lot that FDA doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. In a perfect world, every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. Unfortunately, this is not the case."" "
What are examples of prescription medications that are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Doctors use information from many sources when they choose medicine for a patient, including medicine labels. To help doctors, the FDA created pregnancy letter categories to help explain what is known about using medicine during pregnancy. This system assigns letter categories to all prescription medicines. The letter category is listed in the label of a prescription medicine. The label states whether studies were done in pregnant women or pregnant animals and if so, what happened. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines do not have a pregnancy letter category. Some OTC medicines were prescription medicines first and used to have a letter category. Talk to your doctor and follow the instructions on the label before taking OTC medicines.'""The FDA chooses a medicine's letter category based on what is known about the medicine when used in pregnant women and animals.""'The FDA is working hard to gather more knowledge about using medicine during pregnancy. The FDA is also trying to make medicine labels more helpful to doctors. Medicine label information for prescription medicines is now changing, and the pregnancy part of the label will change over the next few years.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Keep in mind that other things like ''caffeine'', ''vitamins'', and herbal remedies can affect the growing fetus. Talk with your doctor about cutting down on ''caffeine'' and ask which type of vitamin you should take. Never use an herbal product without talking to your doctor first.''All OTC medicines have a Drug Facts label. The Drug Facts label is arranged the same way on all OTC medicines. This makes information about using the medicine easier to find. One section of the Drug Facts label is for pregnant women. With OTC medicines, the label usually tells a pregnant woman to speak with her doctor before using the medicine. Some OTC medicines are known to cause certain problems in pregnancy. The labels for these medicines give pregnant women facts about why and when they should not use the medicine. Here are some examples:''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''®, ''Motrin''®), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''®), and ''aspirin'' (acetylsalicylate), can cause serious blood flow problems in the baby if used during the last third of pregnancy (after 28 weeks). Also, aspirin may increase the chance for bleeding problems in the mother and the baby during pregnancy or at delivery.''The labels for ''nicotine'' therapy drugs, like the ''nicotine patch'' and lozenge, remind women that ''smoking'' can harm an unborn child. While the medicine is thought to be safer than ''smoking'', the risks of the medicine are not fully known. Pregnant ''smokers'' are told to try quitting without the medicine first.' "
What if I'm thinking about getting pregnant?,"'If you are not pregnant yet, you can help your chances for having a healthy baby by planning ahead. Schedule a pre-pregnancy checkup. At this visit, you can talk to your doctor about the medicines, ''vitamins'', and herbs you use. It is very important that you keep treating your health problems while you are pregnant. Your doctor can tell you if you need to switch your medicine. Ask about vitamins for women who are trying to get pregnant. All women who can get pregnant should take a daily vitamin with ''folic acid'' (a B vitamin) to prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. You should begin taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. It is also a good idea to discuss caffeine, ''alcohol'', and ''smoking'' with your doctor at this time.' "
Is it safe to use medicine while I am trying to become pregnant?,"'It is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. Once you do get pregnant, you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. Before you start trying to get pregnant, it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. Sometimes, medicines should be changed, and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. Each woman is different. So you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own.' Do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. 
	 Talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.
	"
What if I get sick and need to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'Whether or not you should use medicine during pregnancy is a serious question to discuss with your doctor. Some health problems need treatment. Not using a medicine that you need could harm you and your baby. For example, a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') that is not treated may become a ''kidney infection''. Kidney infections can cause preterm ''labor'' and low birth weight. An antibiotic is needed to get rid of a ''UTI''. Ask your doctor whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks for you and your baby.' "
Should you stop taking medications during pregnancy if you have health problems?,"'If you are pregnant or thinking about ''becoming pregnant'', you should talk to your doctor about your medicines. Do not stop or change them on your own. This includes medicines for ''depression'', ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''seizures'' (''epilepsy''), and other health problems. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine.''For women living with ''HIV'', the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends using ''zidovudine'' (AZT) during pregnancy. Studies show that ''HIV'' positive women who use AZT during pregnancy greatly lower the risk of passing ''HIV'' to their babies. If a diabetic woman does not use her medicine during pregnancy, she raises her risk for ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', and some birth defects. If ''asthma'' and ''high blood pressure'' are not controlled during pregnancy, problems with the fetus may result.' "
Are vitamins safe for me while I am pregnant?,"'Regular ''multivitamins'' and ''prenatal vitamins'' are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or ''prenatal'' vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms (µg) of folic acid. It is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. Folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect, like ''spina bifida'', where the spine or brain does not form the right way. See our information on Folic Acid. Iron can help prevent a low blood count (''anemia'""). It's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. Too many vitamins can harm your baby. For example, very high levels of ""'vitamin A'' have been linked with severe birth defects.''''Vaccines'' and Pregnancy''''''Vaccines'' protect your body against dangerous diseases. Some ''vaccines'' are not safe to receive during pregnancy. For some vaccines, the decision to give a ''vaccine'"" during pregnancy depends on a pregnant woman's own situation. Her doctor may consider these questions before giving a vaccine:""'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that ''Hepatitis B'' vaccination should be considered when women are at risk for developing''Hepatitis B'' during pregnancy, and inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine  should be considered for women who are pregnant during ''flu'' season. On the other hand, a pregnant woman who is not immune to ''rubella'' (''German measles'') is not given a ''rubella'' vaccine until after pregnancy. Talk with your doctor to make sure you are fully protected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides ''vaccine guidelines for pregnant women''.'   Is there is a high chance she will be exposed to the disease?  Would the infection pose a risk to the mother or fetus?  Is the vaccine unlikely to cause harm? "
Are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when I am pregnant?,"'Except for some vitamins, little is known about using ''dietary supplements'' while pregnant. Some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. But, most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. Talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. These products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy.''In the United States, there are different laws for medicines and for dietary ''supplements''. The part of the FDA that controls dietary ''supplements'' is the same part that controls foods sold in the United States. Only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before October 15, 1994, submit safety information for review by the FDA. However, unlike medicines, herbal remedies and ""natural products"" are not approved by the FDA for safety or for what they say they will do. Most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus, let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. Before a company can sell a medicine, the company must complete many studies and send the results to the FDA. Many scientists and doctors at the FDA check the study results. The FDA allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.' "
"In the future, will there be better ways to know if medicines are safe to use during pregnancy?","'At this time, drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. Until this changes, pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. A pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. The women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. Researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. This type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. A woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant.''If you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant, check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine.

What should I know about ectopic pregnancy?,"'An ''ectopic pregnancy'' is a ''pregnancy'' located outside the inner lining of the uterus. The Fallopian tubes are the most common locations for an ectopic pregnancy.''The three symptoms (characteristics) of ectopic pregnancy are ''abdominal pain'', absence of menstrual periods (''amenorrhea''), and ''vaginal bleeding''. However, only about 50% of women have all three of these symptoms.''Ectopic or ''tubal pregnancy'' is caused when a fertilized egg lodges in a Fallopian tube or other location instead of continuing its journey to the uterus, where it is supposed to implant. The egg can become stuck when a Fallopian tube is damaged, scarred, or distorted.''Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include previous ectopic ''pregnancies'' and conditions (surgery, infection) that disrupt the normal anatomy of the Fallopian tubes. The major health risk of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to ''internal bleeding''.''Ectopic pregnancy occurs in 1%-2% of all pregnancies.''Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is usually established by blood hormone tests and pelvic ''ultrasound''.''Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include both surgery and medication.'  "
What is the medical definition of ectopic pregnancy?,'An ectopic pregnancy is an early pregnancy that occurs outside of the normal location (uterine lining) for a developing pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy cannot progress normally and typically results in the death of the embryo or fetus.' 
What is an ectopic pregnancy? What does an ectopic pregnancy look like (picture)?,"'An ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a condition in which a fertilized egg settles and grows in any location other than the inner lining of the uterus. The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies are so-called tubal pregnancies and occur in the Fallopian tube. However, they can occur in other locations, such as the ovary, cervix, and abdominal ''cavity''. An ectopic pregnancy occurs in about one in 1%-2% of all pregnancies. A molar pregnancy differs from an ectopic pregnancy in that it is usually a mass of tissue derived from an egg with incomplete genetic information that grows in the uterus in a grape-like mass that can cause symptoms to those of pregnancy.''The major health risk of ectopic pregnancy is rupture leading to internal bleeding. Before the 19th century, the mortality rate (death rate) from ectopic pregnancies exceeded 50%. By the end of the 19th century, the mortality rate dropped to five percent because of surgical intervention. Statistics suggest that with current advances in early detection, the mortality rate has improved to less than five in 10,000. The survival rate from ectopic pregnancies is improving even though the incidence of ectopic pregnancies is also increasing. The major reason for a poor outcome is failure to seek early medical attention. Ectopic pregnancy remains the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.''In rare cases, an ectopic pregnancy may occur at the same time as an intrauterine pregnancy. This is referred to as heterotopic pregnancy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has risen in recent years due to the increasing use of ''IVF'' (''in vitro fertilization'') and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs).''For additional diagrams and photos, please see the last reference listed below.' "
What are the early and later signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy?,"'The woman may not be aware that she is ''pregnant''. The three classic signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include ''abdominal pain'', the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and ''vaginal bleeding'' or intermittent bleeding (''spotting''). The however, about 50% of females with an ectopic pregnancy will not have all three signs. These characteristic symptoms occur in ruptured ectopic pregnancies (those accompanied by severe internal bleeding) and non-ruptured ectopic pregnancies. However, while these symptoms are typical for an ectopic pregnancy, they do not mean an ectopic pregnancy is necessarily present and could represent other conditions. In fact, these symptoms also occur with a threatened abortion (''miscarriage'') in nonectopic pregnancies.''The signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy typically occur six to eight weeks after the last normal ''menstrual period'', but they may occur later if the ectopic pregnancy is not located in the Fallopian tube. Other ''symptoms of pregnancy'' (for example, ''nausea'' and breast discomfort, etc.) may also be present in ectopic pregnancy. ''Weakness'', ''dizziness'', and a sense of passing out upon standing can (also termed near-''syncope'') be signs of serious internal bleeding and ''low blood pressure'' from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and require immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, some women with a bleeding ectopic pregnancy do not recognize they have symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Their diagnosis is delayed until the woman shows signs of ''shock'' (for example, ''low blood pressure'', weak and rapid pulse, ''pale skin'' and ''confusion'') and often is brought to an emergency department.'' This situation is a medical emergency.'  "
What are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Age:'' Ectopic pregnancy can occur in any woman, of any age, who is ovulating and is sexually active with a male partner. The highest likelihood ectopic pregnancy occurs in women aged 35-44 years.''History:'' The greatest risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy is a prior history of an ectopic pregnancy.''Fallopian tube abnormalities:'' Any disruption of the normal architecture of the Fallopian tubes can be a risk factor for a tubal pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy in other locations.''Previous gynecological surgeries:'' Previous surgery on the Fallopian tubes such as tubal sterilization or reconstructive, procedures can lead to scarring and disruption of the normal anatomy of the tubes and increases the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.''Infections:'' Infection in the pelvis (''pelvic inflammatory disease'') is another risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic infections are usually caused by sexually-transmitted organism, such as ''Chlamydia'' or ''N. gonorrhoeae'', the bacteria that cause ''gonorrhea''. However, non-sexually transmitted bacteria can also cause pelvic infection and increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Infection causes an ectopic pregnancy by damaging or obstructing the Fallopian tubes. Normally, the inner lining of the Fallopian tubes is coated with small hair-like projections called cilia. These cilia are important to transport the egg smoothly from the ovary through the Fallopian tube and into the uterus. If these cilia are damaged by infection, egg transport becomes disrupted. The fertilized egg can settle in the Fallopian tube without reaching the uterus, thus becoming an ectopic pregnancy. Likewise, infection-related scarring and partial blockage of the Fallopian tubes can also prevent the egg from reaching the uterus.''Multiple sex partners:'"" Because having multiple sexual partners increases a woman's risk of pelvic infections, multiple sexual partners also are associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.""'Gynecological conditions:'' Like pelvic infections, conditions such as ''endometriosis'', ''fibroid'' tumors, or pelvic ''scar tissue'' (pelvic adhesions), can narrow the Fallopian tubes and disrupt egg transportation, thereby increasing the chances of an ectopic pregnancy.''IUD'' use:'' Approximately half of pregnancies in women using intrauterine devices (IUDs) will be located outside of the uterus. However, the total number of women ''becoming pregnant'' while using IUDs is extremely low. Therefore, the overall number of ectopic pregnancies related to IUDs is very low.''Cigarette smoking'':'' ''Cigarette smoking'' around the time of ''conception'"" has also been associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. This risk was observed to be dose-dependent, which means that the risk is dependent upon the individual woman's habits and increases with the number of cigarettes smoked.""'Infertility'':'' A history of ''infertility'' for two or more years also is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.'""Other causes: Infection, congenital abnormalities, or tumors of the Fallopian tubes can increase a woman's risk of having an ectopic pregnancy.""  "
Is there a test to diagnose ectopic pregnancy?,"'The first step in the diagnosis is an interview and examination by the doctor. The usual second step is to obtain a qualitative (positive or negative for pregnancy) or quantitative (measures hormone levels) ''pregnancy test''. Occasionally, the doctor may feel a tender mass during the pelvic examination. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the combination of blood hormone ''pregnancy tests'' and pelvic ultrasound can usually help to establish the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is the most useful test to visualize an ectopic pregnancy. In this test, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina, and pelvic images are visible on a monitor. Transvaginal ultrasound can reveal the gestational sac in either a normal (intrauterine) pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy, but often the findings are not conclusive. Rather than a gestational sac containing a visible embryo, the examination may simply reveal a mass in the area of the Fallopian tubes or elsewhere that is suggestive of, but not conclusive for, an ectopic pregnancy. The ultrasound can also demonstrate the absence of pregnancy within the uterus.''Pregnancy tests are designed to detect specific hormones; the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta HCG) blood levels are also used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Beta HCG levels normally rise during pregnancy. An abnormal pattern in the rise of this hormone can be a clue to the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. In rare cases, ''laparoscopy'' may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. During laparoscopy, viewing instruments are inserted through small incisions in the abdominal wall to visualize the structures in the abdomen and pelvis, thereby revealing the site of the ectopic pregnancy.'  "
Is an ectopic pregnancy dangerous? Can you die from it?,"'Some women spontaneously absorb the fetus from the ectopic pregnancy, and have no apparent side effects. In these instances, the woman can be observed without treatment. However, the true incidence of spontaneous resolution of ectopic pregnancies is unknown. It is not possible to predict which women will spontaneously resolve their ectopic pregnancies.''The most feared complication of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to internal bleeding, pelvic and ''abdominal pain'', shock, and even death. Therefore, bleeding in an ectopic pregnancy may require immediate surgical attention. Bleeding results from the rupture of the Fallopian tube or from blood leaking from the end of the tube as the growing placenta erodes into the veins and arteries located inside the tubal wall. Blood coming from the tube can be very irritating to other tissues and organs in the pelvis and abdomen, and result in significant ''pain''. The pelvic blood can lead to ''scar'' tissue formation that can result in problems with becoming pregnant in the future. The scar tissue can also increase the risk of future ectopic pregnancies.''Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are the specialists who typically treat ectopic pregnancies. However, ''emergency medicine'' specialists and surgeons treat ruptured ectopic pregnancies. If you think you may have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy go to your nearest emergency room right away.' "
What are the treatments for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include observation, laparoscopy, laparotomy, and medication. Selection of these options is individualized. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve on their own without the need for any intervention, while others will need urgent surgery due to life-threatening bleeding. However, because of the risk of rupture and potential dire consequences, most women with a diagnosed ectopic pregnancy are treated with medications or surgery.''For those who require intervention, the most common treatment is surgery. Two surgical options are available; laparotomy and laparoscopy. Laparotomy is an open procedure whereby a transverse (bikini line) incision is made across the lower abdomen. Laparoscopy involves inserting viewing instruments into the pelvis through tiny incisions in the skin. For many surgeons and patients, laparoscopy is preferred over laparotomy because of the tiny incisions used and the speedy recovery afterwards. Under optimal conditions, a small incision can be made in the Fallopian tube and the ectopic pregnancy removed, leaving the Fallopian tube intact. However, certain conditions make laparoscopy less effective or unavailable as an alternative. These include massive pelvic scar tissue and excessive blood in the abdomen or pelvis. In some instances, the location or extent of damage may require removal of a portion of the Fallopian tube, the entire tube, the ovary, and even the uterus.'  "
What medications treat ectopic pregnancy? Can an ectopic pregnancy go full term?,"'Medical therapy can also be successful in treating certain groups of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. Medical treatment method involves the use of an anti-''cancer'' drug called ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). This drug acts by killing the growing cells of the placenta, thereby inducing miscarriage of the ectopic pregnancy. Some patients may not respond to methotrexate, and will require surgical treatment. Methotrexate is gaining popularity because of its high success rate and low rate of side effects.''There are certain factors, including the size of the mass associated with the ectopic pregnancy and the blood beta HCG concentrations that help doctors decide which women are candidates for medical rather than surgical treatment. The optimal candidates for methotrexate treatment are women with a beta-subunit (HCG) concentration less than or equal to 5000 mIU/mL. In a properly selected patient population, methotrexate therapy is about 90% effective in treating ectopic pregnancy. There is no evidence that the use of this drug causes any adverse effects in subsequent pregnancies. Additional tests (HCG) are usually ordered to confirm that methotrexate treatment is effective.''Although there have been a few reported cases of women giving birth by cesarean section to live infants that were located outside the uterus, this is extremely rare. The chance of carrying an ectopic pregnancy to full term is so remote, and the risk to the woman so great, that it can never be recommended. It would be ideal if an ectopic pregnancy in the Fallopian tube could be saved by surgery to relocate it into the uterus. This concept has yet to become accepted as a successful procedure. Overall, there have been great advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy, and the death rate from this condition has decreased dramatically.' "

What are preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia is a condition that can develop during pregnancy characterized by ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') and protein in the urine (proteinuria). If not properly recognized and managed, preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia, which is defined as the development of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. Eclampsia is serious for both mother and baby and can even be fatal. Preeclampsia was formerly known as toxemia of pregnancy. Without treatment, it has been estimated that 1 out of 200 cases of preeclampsia will progress to seizures (eclampsia). Estimates of the incidence of preeclampsia range from 2% to 7% in healthy women who have never before given birth.''Preeclampsia occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and can occur during the days following birth. Some reports describe preeclampsia as occurring up to 4 to 6 weeks after birth, although most cases of postpartum preeclampsia occur within 48 hours of delivery. A mahority of cases occur after the 34th week of gestation, and 6% occur after birth.''Preeclampsia and eclampsia are most common in first-time ''pregnancies''. Pregnant teens and women over 40 are also at increased risk.' "
What causes preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'The exact cause of preeclampsia and eclampsia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a disorder of the lining of blood vessels. Abnormalities of the placenta have also been described. It likely arises due to a combination of factors, including both genetic and environmental influences. A number of genes have been studied as being potentially involved in preeclampsia, and there is an increased risk for women with affected family members. Nutritional factors, ''obesity'', and the immune system may also play a role in its development although this is not yet fully understood. Some studies of the immune response in preeclampsia have shown problems in the way certain cells of the immune system interact with each other to regulate the immune response.'  "
Who is at risk for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"""Different factors can increase a woman's risk for developing preeclampsia and eclampsia. These include:"" Age: Teens or women over 40 are at 
greatest risk History of preeclampsia/eclampsia in a 
previous pregnancy Obesity Having had high blood pressure prior to 
pregnancy Pregnancy achieved through egg donation 
or donor insemination Having a mother or sister who had 
preeclampsia Having certain diseases, like diabetes, 
 lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or some kidney diseases Multiple gestation Sickle cell disease"
What are the symptoms of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Most women with mild preeclampsia do not have any symptoms.''Other symptoms and signs that can occur with severe preeclampsia include\xa0''Symptoms of eclampsia include those of preeclampsia along with the development of seizures. When seizures occur, they are most often preceded by neurological symptoms like ''headache'' and vision disturbances. Women with severe preeclampsia may have a reduced ''platelet count'' (below 100,000).''Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia go away within 1 to 6 weeks after delivery of the baby.'   The hallmark signs, as mentioned previously, are the presence of protein in the urine and elevated blood pressure. Swelling of the feet, legs, and hands is also common, but this can occur in normal pregnancy and is not necessarily related to preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia may experience sudden weight gain over 1 to 2 days. dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, vision changes, changes in reflexes, altered mental state, fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and a decrease in urine output."
How are preeclampsia and eclampsia diagnosed?,"'Preeclampsia may be diagnosed at a regular pregnancy health screening.''Recent research has shown that Congo red (CR) ''spotting'' tests may be better indicators of preeclampsia than standard urine dipstick tests for proteinuria. The test is based on the fact that the urine and placentas of women with preeclampsia contain abnormally folded proteins that bind to the Congo red stain. Since preeclampsia may be asymptomatic (produce no symptoms), it is important for pregnant women to have routine health checkups. Tests to monitor the health of mother and baby will also be ordered.''There are no predictive tests to show whether or not a woman will develop preeclampsia.' Protein in the urine is diagnosed by urinalysis, and blood pressure measurements taken in the clinic may show elevated values. Blood pressure in preeclampsia is usually over 140/90. Blood tests, such as blood cell counts and tests for blood clotting ability, can also be done."
What is the treatment for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'There is no cure for preeclampsia and eclampsia other than delivery of the baby. The decision about whether to induce ''labor'' or perform a Cesarean section depends upon the severity of the condition, as well as the gestational age and health of the fetus.'""Women with mild preeclampsia are often induced at 37 weeks' gestation. Prior to this time, they can be managed at home or in the hospital with close monitoring. During this time steroid ""'drugs'"" may be given to promote maturation of the baby's lungs. Women with mild preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks' gestation are often placed on bed rest with frequent medical monitoring.""'In severe preeclampsia, delivery (induction of ''labor'' or Cesarean delivery [''C-section'']) is usually considered after 34 weeks of gestation. The risks to the mother and baby from the disease must be balanced against the risk of prematurity in each case. Intravenous magnesium sulfate can be given to women with severe preeclampsia to prevent seizures. This medication is safe for the baby. Oral ''supplements'' containing magnesium are not effective in preventing seizures and are not recommended. Medications such as ''hydralazine'' to lower blood pressure may also be given.''Eclampsia is a medical emergency. It is treated with medications to control seizures and maintain a stable blood pressure with the goal of minimizing complications for both mother and baby. Magnesium sulfate is used as a first-line treatment when eclamptic seizures do occur. If the seizures are not controlled by magnesium sulfate, other medications such as ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'', ''Dilantin-125'') can be administered.' "
What are complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia reduces the amount of blood flow to the placenta and the fetus. Therefore, the baby may have delayed growth and low birth weight. Preterm delivery is also more common. Oligohydramnios, a decrease in the volume of ''amniotic fluid'',\xa0is a frequent accompaniment of preeclampsia.''Severe preeclampsia can affect liver and kidney function. HELLP syndrome,\xa0''hemolysis'' (destruction of ''red blood cells''), elevated ''liver enzymes'', and low platelets, is a rare complication of preeclampsia. Symptoms include ''headache'', ''nausea'',\xa0''vomiting'', and right upper quadrant\xa0''abdominal pain''. In some cases, HELLP syndrome develops before the typical signs of preeclampsia are apparent.''Other uncommon complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia include decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in a ''stroke''.' Preeclampsia increases the risk of placental abruption, or separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. When this is severe, life-threatening bleeding and fetal death can occur."
Can preeclampsia and eclampsia be prevented?,"'There is no way known to prevent preeclampsia and eclampsia. However, the outcome can be improved with prompt recognition and management, so it is important for pregnant women to have routine health screenings.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,'Most women with mild preeclampsia have good pregnancy outcomes. Eclampsia is a serious condition with about a 2% mortality (death) rate.''The recurrence risk for preeclampsia varies according to the onset and severity of the condition.''Women with preeclampsia may be at increased risk for ''cardiovascular disease'' later in life. This risk is greatest in women with early onset of severe preeclampsia. Research is ongoing to further clarify this potential risk.' Women with severe preeclampsia who had an onset of the condition early in pregnancy have the highest recurrence risk. Studies show recurrence rates of 25% to 65% for this population. Only 5% to 7% of women with mild preeclampsia will have preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy.
Preeclampsia Facts*,"'*''Preeclampsia'' facts medically edited by: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD' High blood pressure during pregnancy can be dangerous for the mother and baby. Effects of high blood pressure during pregnancy range from mild to severe. Preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) generally begins after the 20th week of pregnancy and is related to increased blood pressure and protein in the mother's urine. Approximately 6% to 8% of women in the U.S. experience high blood pressure during pregnancy. Risk factors for preeclampsia include chronic high blood pressure before becoming pregnant; preeclampsia in previous pregnancies; pregnancy occurring under the age of 20 or over the age of 40, multiple gestation; and previous conditions such as lupus, scleroderma, diabetes, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms of preeclampsia include 
	persistent headaches, blurred vision, abdominal pain, and sensitivity to light. There is no single test to diagnose preeclampsia. If you have high blood pressure and are thinking of becoming pregnant; keep your blood pressure under control with lifestyle changes; discuss how high blood pressure may affect you and your baby with your doctor; if you take blood pressure medications; discuss how these medications may affect your baby.
	 While you are pregnant avoid alcohol and 
	tobacco, make sure you receive regular prenatal medical care, and discuss any OTC medications you are taking with your doctor. There is no proven way to prevent preeclampsia."
What Is High Blood Pressure?,"""Blood pressure is the amount of force exerted by the blood against the walls of the arteries. A person's blood pressure is considered high when the readings are greater than 140 mm Hg systolic (the top number in the blood pressure reading) or 90 mm Hg diastolic (the bottom number). In general, high blood pressure, or ""'hypertension'', contributes to the development of coronary ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', ''heart failure'' and kidney disease.' "
What Are the Effects of High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy?,"'Although many pregnant women with high blood pressure have healthy ''babies'' without serious problems, high blood pressure can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. Women with pre-existing, or chronic, high blood pressure are more likely to have certain complications during pregnancy than those with normal blood pressure. However, some women develop high blood pressure while they are pregnant (often called gestational ''hypertension'').''The effects of high blood pressure range from mild to severe. High blood pressure can harm the mother\'s kidneys and other organs, and it can cause low birth weight and early delivery. In the most serious cases, the mother develops preeclampsia - or ""toxemia of pregnancy""--which can threaten the lives of both the mother and the fetus.' "
What Is Preeclampsia?,"""Preeclampsia is a condition that typically starts after the 20th week of pregnancy and is related to increased blood pressure and protein in the mother's urine (as a result of kidney problems). Preeclampsia affects the placenta, and it can affect the mother's kidney, ""'liver'', and brain. When preeclampsia causes ''seizures'', the condition is known as ''eclampsia''--the second leading cause of maternal death in the U.S. Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low birth weight, premature birth, and ''stillbirth''.''There is no proven way to prevent preeclampsia. Most women who develop signs of preeclampsia, however, are closely monitored to lessen or avoid related problems. The only way to ""cure"" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.'  "
How Common Are High Blood Pressure and Preeclampsia in Pregnancy?,"'High blood pressure problems occur in 6 percent to 8 percent of all pregnancies in the U.S., about 70 percent of which are first-time pregnancies. In 1998, more than 146,320 cases of preeclampsia alone were diagnosed.''Although the proportion of pregnancies with gestational ''hypertension'' and ''eclampsia'' has remained about the same in the U.S. over the past decade, the rate of preeclampsia has increased by nearly one-third. This increase is due in part to a rise in the numbers of older mothers and of multiple births, where preeclampsia occurs more frequently. For example, in 1998 birth rates among women ages 30 to 44 and the number of births to women ages 45 and older were at the highest levels in 3 decades, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Furthermore, between 1980 and 1998, rates of twin births increased about 50 percent overall and 1,000 percent among women ages 45 to 49; rates of triplet and other higher-order multiple births jumped more than 400 percent overall, and 1,000 percent among women in their 40s.' "
Who Is More Likely to Develop Preeclampsia?," Women with chronic hypertension (high blood pressure before becoming pregnant). 
 Women who developed high blood pressure or preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy, especially if these conditions occurred early in the pregnancy. 
 Women who are obese prior to pregnancy. 
 Pregnant women under the age of 20 or over the age of 40. 
 Women who are pregnant with more than one baby. 
 Women with diabetes, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma.

What Are the Symptoms of Preeclampsia and How Is It Detected?,"'Unfortunately, there is no single test to predict or diagnose preeclampsia. Key signs are increased blood pressure and ''protein in the urine'' (''proteinuria''). Other symptoms that seem to occur with preeclampsia include persistent ''headaches'', blurred vision or sensitivity to light, and ''abdominal pain''.''All of these sensations can be caused by other disorders; they can also occur in healthy pregnancies. Regular visits with your doctor help him or her to track your blood pressure and level of protein in your urine, to order and analyze blood tests that detect signs of preeclampsia, and to monitor ''fetal development'' more closely.' "
How Can Women with High Blood Pressure Prevent Problems During Pregnancy?,"'If you are thinking about having a baby and you have high blood pressure, talk first to your doctor or nurse. Taking steps to control your blood pressure before and during pregnancy-and getting regular ''prenatal care'""-go a long way toward ensuring your well-being and your baby's health. ""'Before becoming pregnant: ''While you are pregnant: '  Be sure your blood pressure is under control. Lifestyle changes such as limiting your salt intake, participating in regular physical activity, and losing weight if you are overweight can be helpful.  
 Discuss with your doctor how hypertension might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, and what you can do to prevent or lessen problems.  
 If you take medicines for your blood pressure, ask your doctor whether you should change the amount you take or stop taking them during pregnancy. Experts currently recommend avoiding 
	angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
	Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists during pregnancy; other blood pressure medications may be OK for you to use. Do not, however, stop or change your medicines unless your doctor tells you to do so. 
 	 Obtain regular prenatal medical care.  Avoid alcohol and tobacco.   Talk to your doctor about any over-the-counter medications you are taking or are thinking about taking.

Does Hypertension or Preeclampsia During Pregnancy Cause Long-Term Heart and Blood Vessel Problems?,"""The effects of high blood pressure during pregnancy vary depending on the disorder and other factors. According to the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP), preeclampsia does not in general increase a woman's risk for developing chronic hypertension or other ""'heart''-related problems. The NHBPEP also reports that in women with normal blood pressure who develop preeclampsia after the 20th week of their first pregnancy, short-term complications-including increased blood pressure-usually go away within about 6 weeks after delivery. ''Some women, however, may be more likely to develop high blood pressure or other ''heart disease'' later in life. More research is needed to determine the long-term health effects of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and to develop better methods for identifying, diagnosing, and treating women at risk for these conditions. ''Even though high blood pressure and related disorders during pregnancy can be serious, most women with high blood pressure and those who develop preeclampsia have successful pregnancies. Obtaining early and regular prenatal care is the most important thing you can do for you and your baby.' "
What is pregnancy planning?,"'Pregnancy planning begins even before conception for many women. Others choose to start planning when they are aware of a pregnancy. While it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby without a pregnancy plan, developing a pregnancy plan is one way to help ensure that your baby has the greatest chances of having good health and that you have a healthy pregnancy. Planning for pregnancy typically involves:' Discussions with a woman's partner and her health-care team, and includes discussions about nutrition and vitamins, exercise, genetic counseling, weight gain, and the need to avoid certain medications and alcohol. Sometimes, planning for pregnancy includes fertility planning and scheduling sexual intercourse for the time of the month when the woman is most fertile. Couples who are having regular sexual intercourse and who still do not conceive typically consult a fertility specialist. Doctors generally recommend that healthy couples in which the woman is under 35 try to get pregnant for a year before consulting a fertility specialist. Women over 35 may want to consult a fertility specialist after 6 months of trying to conceive. Because some women experience light bleeding known as implantation bleeding around the time of the expected menstrual period, or because of irregular menstrual cycles, some women may not realize they are pregnant until specific symptoms of pregnancy start to develop. By this time, the woman may have unknowingly exposed herself to substances that may be harmful for the pregnancy. Women who choose to begin pregnancy planning before conception can take steps to ensure that potentially harmful exposures are avoided."
Why is pregnancy planning important?,"'Before a woman becomes pregnant she can discuss her medical history with a doctor, focusing on the following:'   Chronic medical conditions like diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, or heart disease should be monitored and well controlled prior to conception for the greatest chances of a healthy pregnancy. Women may be tested to determine if they have been infected with the HIV or hepatitis B viruses, so that appropriate treatment during pregnancy or at delivery can help prevent transmission of the infections to the baby. Immunization history and immune response to varicella (chickenpox) and rubella (German measles): the status of a woman's immunity to these two infections, which can cause harm to the developing fetus can be determined by a blood test. If a woman is not immune to these infections, vaccinations can be given before trying to conceive. After receiving the varicella vaccine, women should wait 30 days before attempting conception. Precautions against developing certain other infections should also be taken. Couples who have a history of inherited diseases, have other children with genetic diseases, or who have family histories of certain conditions may choose to undergo genetic counseling prior to conception. Your doctor can help you determine whether genetic counseling is appropriate for you. Smoking cessation dramatically improves the chances of a healthy pregnancy, and women planning pregnancy should abstain from alcohol use. Those with substance abuse problems should ideally be identified and treated prior to planning a pregnancy."
What is a pregnancy calendar or calculator?,"'A ''pregnancy calendar'"" or calculator is a tool that helps a woman determine precisely which changes are taking place in her body and in the fetus at a given week of pregnancy. Calculators are also available to predict a woman's due date. Many versions of pregnancy calendars and calculators can be found online."" "
When can a woman start trying to get pregnant after stopping birth control?,"'A woman is physiologically able to become pregnant as soon as she is no longer using ''birth control''. For certain hormonal methods designed for longer-term ''contraception'', the effects can take some time to wear off so pregnancy is possible when the hormonal effects wear off. There is no evidence to suggest that waiting a few cycles after stopping ''oral contraceptives'' ""''the pill''"" will lead to better pregnancy outcomes.'  "
Is there a special diet for a woman who is planning for a pregnancy?,"'A healthy ''diet'' that provides all the necessary nutrients for the developing fetus increases the chances of a healthy pregnancy. For this reason, it is best to avoid certain diets in pregnancy. In particular, high-fat diets, some ''vegetarian'' diets, and ''weight loss'' diets should generally be avoided by pregnant women. A healthy ''diet'' also means limiting ''sugar'' intake. Many women also choose to start eating a healthy diet in the stage prior to conception to maximize their chances of delivering a healthy baby. In general, a healthy diet is the same for both pregnant women and non-pregnant women, with a few special exceptions that will be discussed below.''Evidence about whether consumption of ''caffeine'' in pregnancy is detrimental has been inconclusive. However, it is known that the fetus metabolizes ''caffeine'' very slowly, so maternal consumption of caffeine results in a prolonged exposure for the fetus. Consumption of typical levels of caffeine has not been associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet individual studies have shown that caffeine can lead to changes in fetal arousal and ''heart'' rate. According to many experts, including the American Academy of ''Nutrition'' and Dietetics, caffeine intake in pregnant women should be limited to 200 mg per day (equivalent to one 12 oz. cup).''Women who are planning to become pregnant are advised to take folic acid ''supplements'' to reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects in the fetus. The neural tube closes early in pregnancy (18 to 26 days after conception) so supplementation with folic acid is most critical during the early days of pregnancy. Often, supplementation after the diagnosis of pregnancy is too late to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. ''Vitamins'' containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid, taken daily, are recommended.''Due to the presence of certain environmental toxins (such as mercury), the kinds and amount of fish (and shellfish) that are eaten during pregnancy should be regulated. The US FDA has issued guidance for pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy regarding the types and amount of fish that should be eaten.''Megavitamins may not be safe for pregnant women, since excessive doses of vitamins can be harmful and their effects on the fetus have not been fully studied. Megadoses of ''vitamin A'' in early pregnancy have been linked to ''birth defects''. Women planning pregnancy and who are pregnant also are advised not to consume nonessential ''dietary supplements'' or herbal preparations, since their effects on the developing fetus are unknown. The safest choice for women planning a pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin supplement that contains folic acid and iron.''Pregnant women also should try to avoid unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, deli and luncheon meats, and undercooked or raw animal foods. This is due to the risk of exposure to ''Listeria'' monocytogenes'', common bacteria that can cause miscarriages and other problems. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well before consumption.' In general, 2-3 servings of fish that are low in mercury are recommended per week. Seafood that is lower in mercury includes salmon, shrimp, Pollock, tuna (light canned), tilapia, catfish, and cod. Tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel are typically high in mercury and should be avoided. Pregnant women should not consume raw fish."
How much weight should you gain during pregnancy?,"""The mother's pre-pregnancy weight should be taken into account when estimating how much weight gain is appropriate for a healthy pregnancy. Women with multiple gestation pregnancies will need to gain more weight to maintain a healthy pregnancy than those with singleton pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued guidelines for recommended weight gain in women who have a singleton pregnancy. They are as follows:"" Underweight women (BMI < 18.5) should gain 28-40 pounds. Normal-weight women (BMI, 18.5-24.9) should gain 25-35 pounds. Overweight women (BMI, 25-29.9) should gain 15-25 pounds Obese women (BMI, 30 or higher) should gain 11-20 pounds."
Can you drink alcohol if you are pregnant?,"'Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. These include ''fetal alcohol syndrome'' (''FAS''), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (ARND). ''Fetal alcohol syndrome'' is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities in children. The exact amount of alcohol exposure that is associated with these disorders has not been determined, so there is no known limit for safe alcohol consumption in pregnancy. For this reason, women planning to conceive and pregnant women are advised not to drink alcohol.' "
Should I exercise when pregnant?,"'Exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle and is recommended for healthy pregnant women who have uncomplicated pregnancies, with a few exceptions. You should always discuss your exercise program with your doctor. Recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology state that pregnant women who have an uncomplicated pregnancy should participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. However, there are some sports with an increased risk of ''trauma'' to the abdomen that should be avoided. These include ice hockey, kickboxing, soccer, and horseback riding. Scuba diving should also be avoided in pregnancy since it poses a risk of decompression sickness (""the bends"") to the fetus.' "
Is it safe to have sexual intercourse during pregnancy?,"'For most women, sex during pregnancy is safe. Your doctor may recommend avoiding sexual intercourse if you have certain conditions or risk factors. These include prior preterm ''labor'', multiple miscarriages, infection, bleeding, ''amniotic fluid'' leak, and ''placenta previa'' (low placenta). Pregnant women should not have sexual activity that would put them at risk for contracting a sexually-transmitted disease (''STD'').' "
Is it safe to diet during pregnancy?,"'Pregnant women should always follow a healthy nutrition plan that is optimized for both mother and baby (see previous sections on dietary considerations and weight gain). A weight reduction diet is not appropriate for pregnant women. Even women who are overweight or obese prior to the pregnancy will need to gain weight during pregnancy, although some may need to gain slightly less weight than normal-weight women. Women who are overweight or obese should discuss with their doctor the best amount of weight gain weight gain for the pregnancy.' "
Is it safe to fly if you are pregnant?,"'According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, occasional air travel in pregnancy is considered safe, and there are no data to show that air travel adversely affects pregnancy outcomes for occasional ''travelers''. Most airlines allow women to fly up to the 36th week of gestation. Women who have high-risk pregnancies and are at risk for preterm ''labor'' or who may require emergency care should avoid air travel. It is generally recommended that pregnant women traveling by air take precaution to decrease their risk of developing ''blood clots'' (thrombi) in the extremities. The use of support stockings, frequent ambulation, and remaining well hydrated can help reduce the risks of developing a ''blood clot'' in the legs during long flights.' "
Can you continue to take medications when you are planning to get pregnant? What about if you are pregnant?,"""Part of pregnancy planning involves attention to underlying or pre-existing medical conditions that may affect a woman's pregnancy. Women who take regular medications should review their medication schedule (including any over-the-counter medications or supplements) with their doctor when planning to conceive. Some medications may be harmful to the fetus, while other ""'drugs'' are safe for pregnant women. It may be necessary to discontinue certain medications or change to alternate medications in some cases. For example, the ''acne'' medication ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane) has been shown to cause birth defects in the fetus.'""In some cases the effects of a particular medication may be unclear in pregnant women. In these cases a decision must be made regarding the necessity of the medication for the mother's health versus possible or unknown risks to the fetus.""'Women taking oral contraceptives who become pregnant are not believed to be at any increased risk for poor outcomes, although the oral contraceptives should be discontinued immediately.''It is safe for women who become ill during pregnancy to be treated with many medications; however, some medications, including some antibiotics and ''pain'' relief medicines, may not be recommended for pregnant women. It is important if you require medication to tell your doctor that you may be pregnant or are trying to conceive.' "
Foods foods should you avoid if you are pregnant? What is rubella? Is there a vaccine?,"'Avoiding certain foods can help prevent infection with ''Listeria'' bacteria, which can cause problems with pregnancy.''Viral infections that can cause problems for the mother and/or the fetus include:''Infection with the parasite ''Toxoplasma''\xa0is a risk for pregnant women.''Rubella viral infection in early pregnancy can cause ''miscarriage'' or birth defects. Therefore, women of childbearing age are tested for immunity to this virus, and those lacking antibodies to the rubella virus should be vaccinated against this virus.' Rubella (German measles) Varicella (chicken pox) HIV Hepatitis B Genital herpes (herpes simplex virus (HSV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Parvovirus B19"
What are genital herpes and the Parvovirus B19?,"'If a pregnant woman has ''genital herpes'' infection, it is possible to transmit the virus to the baby at the time of delivery. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can have multiple effects in the newborn. The infection may be limited to the eyes, skin and mouth. It may be localized to the central nervous system or may be widespread. Antiviral medications are given to the newborn after delivery. Cesarean delivery (''C-section'') is recommended for most women with an active outbreak of genital HSV infection at the time of ''labor'' to prevent transmission of the infection to the baby.''Parvovirus B19 causes ''fifth disease'', a common mild disease of childhood that is spread by respiratory secretions or blood. Pregnant women who have not previously had ''fifth disease'' should avoid contact with people with the condition since parvovirus B-19 can infect the fetus. About 65% of pregnant women in North America have evidence of previous infection with parvovirus B-19, while acute parvovirus B-19 infection occurs in up to 2% of pregnant women in endemic periods. About 30% of women who develop parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy will transmit the infection across the placenta to the fetus. Although no birth defects have been reported as a result of fifth disease, the infection can cause fetal death. For women who contract parvovirus in the ''first trimester'', the rate of fetal loss can be as high as 10%. Avoiding persons with fifth disease can greatly reduce the chances of becoming infected.' "
"What are hepatitis B and C, HIV, and Chickenpox?","'Hepatitis'' viruses B and C can affect newborns, but ''hepatitis'' B is much more commonly passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. Only about 4% of fetuses exposed to maternal ''hepatitis C'' become infected while that percentage is much higher for those with Hepatitis B (90%).''Infants born to mothers infected with the hepatitis B virus are given both hepatitis B antibodies and hepatitis B vaccinations at birth for protection. Currently there is no effective way to prevent transmission of ''hepatitis C'' in newborns, and the medications used to treat ''hepatitis C'' in adults are not recommended for pregnant woman or infants.''HIV infection can be passed from a mother to the baby. The chances of this happening can be greatly reduced by treating the mother with certain medication regimens during pregnancy.''Varicella, or ''chickenpox'', infection can cause ''pneumonia'' or even death in older adults and in pregnant women. Varicella vaccine is available for women who are not immune to chickenpox. After receiving the varicella vaccine, women should wait 30 days before attempting conception.' "
What is toxoplasma and the Zika virus?,"'Toxoplasma is a parasite that is transmitted through cat feces and raw meats, especially pork. As with infection with the rubella virus, ''toxoplasmosis'' can cause birth defects if the infection occurs during early pregnancy. Women planning pregnancy can decrease the risk of contracting toxoplasmosis by avoiding raw meat and avoid handling cat litter boxes. It is possible to have been exposed to toxoplasmosis and have immunity to the infection without being aware of it Women can have a blood test to determine if they have immunity to toxoplasmosis; if the test is positive for toxoplasmosis immunity, the woman will not develop toxoplasmosis complications during pregnancy. There is no vaccine available to prevent toxoplasmosis.''Zika virus'' is a Flavivirus that is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. The illness that follows may last for a few days to a week and causes signs and symptoms like ''conjunctivitis'' (''redness of the eyes''), ''rash'', ''fever'', and ''joint pain''. The virus has been traditionally reported in Indonesia and Africa, but it has continued to spread through North and South America including the U.S. The viral infection has been associated with to birth defects (mainly small brain size and ''small head'', known as ''microcephaly'', as well as certain eye defects that can cause ''vision loss'') in ''babies'' whose mothers contracted ''Zika virus'' infections during pregnancy. While mosquito-borne transmission is the usual route of spread, the virus may less commonly be spread through sexual intercourse, through blood transfusions, or from mother to fetus.''The US Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) maintains a web site with up-to-date information on the risks of contracting ''Zika'' virus in specific areas of the world. Pregnant women should avoid travel to an area where ''Zika'' virus transmission is occurring. An updated list of areas that should be avoided by pregnant women can be found at the CDC web site (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices). Also, pregnant women with a male partner who lives in or has traveled to an area with an active ''Zika'' infection should use ''condoms'' during sex or abstain from sex until the pregnancy is over.'

How many weeks is a normal term pregnancy?,"'Pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, counting from the first day of your last normal period. The weeks are grouped into three trimesters (tri-MESSTURS).' "
What is the first trimester of pregnancy (week 1-week 12)?,"'During the ''first trimester'' your body undergoes many changes. Hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. These changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. Your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. Other changes may include:''As your body changes, you might need to make changes to your daily routine, such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent, small meals. Fortunately, most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. And some women might not feel any discomfort at all! If you have been pregnant before, you might feel differently this time around. Just as each woman is different, so is each pregnancy.'   Extreme tiredness Tender, swollen breasts. Your nipples might also stick out. Upset stomach with or without throwing up (morning sickness) Cravings or distaste for certain foods Mood swings Constipation (trouble having bowel movements) Need to pass urine more often Headache Heartburn Weight gain or loss"
What is the second trimester of pregnancy (week 13-week 28)?,"'Most women find the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy easier than the first. But it is just as important to stay informed about your pregnancy during these months.''You might notice that symptoms like ''nausea'' and ''fatigue'' are going away. But other new, more noticeable changes to your body are now happening. Your abdomen will expand as the baby continues to grow. And before this trimester is over, you will feel your baby beginning to move!''As your body changes to make room for your growing baby, you may have:' Body aches, such as back, abdomen, groin, or thigh pain Stretch marks on your abdomen, breasts, thighs, or buttocks Darkening of the skin around your nipples A line on the skin running from belly button to pubic hairline Patches of darker skin, usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. Patches often match on both sides of the face. This is sometimes called the mask of pregnancy Numb or tingling hands, called carpal tunnel syndrome Itching on the abdomen, palms, and soles of the feet. (Call your doctor if you have nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice or fatigue combined with itching. These can be signs of a serious liver problem.) Swelling of the ankles, fingers, and face. (If you notice any sudden or extreme swelling or if you gain a lot of weight really quickly, call your doctor right away. This could be a sign of preeclampsia.)"
What is the third trimester trimester of pregnancy (week 29-week 40)?,"""You're in the home stretch! Some of the same discomforts you had in your second trimester will continue. Plus, many women find ""'breathing'"" difficult and notice they have to go to the bathroom even more often. This is because the baby is getting bigger and it is putting more pressure on your organs. Don't worry, your baby is fine and these problems will lessen once you give birth.""'Some new body changes you might notice in the ''third trimester'' include:''As you near your due date, your cervix becomes thinner and softer (called effacing). This is a normal, natural process that helps the birth canal to open during the birthing process. Your doctor will check your progress with a vaginal exam as you near your due date.

How will my baby develop week by week?,"'At 4 weeks:''At 8 weeks:''At 12 weeks:''At 16 weeks:''At 20 weeks:''At 24 weeks:''At 32 weeks:''At 36 weeks:''Weeks 37-40:' Your baby's brain and spinal cord have begun to form. The heart begins to form. Arm and leg buds appear. Your baby is now an embryo and one-fifth of an inch long. All major organs and external body structures have begun to form. Your baby's heart beats with a regular rhythm. The arms and legs grow longer, and fingers and toes have begun to form. The sex organs begin to form. The eyes have moved forward on the face and eyelids have formed. The umbilical cord is clearly visible. At the end of 8 weeks, your baby is a fetus and looks more like a human. Your baby is nearly 1 inch long and weighs less than 1/8 of an ounce. The nerves and muscles begin to work together. Your baby can make a fist. Eyelids close to protect the developing eyes. They will not open again until the 28th week. Head growth has slowed, and your baby is much longer. Now, at about 3 inches long, your baby weighs almost an ounce. The external sex organs show if your baby is a boy or girl. A woman who has an ultrasound in the second trimester or later might be able to find out the baby's sex. Muscle tissue and bone continue to form, creating a more complete skeleton. Skin begins to form. You can nearly see through it. Meconium (mih-KOH-nee-uhm) develops in your baby's intestinal tract. This will be your baby's first bowel movement. Your baby makes sucking motions with the mouth (sucking reflex). Your baby reaches a length of about 4 to 5 inches and weighs almost 3 ounces. Your baby is more active. You might feel slight fluttering. Your baby is covered by fine, downy hair called lanugo (luh-NOO-goh) and a waxy coating called vernix. This protects the forming skin underneath. Eyebrows, eyelashes, fingernails, and toenails have formed. Your baby can even scratch itself. Your baby can hear and swallow. Now halfway through your pregnancy, your baby is about 6 inches long and weighs about 9 ounces. Bone marrow begins to make blood cells. Taste buds form on your baby's tongue. Footprints and fingerprints have formed. Real hair begins to grow on your baby's head. The lungs are formed, but do not work. The hand and startle reflex develop. Your baby sleeps and wakes regularly. If your baby is a boy, his testicles begin to move from the abdomen into the scrotum. If your baby is a girl, her uterus and ovaries are in place, and a lifetime supply of eggs have formed in the ovaries. Your baby stores fat and has gained quite a bit of weight.

Now, your baby is about 15 to 17 inches long and weighs about 3 to 33⁄4 pounds The protective waxy coating called vernix gets thicker. Body fat increases. Your baby is getting bigger and bigger and has less space to move around. Movements are less forceful, but you will feel stretches and wiggles. Your baby is about 16 to 19 inches long and weighs about 6 to 6½ pounds. By the end of 37 weeks, your baby is considered full term. Your baby's organs are ready to function on their own. As you near your due date, your baby may turn into a head-down position for birth. Most babies ""present"" head down. At birth, your baby may weigh somewhere between 6 pounds 2 ounces and 9 pounds 2 ounces and be 19 to 21 inches long. Most full-term babies fall within these ranges.

Body aches,"""As your uterus expands, you may feel aches and pains in the back, abdomen, groin area, and thighs. Many women also have backaches and aching near the pelvic bone due the pressure of the baby's head, increased weight, and loosening joints. Some pregnant women complain of ""'pain'' that runs from the lower back, down the back of one leg, to the knee or foot. This is called ''sciatica'' (Sci-AT-ick-uh). It is thought to occur when the uterus puts pressure on the ''sciatic nerve''.''What might help:''Call the doctor if the pain does not get better.' Lie down. Rest. Apply heat."
Breast changes,"'During pregnancy, you might have:'""A woman's breasts increase in size and fullness during pregnancy. As the due date approaches, hormone changes will cause your breasts to get even bigger to prepare for ""'breastfeeding''. Your breasts may feel full, heavy, or tender.''In the third trimester, some pregnant women begin to leak colostrum (coh-LOSS-truhm) from their breasts. Colostrum is the first milk that your breasts produce for the baby. It is a thick, yellowish fluid containing antibodies that protect newborns from infection.''You feel a lump or have ''nipple'' changes or discharge (that is not colostrum) or skin changes.' Wear a maternity bra with good support. Put pads in the bra to absorb leakage."
Constipation,"'Many pregnant women complain of ''constipation''. Signs of ''constipation'' include having hard, dry stools; fewer than three bowel movements per week; and painful bowel movements.''Higher levels of hormones due to pregnancy slow down ''digestion'' and relax muscles in the bowels leaving many women constipated. Plus, the pressure of the expanding uterus on the bowels can contribute to constipation.''If constipation does not go away.' Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. Don't drink caffeine. Eat fiber-rich foods, such as fresh or dried fruit, raw vegetables, and whole-grain cereals and breads. Try mild physical activity"
Dizziness,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''Many pregnant women complain of ''dizziness'' and ''lightheadedness'' throughout their pregnancies. ''Fainting'"" is rare but does happen even in some healthy pregnant women. There are many reasons for these symptoms. The growth of more blood vessels in early pregnancy, the pressure of the expanding uterus on blood vessels, and the body's increased need for food all can make a pregnant woman feel lightheaded and dizzy.""'You feel faint and have ''vaginal bleeding'' or ''abdominal pain''.' Stand up slowly. Avoid standing for too long. Don't skip meals. Lie on your left side. Wear loose clothing."
"Fatigue, sleep problems","""During your pregnancy, you might feel tired even after you've had a lot of ""'sleep'"". Many women find they're exhausted in the first trimester. Don't worry, this is normal! This is your body's way of telling you that you need more rest. In the second trimester, tiredness is usually replaced with a feeling of well being and energy. But in the third trimester, exhaustion often sets in again. As you get larger, sleeping may become more difficult. The baby's movements, bathroom runs, and an increase in the body's metabolism might interrupt or disturb your ""'sleep'"". Leg cramping can also interfere with a good night's sleep."" Lie on your left side. Use pillows for support, such as behind your back, tucked between your knees, and under your tummy. Practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and using your bed only for sleep and sex. Go to bed a little earlier. Nap if you are not able to get enough sleep at night. Drink needed fluids earlier in the day, so you can drink less in the hours before bed."
Heartburn and indigestion,"'Hormones and the pressure of the growing uterus cause ''indigestion'' and heartburn. Pregnancy hormones slow down the muscles of the digestive tract. So food tends to move more slowly and digestion is sluggish. This causes many pregnant women to feel ''bloated''.''Hormones also relax the valve that separates the ''esophagus'' from the stomach. This allows food and acids to come back up from the stomach to the esophagus. The food and acid causes the burning feeling of heartburn. As your baby gets bigger, the uterus pushes on the stomach making heartburn more common in later pregnancy.''Call the doctor if:'""Symptoms don't improve after trying these suggestions. Ask your doctor about using an antacid.""  Eat several small meals instead of three large meals -- eat slowly. Drink fluids between meals -- not with meals. Don't eat greasy and fried foods. Avoid citrus fruits or juices and spicy foods. Do not eat or drink within a few hours of bedtime. Do not lie down right after meals."
Hemorrhoids during pregnancy,"'Hemorrhoids'' (HEM-roidz) are swollen and bulging veins in the rectum. They can cause itching, pain, and bleeding. Up to 50 percent of pregnant women get ''hemorrhoids''. Hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy for many reasons. During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly, which can cause veins to enlarge. The expanding uterus also puts pressure on the veins in the rectum. Plus, constipation can worsen hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids usually improve after delivery.' Drink lots of fluids. Eat fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, raw or cooked leafy green vegetables, and fruits. Try not to strain with bowel movements. Talk to your doctor about using products such as witch hazel to soothe hemorrhoids."
Itching,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''About 20 percent of pregnant women feel ''itchy'' during pregnancy. Usually women feel ''itchy'' in the abdomen. But red, itchy palms and soles of the feet are also common complaints. Pregnancy hormones and stretching skin are probably to blame for most of your discomfort. Usually the itchy feeling goes away after delivery.''Call the doctor if:'""Symptoms don't improve after a week of self-care."" Use gentle soaps and moisturizing creams. Avoid hot showers and baths. Avoid itchy fabrics."
Leg cramps,"'At different times during your pregnancy, you might have sudden ''muscle spasms'' in your legs or feet. They usually occur at night. This is due to a change in the way your body processes calcium.' Gently stretch muscles. Get mild exercise. For sudden cramps, flex your foot forward. Eat calcium-rich foods. Ask your doctor about magnesium supplements."
Morning sickness,"'In the first trimester hormone changes can cause nausea and ''vomiting''. This is called ""morning sickness,"" although it can occur at any time of day. Morning sickness usually tapers off by the second trimester.''You have ''flu-like symptoms'', which may signal a more serious condition.''You have severe, constant nausea and/or vomiting several times every day.'   Eat several small meals instead of three large meals to keep your stomach from being empty. Don't lie down after meals. Eat dry toast, saltines, or dry cereals before getting out of bed in the morning. Eat bland foods that are low in fat and easy to digest, such as cereal, rice, and bananas. Sip on water, weak tea, or clear soft drinks. Or eat ice chips. Avoid smells that upset your stomach."
Nasal problems,"'Nosebleeds'' and nasal stuffiness are common during pregnancy. They are caused by the increased amount of blood in your body and hormones acting on the tissues of your nose.''Nosebleeds'' are frequent and do not stop after a few minutes.' Blow your nose gently. Drink fluids and use a cool mist humidifier. To stop a nosebleed, squeeze your nose between your thumb and forefinger for a few minutes."
Numb or tingling hands,"'Feelings of swelling, tingling, and numbness in fingers and hands, called ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', can occur during pregnancy. These symptoms are due to ''swelling of tissues'' in the narrow passages in your wrists, and they should disappear after delivery.' Take frequent breaks to rest hands. Ask your doctor about fitting you for a splint to keep wrists straight."
"Stretch marks, skin changes","'Stretch marks are red, pink, or brown streaks on the skin. Most often they appear on the thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and breasts. These ''scars'' are caused by the stretching of the skin, and usually appear in the second half of pregnancy.''Some women notice other skin changes during pregnancy. For many women, the nipples become darker and browner during pregnancy. Many pregnant women also develop a dark line (called the linea nigra) on the skin that runs from the belly button down to the pubic hairline. Patches of darker skin usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip also are common. Patches often match on both sides of the face. These spots are called ''melasma'' or chloasma and are more common in darker-skinned women.'  Be patient - stretch marks and other changes usually fade after delivery."
Swelling,"'During pregnancy, you might have:''Many women develop mild swelling in the face, hands, or ankles at some point in their pregnancies. As the due date approaches, swelling often becomes more noticeable.''Your hands or feet swell suddenly or you rapidly gain weight - it may be preeclampsia.' Drink eight to 10 glasses of fluids daily. Don't drink caffeine or eat salty foods. Rest and elevate your feet. Ask your doctor about support hose."
Urinary frequency and leaking,"'Temporary bladder control problems are common in pregnancy. Your unborn baby pushes down on the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor muscles. This pressure can lead to more frequent need to urinate, as well as leaking of urine when ''sneezing'', ''coughing'', or laughing.' Take frequent bathroom breaks. Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Do Kegel exercises to tone pelvic muscles."
Varicose veins,"'During pregnancy blood volume increases greatly. This can cause veins to enlarge. Plus, pressure on the large veins behind the uterus causes the blood to slow in its return to the heart. For these reasons, ''varicose veins'' in the legs and anus (hemorrhoids) are more common in pregnancy.''Varicose veins'' look like swollen veins raised above the surface of the skin. They can be twisted or bulging and are dark purple or blue in color. They are found most often on the backs of the calves or on the inside of the leg.' Sit with your legs and feet raised."
How soon do early pregnancy symptoms start?,"'Some women may experience early signs and symptoms within the first weeks of pregnancy in the ''first trimester'', while others may develop symptoms later on in the pregnancy. The first signs and symptoms of early pregnancy can also be similar to symptoms experienced prior to the ''menstrual period'', so a woman may not recognize the symptoms as related to pregnancy.' "
Are pregnancy symptoms the same for every woman?,"'Symptoms of pregnancy'' can vary among different women. They may vary in quality or severity, and even the same woman may not experience the same symptoms in every pregnancy. The first signs and symptoms of pregnancy may also be noticed or begin at different points in the pregnancy. A ''pregnancy test'' is based on levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine or blood, and is the characteristic diagnostic test for pregnancy. hCG is a hormone produced after the fertilized egg has implanted in the wall of the uterus. Modern home ''pregnancy tests'' may sometimes be positive before a ''missed menstrual period''. Blood tests can detect pregnancy earlier than urine pregnancy tests.''This article describes the most common symptoms of pregnancy in its early and later stages.'

16 Early pregnancy signs and symptoms,"'A number of symptoms begin in the early ''stages of pregnancy'':' Missed (late) period: A missed menstrual period is the hallmark symptom of pregnancy, and menstruation is absent throughout the pregnancy. Sometimes, the mild cramping and spotting experienced at the time of implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (see later) can be mistaken for a menstrual period. Women whose menstrual cycles are irregular may also not immediately notice the absence of a menstrual period. It is uncommon for signs and symptoms of pregnancy to appear before the missed period, but if a woman’s cycles are irregular, this may happen. Implantation bleeding or cramping: Mild bleeding or spotting may occur when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, anywhere from 6 to 12 days after fertilization. Mild cramping can also occur at this time. Implantation bleeding may sometimes be mistaken for a menstrual period, although it is usually much lighter than a regular period. Vaginal discharge: Some women may notice a thick, milky discharge from the vagina in early pregnancy. This occurs in the first weeks of pregnancy as the vaginal walls thicken. This discharge may occur throughout the pregnancy. If there is an unpleasant odor associated with the discharge, or if it is associated with burning and itching, this is a sign of a yeast or bacterial infection. You should contact your health-care professional if this occurs. Breast changes: Many women experience changes in the breasts as early as the first weeks of pregnancy. These changes can be felt as soreness, tenderness, heaviness, fullness, or a tingling sensation. The discomfort typically decreases after several weeks. Darkening of the areola: The areola, or area around the nipple, may darken in color. Fatigue: While this symptom is very nonspecific and may be related to numerous factors, pregnant women often describe feelings of fatigue from the earliest weeks of pregnancy. Morning sickness, nausea, and vomiting: This is actually a misnomer because the nausea of pregnancy can occur at any time of day. Some women never experience morning sickness, while others have severe nausea. Its most typical onset is between the 2nd and 8th weeks of pregnancy. Most women experience relief from the symptoms around the 13th or 14th week, but others may have nausea persistent throughout the pregnancy (hyperemesis gravidarum). Sensitivity to certain smells: Certain smells may bring on nausea or even vomiting early in pregnancy. Increased urination: Starting about the 6th to 8th week, some women will have more frequent urination due to hormonal changes. If other symptoms occur, such as burning on urination, you should see your health care professional make sure you are not suffering from a urinary tract infection. Dizziness or fainting: Perhaps related to hormonal changes affecting glucose levels or blood pressure, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling faint can occur in early pregnancy. Constipation: Hormone levels can also cause some women to have constipation in early pregnancy. Headaches: Headaches, as well, maybe related to changing hormone levels and may occur throughout pregnancy. Food aversions or cravings: Cravings may begin in early pregnancy and may last throughout the pregnancy. Likewise, food aversions (feeling nausea or distaste for a particular food) can also occur. Back pain: Often considered more a symptom of late pregnancy, low back pain can actually begin in the early stages of pregnancy. Women can experience some degree of back pain throughout pregnancy. Mood changes: Mood swings are relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy due to changing hormone levels. They may also be related to stress or other factors. Shortness of breath: Increased oxygen demand by the body (to support a growing fetus) may leave some women feeling short of breath, although this symptom is more common in later stages of pregnancy."
8 Later symptoms and signs of pregnancy,"'Many of the early symptoms of pregnancy can persist during the second and third ''trimesters'', for example:''Certain symptoms, like tender breasts and nausea, often improve as pregnancy advances.''Additional symptoms of later pregnancy are related to the size of the growing uterus and weight gain in the ''second trimester'' until giving birth. As with symptoms of early pregnancy, not all women experience all these symptoms, and women do not experience them to the same degree.'

   Mood changes Headaches Increased urination Backache Food cravings Fatigue Weight gain: Most women gain a total of about 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. Weight gain is due to the growing fetus, placenta, breast enlargement, and increased blood and fluid volume. Your Obstetrician will follow your weight closely during your prenatal visits. Breast changes: The breasts expand throughout pregnancy; late in pregnancy, there may be an expression of colostrum (a yellowish fluid that is produced immediately after delivery) from the nipples. Heartburn: Pressure from the growing uterus may push the stomach upward and out of its normal location, leading to symptoms of heartburn. In addition, hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause relaxation of one of the sphincters controlling the reflux of acid from the stomach. Swollen feet and ankles: Pressure from the enlarged uterus may slow down the blood flow of veins in the legs, leading to fluid buildup. Varicose veins: Increased blood volume may lead to the formation of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, or small spider veins. Leakage of urine: Pressure from the uterus on the bladder leads to frequent urination (which may have begun early in pregnancy due to hormonal changes). Sometimes, women notice leakage of urine when straining during laughing, sneezing, or coughing. Shortness of breath: The uterus enlarges and pushes the diaphragm further up toward the chest, possibly causing you to become out of breath easier than before. Braxton-Hicks contractions: In the weeks before delivery, many women experience uterine contractions. Unlike true labor contractions, Braxton-Hicks contractions are weak and do not occur at regular intervals. Labor contractions increase in frequency and intensity."
What options help soothe and relieve pregnancy symptoms?,"'There are a number of home remedies and self-care strategies that can help relieve some of the unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy.

  Proper diet and exercise can help lessen symptoms by keeping weight gain under control and strengthening and toning your abdominal muscles. After the first trimester, avoid exercises that involve lying on the back for a prolonged time. A pregnancy girdle or sling can help support your abdomen. Wear comfortable shoes that are not too tight, particularly if you have swelling of the legs. Exercise caution when lifting your other children or heavy objects. Be sure to bend the knees when lifting and try to keep the back straight. Sleep on a firm mattress. Lying on your side with a pillow between your legs may be a comfortable position that provides some relief. Wear a bra that provides good support if breasts are tender or sore. Eat lots of fiber to keep the bowels moving and avoid constipation. This means fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Taking fiber or stool softeners may help. Eat small, frequent meals to combat nausea, and avoid foods that trigger nausea. Avoid fatty foods and drink plenty of fluids. Small, frequent meals can also help prevent heartburn."

Pregnancy Test Facts,"'*''Pregnancy'' test facts medically edited by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD' Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone in a woman's blood or urine: hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is produced when an egg implanted in the uterus. There are two types of pregnancy tests, one uses blood and the other uses urine (home tests); a quantitative blood test detects hCG earlier than a qualitative blood or urine test. Most home pregnancy tests detect hCG in a urine stream when, after a few minutes, a line or symbol appears if the test is positive (indicating pregnancy); most urine pregnancy test instructions urge a second test in a few days no matter what were the first results; follow package instructions – if a control indicator does not appear, the test result should not be trusted. Home tests are accurate, some better (more sensitive in showing early pregnancy) than others. Home pregnancy tests may test positive on the first day of a missed period, but almost all detect pregnancy 1 week after a missed period. Call your doctor for an appointment if you test positive for pregnancy with a home test. It is possible to be pregnant and have a negative home pregnancy test; that is why you should wait about a week to repeat the test. Most medicines and other compounds (alcohol, drugs) do not interfere with pregnancy tests; however, any drug containing hCG (some fertility drugs) may give false test results. Any questions or problems with pregnancy tests should be discussed with your doctor."
How do pregnancy tests work?,"'All pregnancy tests work by detecting a certain hormone in the urine or blood that is only there when a woman is pregnant. This hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (kohr-ee-ON-ihk goh-NAD-uh-TROH-puhn), or hCG. It is also called the pregnancy hormone.''hCG is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. This usually happens about six days after the egg and sperm merge. But studies show that in up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until much later, after the first day of the missed period. The amount of hCG rapidly builds up in your body with each passing day you are pregnant. '  "
Are there different types of pregnancy tests?,"""Yes. There are two types of pregnancy tests. One tests the blood for the pregnancy hormone, hCG. You need to see a doctor to have a blood test. The other checks the urine for the hCG hormone. You can do a urine test at a doctor's office or at home with a home pregnancy test (HPT).""""These days, many women first use an HPT to find out if they are pregnant. HPTs are inexpensive, private, and easy to use. HPTs also are highly accurate if used correctly and at the right time. HPTs will be able to tell if you're pregnant about one week after a missed period.  ""'Doctors use two types of blood tests to check for pregnancy. Blood tests can pick up hCG earlier in a pregnancy than urine tests can. Blood tests can tell if you are pregnant about six to eight days after you ovulate (or release an egg from an ovary). A quantitative blood test (or the beta hCG test) measures the exact amount of hCG in your blood. So it can find even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate. A qualitative hCG blood test just checks to see if the pregnancy hormone is present or not. So this test gives a yes or no answer. The qualitative hCG blood test is about as accurate as a urine test.'  "
How do you do a home pregnancy test?,"'There are many different types of home pregnancy tests (HPTs). Most drugstores sell HPTs over the counter. They are inexpensive. But the cost depends on the brand and how many tests come in the box.''Most HPTs work in a similar way. Many instruct the user to hold a stick in the urine stream. Others involve collecting urine in a cup and then dipping the stick into it. At least one brand tells the woman to collect urine in a cup and then use a dropper to put a few drops of the urine into a special container. Then the woman needs to wait a few minutes. Different brands instruct the woman to wait different amounts of time. Once the time has passed, the user should inspect the ""result window."" If a line or plus symbol appears, you are pregnant. It does not matter how faint the line is. A line, whether bold or faint, means the result is positive. New digital tests show the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant.""''Most tests also have a ""control indicator"" in the result window. This line or symbol shows whether the test is working properly. If the control indicator does not appear, the test is not working properly. You should not rely on any results from a HPT that may be faulty.'""Most brands tell users to repeat the test in a few days, no matter what the results. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) does not always mean you're not pregnant. All HPTs come with written instructions. Most tests also have toll-free phone numbers to call in case of questions about use or results."" "
How accurate are home pregnancy tests?,"'Home pregnancy tests (HPTs) can be quite accurate. But the accuracy depends on:' How you use them: Be sure to check the expiration date and follow the instructions. Wait ten minutes after taking the test to check the results window. Research suggests that waiting 10 minutes will give the most accurate result. When you use them: The amount of hCG or pregnancy hormone in your urine increases with time. So, the earlier after a missed period you take the test, the harder it is to spot the hCG. Many HPTs claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always detect the low levels of hCG usually present this early in pregnancy. And when they do, the results are often very faint. Most HPTs can accurately detect pregnancy one week after a missed period. Also, testing your urine first thing in the morning may boost the accuracy. Who uses them: Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. hCG only is produced once implantation occurs. In up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until after the first day of a missed period. So, HPTs will be accurate as soon as one day after a missed period for some women but not for others. The brand of test: Some HPTs are more sensitive than others. So, some tests are better than others at spotting hCG early on."
How soon after a missed period can I take a home pregnancy test and get an accurate result?,"'Many home pregnancy tests (HPTs) claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always spot pregnancy that early. And when they do, the results are often so faint they are misunderstood. If you can wait one week after your missed period, most HPTs will give you an accurate answer. Ask your doctor for a more sensitive test if you need to know earlier.'  "
My home pregnancy test says I am pregnant. What should I do next?,"'If a home pregnancy test is positive and shows that you are pregnant, you should call your doctor right away. Your doctor can use a more sensitive test along with a ''pelvic exam'"" to tell for sure if you're pregnant. Seeing your doctor early on in your pregnancy will help you and your baby stay healthy."" "
My home pregnancy test says I'm not pregnant. Might I still be pregnant?,"'Yes. So, most home pregnancy tests (HPTs) suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week if the result is negative.'""Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. So, the accuracy of HPT results varies from woman to woman. Other things can also affect the accuracy. Sometimes women get false negative results when they test too early in the pregnancy. This means that the test says you are not pregnant when you are. Other times, problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hCG in the urine.""'If your HPT is negative, test yourself again in a few days or one week. If you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant, talk with your doctor right away.' "
Can anything affect home pregnancy test results?,"'Most medicines should not affect the results of a home pregnancy test (HPT). This includes ''over-the-counter'' and prescription medicines, including ''birth control pills'"" and antibiotics. Only medicines that have the pregnancy hormone hCG in them can give a false positive test result. A false positive is when a test says you are pregnant when you're not. Sometimes medicines containing hCG are used to treat ""'infertility'' (not being able to get pregnant).''Alcohol and illegal drugs do not affect HPT results. But do not use these substances if you are trying to become pregnant or are sexually active and could become pregnant.' "
Tips for trying to conceive*,"'*Trying to conceive facts medically edited by: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD''This article offers tips for those desiring to have a baby, offers advice on what to do when trying to conceive to determine your fertile period, and discusses options for those who are having trouble conceiving.'   If you are trying to get pregnant (conceive), you have the best chance of success if you are aware of your menstrual cycle and changes that happen to your body during that time. It helps to know when you are fertile and able to get pregnant. A woman’s fertile time is usually a few days per month in the middle of her menstrual cycle and represents the time when a woman ovulates. There are three ways to track your fertile times: 1) basal body temperature method, 2) calendar method, and 3) cervical mucus method (ovulation method). Many women experience miscarriages or pregnancy losses, or cannot conceive at all (infertility). Infertility in women can be caused by age, health problems (like PCOS), uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and negative lifestyle factors. Infertility in men may be caused infertility in men are sperm gene defects, negative lifestyle choices (alcohol and drugs), toxins (lead, pesticides), STDs, diabetes, and prostate or testicle problems. There are several treatment options for infertile couples including drugs, surgery, intrauterine insemination (artificial insemination), assisted reproductive technology, third party assistance, adoption, and foster care."
When can a woman get pregnant during her menstrual cycle?,"'Being aware of your menstrual cycle and the changes in your body that happen during this time can help you know when you are most likely to get pregnant. See how the menstrual cycle works.''The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. But normal cycles can vary from 21 to 35 days. The amount of time before ovulation occurs is different in every woman and even can be different from month to month in the same woman, varying from 13 to 20 days long. Learning about this part of the cycle is important because it is when ovulation and pregnancy can occur. After ovulation, every woman (unless she has a health problem that affects her periods or becomes pregnant) will have a period within 14 to 16 days.'""Knowing when you're most fertile will help you plan or prevent pregnancy. There are three ways you can keep track of your fertile times. They are the: 1) basal body temperature method; 2) calendar method; and 3) ovulation method (cervical mucus method).""  "
Taking your temperature to conceive,"""Basal body temperature is your temperature at rest as soon as you awake in the morning. A woman's basal body temperature rises slightly with ovulation. So by recording this temperature daily for several months, you'll be able to predict your most fertile days.""'Basal body temperature differs slightly from woman to woman. Anywhere from 96 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit orally is average before ovulation. After ovulation most women have an oral temperature between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit. The rise in temperature can be a sudden jump or a gradual climb over a few days.'""Usually a woman's basal body temperature rises by only 0.4 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit. To detect this tiny change, women must use a basal body thermometer. These thermometers are very sensitive. Most pharmacies sell them for about $10.""""The rise in temperature doesn't show exactly when the egg is released. But almost all women have ovulated within three days after their temperatures spike. Body temperature stays at the higher level until your period starts.""'You are most fertile and most likely to get pregnant:'""A man's sperm can live for up to three days in a woman's body. The sperm can fertilize an egg at any point during that time. So if you have unprotected sex a few days before ovulation, you could get pregnant.""'Many things can affect basal body temperature. For your chart to be useful, make sure to take your temperature every morning at about the same time. Things that can alter your temperature include:''Drinking alcohol the night before' Two to three days before your temperature hits the highest point (ovulation) 12 to 24 hours after ovulation Smoking cigarettes the night before Getting a poor night's sleep Having a fever Doing anything in the morning before you take your temperature - including going to the bathroom and talking on the phone"
Using the calendar method to conceive,"'This involves recording your menstrual cycle on a calendar for eight to 12 months. The first day of your period is Day 1. Circle Day 1 on the calendar. The length of your cycle may vary from month to month. So write down the total number of days it lasts each time. Using this record, you can find the days you are most fertile in the months ahead:''This method always should be used along with other ''fertility awareness'' methods, especially if your cycles are not always the same length.' To find out the first day when you are most fertile, subtract 18 from the total number of days in your shortest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The X marks the first day you're likely to be fertile. To find out the last day when you are most fertile, subtract 11 from the total number of days in your longest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The time between the two Xs is your most fertile window."
Using the ovulation method to conceive,"'The cervical mucus method (also known as the ovulation method) involves being aware of the changes in your cervical mucus throughout the month. The hormones that control the menstrual cycle also change the kind and amount of mucus you have before and during ovulation. Right after your period, there are usually a few days when there is no mucus present or ""dry days."" As the egg starts to mature, mucus increases in the vagina, appears at the vaginal opening, and is white or yellow and cloudy and sticky. The greatest amount of mucus appears just before ovulation. During these ""wet days"" it becomes clear and slippery, like raw egg whites. Sometimes it can be stretched apart. This is when you are most fertile. About four days after the wet days begin the mucus changes again. There will be much less and it becomes sticky and cloudy. You might have a few more dry days before your period returns. Describe changes in your mucus on a calendar. Label the days, ""Sticky,"" ""Dry,"" or ""Wet."" You are most fertile at the first sign of wetness after your period or a day or two before wetness begins.''The cervical mucus method is less reliable for some women. Women who are ''breastfeeding'', taking hormonal ''birth control'' (like ''the pill''), using feminine hygiene products, have ''vaginitis'' or sexually transmitted infections (STIs or ''STDs''), or have had surgery on the cervix should not rely on this method.'

When to see your doctor if you are having problems getting pregnant,"'Happily, doctors are able to help many ''infertile'' couples go on to have ''babies''.' You are younger than 35 and have not been able to conceive after one year of frequent sex without birth control. You are age 35 or older and have not been able to conceive after six months of frequent sex without birth control. You believe you or your partner might have fertility problems in the future (even before you begin trying to get pregnant). You or your partner has a problem with sexual function or libido."
What is infertility?,"'Some women want children but either cannot conceive or keep miscarrying. This is called infertility. Lots of couples have infertility problems. About one-third of the time, it is a female problem. In another one-third of cases, it is the man with the fertility problem. For the remaining one-third, both partners have fertility challenges or no cause is found.' "
What causes of infertility in women?,"'Some common reasons for infertility in women include:''Age:'"" Women generally have some decrease in fertility starting in their early 30s. And while many women in their 30s and 40s have no problems getting pregnant, fertility especially declines after age 35. As a woman ages, normal changes that occur in her ovaries and eggs make it harder to become pregnant. Even though menstrual cycles continue to be regular in a woman's 30s and 40s, the eggs that ovulate each month are of poorer quality than those from her 20s. It is harder to get pregnant when the eggs are poorer in quality. As a woman nears ""'menopause'', the ovaries may not release an egg each month, which also can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, as a woman and her eggs age, she is more likely to miscarry, as well as have a baby with genetic problems, such as ''Down syndrome''.''Health problems:'' Some women have diseases or conditions that affect their hormone levels, which can cause infertility.''Polycystic ovay syndrome (''PCOS'')'': Women with PCOS rarely or never ovulate. Failure to ovulate is the most common cause of infertility in women.''With ''primary ovarian insufficiency'"" (POI), a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. It is not the same as early ""'menopause''. Some women with POI get a period now and then. But getting pregnant is hard for women with POI.''A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in ''miscarriage''.''Reproductive problems:'"" Common problems with a woman's reproductive organs, like ""'uterine fibroids'', ''endometriosis'', and ''pelvic inflammatory disease'"" (PID) can worsen with age and also affect fertility. These conditions might cause the fallopian tubes to be blocked, so the egg can't travel through the tubes into the uterus.""'Lifestyle factors:'"" Certain lifestyle factors also can have a negative effect on a woman's fertility. Examples include ""'smoking'', alcohol use, weighing much more or much less than an ideal body weight, a lot of strenuous ''exercise'', and having an eating disorder. ''Stress'' also can affect fertility.'  "
What causes infertility in men?,"""Unlike women, some men remain fertile into their 60s and 70s. But as men age, they might begin to have problems with the shape and movement of their sperm. They also have a slightly higher risk of sperm gene defects. Or they might produce no sperm, or too few sperm. Lifestyle choices also can affect the number and quality of a man's sperm. Alcohol and drugs can temporarily reduce sperm quality. And researchers are looking at whether environmental toxins, such as pesticides and lead, also may be to blame for some cases of infertility. Men also can have health problems that affect their sexual and reproductive function. These can include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ""'diabetes'', surgery on the ''prostate gland'', or a severe testicle injury or problem.'  "
What is the treatment for infertility?,"'If you are having fertility issues, your doctor can refer you to a fertility specialist, a doctor who treats infertility. The doctor will need to test both you and your partner to find out what the problem is. Depending on the problem, your doctor might recommend treatment. About 9 in 10 cases of infertility are treated with drugs or surgery. '""Don't delay seeing your doctor as age also affects the success rates of these treatments. ""'For some couples, adoption or foster care offers a way to share their love with a child and to build a family.''Some treatments include:''Drugs:'"" Various fertility drugs may be used for women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the drug to be used. You should understand the drug's benefits and side effects. Depending on the type of fertility drug and the dosage of the drug used, multiple births (such as twins) can occur.""'Surgery:'"" Surgery is done to repair damage to a woman's ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus. Sometimes a man has an infertility problem that can be corrected by surgery.""'Intrauterine insemination (IUI, artificial insemination):'"" Male sperm is injected into part of the woman's reproductive tract, such as into the uterus or fallopian tube. IUI often is used along with drugs that cause a woman to ovulate.""'Assisted reproductive technology (ART):'"" ART involves stimulating a woman's ovaries; removing eggs from her body; mixing them with sperm in the laboratory; and putting the embryos back into a woman's body. Success rates of ART vary and depend on many factors.""'Third party assistance:'' Options include donor eggs (eggs from another woman are used), donor sperm (sperm from another man are used), or surrogacy (when another woman carries a baby for you).''Finding the cause of infertility is often a long, complex, and emotional process. And treatment can be expensive. Many health insurance companies do not provide coverage for infertility or provide only limited coverage. Check your health insurance contract carefully to learn about what is covered. Some states have laws that mandate health insurance policies to provide infertility coverage.'  "
What other options are available if a couple can't conceive?,"""If infertility is a problem for you, another option may be adoption. Adopting a baby or child can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. So many babies, children, and adolescents in the United States and around the world need a family. Some of these are healthy infants, and many are children with special needs, including physical, emotional, or mental disabilities. If you do adopt a child with special needs, there are both federal and state sources of financial assistance available to help you afford the child's care.""'There are two types of adoptions:''The laws of each state differ on whether, after a period of time, the files of a closed adoption can be opened later to reveal this information. State laws also differ on whether adoptions can be handled by an adoption agency or independently (such as through a doctor, lawyer, counselor or independent organization). Most adoption agencies carefully screen and study the adoptive parents. You can learn more about adoption through the resources at the end of this section.''Another option for couples who have a lot of love to share with a child is foster care. Unlike adoption, foster care is a temporary service that responds to crises in the lives of children and families. But it also can be the first step to adopting a child. Many foster children have been abused or neglected, or removed by a court order. Foster families are people who take these children into their homes to provide day-to-day care and nurturing. Children in foster care may live with unrelated foster parents, with relatives, with families who plan to adopt them, or in group homes or residential treatment centers. Even though foster care is viewed as a temporary service, many children have to stay in foster care for long periods of time.''Each child in foster care should have a plan that will let him or her grow up in a permanent family. For many children, the plan is to return to the birth parents. In these cases, foster families may work with the birth parents and the child to help them both learn the skills they need to live together again. Foster parents need to be able to love the children who live in their home, and let go of them when it is time to send them back to their parents. For other children, going back to their parents will not be possible, and the foster parents may become adoptive parents. Or they can keep other kinds of formal or informal ties with the children they parent.''Every state has its own rules about foster ''parenting''. But, the chances are good that you can be a foster parent in your state. There are many more children in need of care than there are foster parents available. To fill this gap, states are looking for people who want to help children and can share their time and their homes. States also give foster parents many different forms of support, like training and financial assistance.'  Open adoption: The birth mother, and possibly the birth father, know something about the adoptive parents. They might even meet and exchange names or addresses. Closed adoption: The birth mother and adoptive parents do not meet each other or know each others' names."
Counseling and support groups for help ,"""If you've been having problems getting pregnant, you know how frustrating it can feel. Not being able to get pregnant can be one of the most stressful experiences a couple has. Both counseling and support groups can help you and your partner talk about your feelings and help you meet other couples struggling with the same issues. You will learn that anger, ""'grief'', blame, guilt, and ''depression'' are all normal. Couples do survive infertility, and can become closer and stronger in the process. Ask your doctor for the names of counselors or therapists with an interest in fertility.' "
What should I know about ectopic pregnancy?,"'An ''ectopic pregnancy'' is a ''pregnancy'' located outside the inner lining of the uterus. The Fallopian tubes are the most common locations for an ectopic pregnancy.''The three symptoms (characteristics) of ectopic pregnancy are ''abdominal pain'', absence of menstrual periods (''amenorrhea''), and ''vaginal bleeding''. However, only about 50% of women have all three of these symptoms.''Ectopic or ''tubal pregnancy'' is caused when a fertilized egg lodges in a Fallopian tube or other location instead of continuing its journey to the uterus, where it is supposed to implant. The egg can become stuck when a Fallopian tube is damaged, scarred, or distorted.''Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include previous ectopic ''pregnancies'' and conditions (surgery, infection) that disrupt the normal anatomy of the Fallopian tubes. The major health risk of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to ''internal bleeding''.''Ectopic pregnancy occurs in 1%-2% of all pregnancies.''Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is usually established by blood hormone tests and pelvic ''ultrasound''.''Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include both surgery and medication.'  "
What is the medical definition of ectopic pregnancy?,'An ectopic pregnancy is an early pregnancy that occurs outside of the normal location (uterine lining) for a developing pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy cannot progress normally and typically results in the death of the embryo or fetus.' 
What is an ectopic pregnancy? What does an ectopic pregnancy look like (picture)?,"'An ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a condition in which a fertilized egg settles and grows in any location other than the inner lining of the uterus. The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies are so-called tubal pregnancies and occur in the Fallopian tube. However, they can occur in other locations, such as the ovary, cervix, and abdominal ''cavity''. An ectopic pregnancy occurs in about one in 1%-2% of all pregnancies. A molar pregnancy differs from an ectopic pregnancy in that it is usually a mass of tissue derived from an egg with incomplete genetic information that grows in the uterus in a grape-like mass that can cause symptoms to those of pregnancy.''The major health risk of ectopic pregnancy is rupture leading to internal bleeding. Before the 19th century, the mortality rate (death rate) from ectopic pregnancies exceeded 50%. By the end of the 19th century, the mortality rate dropped to five percent because of surgical intervention. Statistics suggest that with current advances in early detection, the mortality rate has improved to less than five in 10,000. The survival rate from ectopic pregnancies is improving even though the incidence of ectopic pregnancies is also increasing. The major reason for a poor outcome is failure to seek early medical attention. Ectopic pregnancy remains the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.''In rare cases, an ectopic pregnancy may occur at the same time as an intrauterine pregnancy. This is referred to as heterotopic pregnancy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has risen in recent years due to the increasing use of ''IVF'' (''in vitro fertilization'') and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs).''For additional diagrams and photos, please see the last reference listed below.' "
What are the early and later signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy?,"'The woman may not be aware that she is ''pregnant''. The three classic signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include ''abdominal pain'', the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and ''vaginal bleeding'' or intermittent bleeding (''spotting''). The however, about 50% of females with an ectopic pregnancy will not have all three signs. These characteristic symptoms occur in ruptured ectopic pregnancies (those accompanied by severe internal bleeding) and non-ruptured ectopic pregnancies. However, while these symptoms are typical for an ectopic pregnancy, they do not mean an ectopic pregnancy is necessarily present and could represent other conditions. In fact, these symptoms also occur with a threatened abortion (''miscarriage'') in nonectopic pregnancies.''The signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy typically occur six to eight weeks after the last normal ''menstrual period'', but they may occur later if the ectopic pregnancy is not located in the Fallopian tube. Other ''symptoms of pregnancy'' (for example, ''nausea'' and breast discomfort, etc.) may also be present in ectopic pregnancy. ''Weakness'', ''dizziness'', and a sense of passing out upon standing can (also termed near-''syncope'') be signs of serious internal bleeding and ''low blood pressure'' from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and require immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, some women with a bleeding ectopic pregnancy do not recognize they have symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Their diagnosis is delayed until the woman shows signs of ''shock'' (for example, ''low blood pressure'', weak and rapid pulse, ''pale skin'' and ''confusion'') and often is brought to an emergency department.'' This situation is a medical emergency.'  "
What are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Age:'' Ectopic pregnancy can occur in any woman, of any age, who is ovulating and is sexually active with a male partner. The highest likelihood ectopic pregnancy occurs in women aged 35-44 years.''History:'' The greatest risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy is a prior history of an ectopic pregnancy.''Fallopian tube abnormalities:'' Any disruption of the normal architecture of the Fallopian tubes can be a risk factor for a tubal pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy in other locations.''Previous gynecological surgeries:'' Previous surgery on the Fallopian tubes such as tubal sterilization or reconstructive, procedures can lead to scarring and disruption of the normal anatomy of the tubes and increases the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.''Infections:'' Infection in the pelvis (''pelvic inflammatory disease'') is another risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic infections are usually caused by sexually-transmitted organism, such as ''Chlamydia'' or ''N. gonorrhoeae'', the bacteria that cause ''gonorrhea''. However, non-sexually transmitted bacteria can also cause pelvic infection and increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Infection causes an ectopic pregnancy by damaging or obstructing the Fallopian tubes. Normally, the inner lining of the Fallopian tubes is coated with small hair-like projections called cilia. These cilia are important to transport the egg smoothly from the ovary through the Fallopian tube and into the uterus. If these cilia are damaged by infection, egg transport becomes disrupted. The fertilized egg can settle in the Fallopian tube without reaching the uterus, thus becoming an ectopic pregnancy. Likewise, infection-related scarring and partial blockage of the Fallopian tubes can also prevent the egg from reaching the uterus.''Multiple sex partners:'"" Because having multiple sexual partners increases a woman's risk of pelvic infections, multiple sexual partners also are associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.""'Gynecological conditions:'' Like pelvic infections, conditions such as ''endometriosis'', ''fibroid'' tumors, or pelvic ''scar tissue'' (pelvic adhesions), can narrow the Fallopian tubes and disrupt egg transportation, thereby increasing the chances of an ectopic pregnancy.''IUD'' use:'' Approximately half of pregnancies in women using intrauterine devices (IUDs) will be located outside of the uterus. However, the total number of women ''becoming pregnant'' while using IUDs is extremely low. Therefore, the overall number of ectopic pregnancies related to IUDs is very low.''Cigarette smoking'':'' ''Cigarette smoking'' around the time of ''conception'"" has also been associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. This risk was observed to be dose-dependent, which means that the risk is dependent upon the individual woman's habits and increases with the number of cigarettes smoked.""'Infertility'':'' A history of ''infertility'' for two or more years also is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.'""Other causes: Infection, congenital abnormalities, or tumors of the Fallopian tubes can increase a woman's risk of having an ectopic pregnancy.""  "
Is there a test to diagnose ectopic pregnancy?,"'The first step in the diagnosis is an interview and examination by the doctor. The usual second step is to obtain a qualitative (positive or negative for pregnancy) or quantitative (measures hormone levels) ''pregnancy test''. Occasionally, the doctor may feel a tender mass during the pelvic examination. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the combination of blood hormone ''pregnancy tests'' and pelvic ultrasound can usually help to establish the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is the most useful test to visualize an ectopic pregnancy. In this test, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina, and pelvic images are visible on a monitor. Transvaginal ultrasound can reveal the gestational sac in either a normal (intrauterine) pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy, but often the findings are not conclusive. Rather than a gestational sac containing a visible embryo, the examination may simply reveal a mass in the area of the Fallopian tubes or elsewhere that is suggestive of, but not conclusive for, an ectopic pregnancy. The ultrasound can also demonstrate the absence of pregnancy within the uterus.''Pregnancy tests are designed to detect specific hormones; the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta HCG) blood levels are also used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Beta HCG levels normally rise during pregnancy. An abnormal pattern in the rise of this hormone can be a clue to the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. In rare cases, ''laparoscopy'' may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. During laparoscopy, viewing instruments are inserted through small incisions in the abdominal wall to visualize the structures in the abdomen and pelvis, thereby revealing the site of the ectopic pregnancy.'  "
Is an ectopic pregnancy dangerous? Can you die from it?,"'Some women spontaneously absorb the fetus from the ectopic pregnancy, and have no apparent side effects. In these instances, the woman can be observed without treatment. However, the true incidence of spontaneous resolution of ectopic pregnancies is unknown. It is not possible to predict which women will spontaneously resolve their ectopic pregnancies.''The most feared complication of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to internal bleeding, pelvic and ''abdominal pain'', shock, and even death. Therefore, bleeding in an ectopic pregnancy may require immediate surgical attention. Bleeding results from the rupture of the Fallopian tube or from blood leaking from the end of the tube as the growing placenta erodes into the veins and arteries located inside the tubal wall. Blood coming from the tube can be very irritating to other tissues and organs in the pelvis and abdomen, and result in significant ''pain''. The pelvic blood can lead to ''scar'' tissue formation that can result in problems with becoming pregnant in the future. The scar tissue can also increase the risk of future ectopic pregnancies.''Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are the specialists who typically treat ectopic pregnancies. However, ''emergency medicine'' specialists and surgeons treat ruptured ectopic pregnancies. If you think you may have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy go to your nearest emergency room right away.' "
What are the treatments for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include observation, laparoscopy, laparotomy, and medication. Selection of these options is individualized. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve on their own without the need for any intervention, while others will need urgent surgery due to life-threatening bleeding. However, because of the risk of rupture and potential dire consequences, most women with a diagnosed ectopic pregnancy are treated with medications or surgery.''For those who require intervention, the most common treatment is surgery. Two surgical options are available; laparotomy and laparoscopy. Laparotomy is an open procedure whereby a transverse (bikini line) incision is made across the lower abdomen. Laparoscopy involves inserting viewing instruments into the pelvis through tiny incisions in the skin. For many surgeons and patients, laparoscopy is preferred over laparotomy because of the tiny incisions used and the speedy recovery afterwards. Under optimal conditions, a small incision can be made in the Fallopian tube and the ectopic pregnancy removed, leaving the Fallopian tube intact. However, certain conditions make laparoscopy less effective or unavailable as an alternative. These include massive pelvic scar tissue and excessive blood in the abdomen or pelvis. In some instances, the location or extent of damage may require removal of a portion of the Fallopian tube, the entire tube, the ovary, and even the uterus.'  "
What medications treat ectopic pregnancy? Can an ectopic pregnancy go full term?,"'Medical therapy can also be successful in treating certain groups of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. Medical treatment method involves the use of an anti-''cancer'' drug called ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). This drug acts by killing the growing cells of the placenta, thereby inducing miscarriage of the ectopic pregnancy. Some patients may not respond to methotrexate, and will require surgical treatment. Methotrexate is gaining popularity because of its high success rate and low rate of side effects.''There are certain factors, including the size of the mass associated with the ectopic pregnancy and the blood beta HCG concentrations that help doctors decide which women are candidates for medical rather than surgical treatment. The optimal candidates for methotrexate treatment are women with a beta-subunit (HCG) concentration less than or equal to 5000 mIU/mL. In a properly selected patient population, methotrexate therapy is about 90% effective in treating ectopic pregnancy. There is no evidence that the use of this drug causes any adverse effects in subsequent pregnancies. Additional tests (HCG) are usually ordered to confirm that methotrexate treatment is effective.''Although there have been a few reported cases of women giving birth by cesarean section to live infants that were located outside the uterus, this is extremely rare. The chance of carrying an ectopic pregnancy to full term is so remote, and the risk to the woman so great, that it can never be recommended. It would be ideal if an ectopic pregnancy in the Fallopian tube could be saved by surgery to relocate it into the uterus. This concept has yet to become accepted as a successful procedure. Overall, there have been great advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy, and the death rate from this condition has decreased dramatically.' "
What is prenatal ultrasound?,"'Like other ''ultrasound'' examinations, ''prenatal'' or fetal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac in a ''pregnant'' woman. The test does not involve ''radiation'' and is completely safe for both mother and baby. An ultrasound examination is also known as a ''sonogram''. The entire procedure can be performed in 30 minutes or less.\xa0Two types of ultrasound exams are used in ''pregnancy''.''Two types of ultrasound exams are used in pregnancy. The most common is a transabdominal ultrasound, in which the measuring instrument (transducer) is moved over the surface of the abdomen after a gel has been applied. Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is no ''pain'"" or discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.""""Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination. This type of exam is most commonly used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out suspected problems or to assess the gestational age of the embryo. In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.""  Transabdominal ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound"
Why is prenatal ultrasound performed?,"'As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Major ''birth defects'' can be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.''Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:' Determination of multiple gestation Ensuring the health of the baby and 
monitoring its growth Determining the location of the 
placenta Estimation of gestational age and due 
date Assessing the expected size and weight 
of the baby Determining the amount of amniotic 
fluid Determining the position of the baby"
What are 3D and 4D ultrasound?,"'A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations. Medical authorities, including The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug Administration do not recommend using these services because the examiners may not have received proper training and could provide inaccurate information.' "
Are there risks associated with prenatal ultrasound?,"'As mentioned before, there is no radiation exposure during a prenatal ultrasound. Ultrasound exams have been used for many years, and studies have never shown any harms associated with the procedure, either on a short- or long-term basis.' "
How can I tell if it is PMS or if I am pregnant?,"'Many women have difficulty figuring out if they are ''pregnant'', have ''PMS'', or are about to start their period. The most common signs and symptoms of early ''pregnancy'', ''PMS'', and the start of your period include ''mood swings'', ''back pain'', ''increased urination'', and tender breasts. These three conditions also share other similar signs and symptoms, but there are unique differences between each. Moreover, there are symptoms that only occur if you are pregnant.''The only way to find out if you are pregnant is with a ''pregnancy test''. Home ''pregnancy test'' kits are available without a prescription at pharmacies and most grocery stores.'  "
What is PMS (premenstrual syndrome)?,"'Menstruation'' (period) is the process of bleeding from the vagina (known as the ''menstrual period'') that occurs at the end of each ''menstrual cycle''. ''Menstruation'' begins during ''puberty'' and lasts until ''menopause''. Your period starts when the lining of the uterus sheds (approximately every 28 days) because ''pregnancy'' did not occur. Your ''menstrual period'' is due to the normal variation in levels of the hormones estrogen and ''progesterone'', known as the ''menstrual cycle''. Many women experience symptoms including cramping, ''bloating'', breast tenderness, and ''mood changes'' around the time of the ''menstrual period''.''PMS'', or ''premenstrual syndrome'', is a condition characterized by psychological and physical symptoms that develop at some point after you ovulate (which occurs during the middle of the menstrual cycle), and ends when you start your period. ''Symptoms of PMS'' can include irritability, ''depression'', crying, ''fatigue'', ''bloating'', ''acne'', breast tenderness (''mastalgia''), and appetite changes including food cravings. While 90% of women are believed to have some symptoms associated with ''menstruation'', true PMS is more severe and likely occurs in 20% to 30% of women.' "
Similarities between PMS vs. pregnancy symptoms and signs,"'For many women, the signs and symptoms of early pregnancy can resemble those of her approaching ''menstrual period'' or PMS. In fact, it is not possible to tell from early symptoms alone if a woman is pregnant or having symptoms related to her upcoming menstrual period.''The most similar common signs and symptoms that these conditions share include:' Headaches: Headaches can be a symptom of pregnancy, but many women also experience headaches or migraines prior to the menstrual period or with PMS. Back pain: This symptom can be if your period is approaching, but it also can be a symptom that you are pregnant. Mood changes (irritability, anxiety, crying spells): Mood changes are common in both PMS and early pregnancy. These changes can include depression, anxiety, irritability, and mood swings. Constipation: The hormone progesterone can lead to digestive disturbances including constipation. Because levels of progesterone rise during the second half of the menstrual cycle, constipation can be present in women with PMS or an approaching menstrual period. Likewise, the hormonal changes of early pregnancy may also cause constipation. Increased urination: You may have increased urination if you are pregnant or your about to have your period. Breast pain and tenderness: Breast pain, tenderness, breast swelling, or enlargement, can occur in early pregnancy as well as prior to your period. The breasts may feel heavy, sore, or sensitive in both conditions."
Differences between PMS vs. pregnancy signs and symptoms," Bleeding or spotting: Mild spotting (not enough bleeding to soak a pad or tampon) sometimes occurs around the time of implantation of the embryo into the uterus in early pregnancy. This is known as implantation bleeding. This is not the same as the heavy bleeding some women may experience at the beginning of her period. Fatigue: Fatigue is common in women in the early stages of pregnancy, but it also occurs as a sign of PMS in many women. However, the fatigue of PMS generally goes away once the period starts. Food cravings/aversions: Many women experience food cravings or increased appetite prior to the onset of her period. Food cravings and aversions also are typical of pregnancy, although the food cravings of pregnancy are often more specific and intense than during PMS or prior to menstruation. Nausea and or vomiting: Nausea and vomiting are more typical of early pregnancy and are not common symptoms of PMS or an approaching menstrual period. Therefore, if you are pregnant you are more likely to experience these symptoms. Cramping: Abdominal or pelvic cramping and pain occur in many women prior to, or even during her menstrual period. These symptoms often are particularly troublesome for women with PMS. However, some women may have mild cramping in the early stages of pregnancy."
What symptoms and signs are unique to pregnancy?,"'Certain symptoms are more characteristic of early pregnancy, and are less likely to occur due to an impending menstrual period or PMS.'   Missed or late period: The absence of menstruation is the hallmark symptom of pregnancy. Implantation bleeding or cramping: As discussed previously, there may be very mild bleeding and cramping at the time of implantation of the embryo in the uterus during early pregnancy. This is very different from the normal menstrual flow. Vaginal discharge: Increased estrogen production in pregnancy may lead to an increase in milky, white vaginal discharge. Darkening of the areola or nipple: Darkening or enlargement of the areola or nipple can occur as early as a week or two after conception in early pregnancy. It also may develop later in pregnancy. This is not a sign of PMS or approaching menstruation."
What is the 2-week wait?,"'The ""2-week wait"" is a term that has been used to describe the time interval between ''ovulation'' and implantation, or the approximate point at which a pregnancy test will yield a definitive answer. Many tests available on the market today are able to determine if you are pregnant, even before the date of the expected menstrual period.' "
Introduction to parenting and birthing classes,"""First-time mothers-to-be often have lots of questions and even some worries: How will I know I'm in ""'labor''? Will it hurt? Will my baby know how to breastfeed? How do I care for a ''newborn''? Classes to prepare you for ''childbirth'', ''breastfeeding'', infant care, and ''parenting'' are great ways to lessen ''anxiety'' and build confidence. In some cities, classes might be offered in different languages. ' "
Birthing Classes,"'Birthing classes often are offered through local hospitals and birthing centers. Some classes follow a specific method, such as ''Lamaze'' or the Bradley method. Others review ''labor'' techniques from a variety of methods. You might want to read about the different methods beforehand to see if one appeals more to you than others. That way, you will know what to sign up for if more than one type of birthing class if offered. Try to sign up for a class several months before your due date. Classes sometimes fill up quickly. Also, make sure the instructor is qualified.''You should discuss with your healthcare professional in advance of delivery about yor preferred birth method and plan.''Most women attend the class with the person who will provide support during ''labor'', such as a spouse, family member, or good friend. This person is sometimes called the ''labor'' coach. During class, the instructor will go over the signs of labor and review the stages of labor. She will talk about positioning for labor and birth, and ways to control ''pain''. She also will give you strategies to work through labor pains and to help you stay relaxed and in control. You will practice many of these strategies in class, so you are ready when the big day arrives. Many classes also provide a tour of the birthing facility.' "
Breastfeeding classes,"'Like any new skill, breastfeeding takes knowledge and practice to be successful. ''Pregnant'"" women who learn about how to breastfeed are more likely to be successful than those who do not. Breastfeeding classes offer pregnant women and their partners the chance to prepare and ask questions before the baby's arrival. Classes may be offered through hospitals, breastfeeding support programs, La Leche League, or local lactation consultants. Ask your doctor for help finding a breastfeeding class in your area."" "
Parenting Classes,"'Many first-time parents have never cared for a newborn. Hospitals, community education centers, and places of worship sometimes offer baby care classes. These classes cover the basics, such as diapering, feeding, and bathing your newborn. The American Red Cross offers such courses as ""Family ''First Aid''"" and ""CPR Online - Pediatric.""''You also will learn these basic skills in the hospital before you are discharged.'""In some communities parenting classes are available. Children don't come with how-to manuals. So some parents appreciate learning about the different stages of child development, as well as practical skills for dealing with common issues, such as discipline or parent-child power struggles. Counselors and social workers often teach this type of class. If you are interested in parenting programs, ask your child's doctor for help finding a class in your area.""'Did you know?'' Some hospitals and birthing centers offer sibling classes for soon-to-be brothers and sisters. These classes often help small children get ready for a new baby using fun games and activities. ' "
What should you know about bleeding during pregnancy?,"'Vaginal bleeding'' or ''spotting'' during the ''first trimester'' of ''pregnancy'' is relatively common. Some amount of light bleeding or ''spotting'' during ''pregnancy'' occurs in about 20% of ''pregnancies'', and most of these women go on to have a healthy pregnancy.''Implantation bleeding is bleeding that occurs when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. This happens around the time of the expected ''menstrual period''. Implantation bleeding may occur before a woman realizes she is ''pregnant''. What are the serious causes of ''vaginal bleeding'' in the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy?''Causes for severe bleeding during pregnancy include ''miscarriage'', threatened ''miscarriage'', and ''ectopic pregnancy''. If you are ''pregnant'' and have ''vaginal bleeding'', call 911 and go to the emergency department.'  "
How much bleeding is normal during pregnancy?,"'Vaginal bleeding'' during the first three months of pregnancy is relatively common and usually is a cause of concern for the mother. Women wonder how much bleeding during early pregnancy is normal. While early bleeding may indicate the presence of a serious problem, this is frequently not the case. In fact, approximately 20% of pregnant women experience light bleeding or spotting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Most women go on to have uncomplicated ''pregnancies'' and ultimately deliver a healthy baby.''Spotting:'' Spotting usually refers to a few drops of blood that would not cover a pad or panty liner. Bleeding refers to blood flow that is heavy enough to require wearing a pad. If bleeding occurs during the first trimester, wear a panty liner or pad so that you are able to get an idea of the amount of bleeding that is occurring and can tell the health care professional. However, you should not use a tampon in the vagina or ''douche'' during pregnancy.' "
What other problems cause bleeding during early pregnancy (first trimester)?,"'Changes in the cervix: ''The normal hormone production during pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, rendering it softer and more prone to bleeding. In addition, a cervical polyp (a benign overgrowth of tissue) may form, and this may bleed more easily during pregnancy. In both cases, spotting or light bleeding may be provoked following sexual intercourse or a pelvic examination.''Infection:'' A ''vaginal infection'' may cause spontaneous vaginal bleeding during pregancy. The bleeding may be accompanied by an abnormal ''vaginal discharge''.' "
What causes heavy bleeding during early pregnancy (first trimester)?,"'Vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy may sometimes indicate a serious problem. Serious causes of bleeding in pregnancy include:'   Bleeding, abdominal pain, and back pain are common signs of miscarriage. An exam shows that the cervix is open. Tissue may be extruded through the cervix and vagina. A miscarriage occurs in an estimated 15% to 20% of pregnancies, usually during the first 12 weeks of gestation. A genetic defect confined to the specific embryo in question represents the most common cause of miscarriage. Few circumstances exist wherein a miscarriage in progress can be prevented. Molar pregnancy, also known as gestational trophoblastic disease or hydatidiform mole, is an abnormality of fertilization that results in the growth of abnormal tissue within the uterus. Molar pregnancy is not a typical pregnancy, but the growth within the uterus leads to the typical symptoms of early pregnancy. In a complete hydatiform mole, there is only abnormal tissue in the uterus (and no fetus). In a so-called partial mole, there is abnormal tissue growth along with the presence of a fetus with severe birth defects. The fetus is typically consumed by the abnormal growth of tissue in the uterus, and a molar pregnancy cannot result in a normal fetus or delivery. Vaginal spotting or bleeding can be a symptom of molar pregnancy. A sonogram or ultrasound is used to diagnose a molar pregnancy. Mild vaginal bleeding and increasing abdominal pain may indicate the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs in approximately 1 out of 60 pregnancies. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, where the blood supply is inadequate to sustain the growth of a normal pregnancy. In the majority of cases of ectopic pregnancy, the embryo is located within one of the Fallopian tubes; this sometimes is referred to as a tubal pregnancy. As the pregnancy grows and the tube distends, abdominal pain becomes increasingly severe. Sometimes these pregnancies can actually rupture the Fallopian tube, leading to significant blood loss. In some cases, a blood transfusion and emergency surgery are needed for prompt resolution of this potentially life-threatening condition. If a woman is bleeding during the first trimester of pregnancy, the possibility of a miscarriage must be ruled out. Symptoms of a threatened miscarriage are bleeding and mild cramping, but the cervix stays closed and the fetus is still viable. In many women, the bleeding stops and the pregnancy continues. For others, the bleeding continues, and they eventually have a miscarriage (i.e. spontaneous pregnancy loss). Despite many articles in the lay press, there is no evidence that restriction of physical activity will aid in preventing a pregnancy loss. In this condition, blood collects between the gestational sac and the wall of the uterus. At times, the intrauterine clot can be seen on ultrasound examination. The body frequently reabsorbs these blood clots; however, occasionally there may be passage of old dark blood or even small clots from the vagina."
What is implantation bleeding during the first trimester? ,'A common benign cause of bleeding may occur even before a woman realizes that she is pregnant. Many women bleed when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. This is called ''implantation bleeding''. It frequently occurs when the next ''menstrual period'' is expected. Signs of implantation bleeding are light bleeding or spotting around the time of the expected menstrual period. This does not happen in every pregnancy.'  
What causes bleeding during pregnancy (second and third trimesters)?,"'Bleeding or spotting later in pregnancy can be due to a number of causes. Sometimes, having sex or even having an internal (pelvic) examination by your OB/GYN or ''midwife'' can cause light bleeding during pregnancy. Problems with the cervix, including cervical insufficiency (when the cervix opens too early in pregnancy) or infection of the cervix, can lead to bleeding. More serious causes of bleeding in later pregnancy include ''placenta previa'', preterm ''labor'', uterine rupture, or ''placental abruption''.' "
When should you call your doctor if you have heavy bleeding during pregnancy?,"'Any time you notice bleeding during any stage of pregnancy, it is appropriate to call your doctor. It is particularly important to seek medical attention if the bleeding is heavy (like a menstrual period) or accompanied by ''pain'' or cramping.' "
Labor and Delivery: Pain control options introduction,"'Women respond differently to the ''pain'' of ''labor and delivery''. ''Pain'' control options during ''labor'"" and delivery are a personal choice, and a birth plan can typically be individualized according to a woman's wishes. The circumstances of ""'labor'' and individual medical conditions can sometimes determine what pain relief options are indicated. Available medical pain control options range from pain control medications to ''nerve blocks'' and anesthesia. It is helpful to discuss your preferences with your health care professional in advance so that your questions can be fully answered and your wishes can be expressed. Of course, during your ''labor'"", your health care professional will assess your progress and determine how you are feeling. It's fine to change your mind about pain relief options even during ""'labor''. Consequently, understanding the various options for pain control will help you make an informed decision.''This article describes the most commonly used medical pain relief interventions used for labor and delivery. All of these options have been shown to be safe for both mother and baby.' "
Regional anesthesia: Spinal and epidural blocks,"'Epidural anesthesia is a popular choice for pain control because it does not affect your ability to push during labor. With this procedure, medications are injected near the nerves of the low back to block pain signals from your lower body, even though you remain awake and labor is usually not significantly slowed. An anesthesiologist typically administers this type of anesthesia. With an epidural block, the medicine is injected into the sac that surrounds the spinal cord. Before the medications are injected, a numbing medication is given into the lower back. An epidural block can be used for a Cesarean delivery.''With a spinal block, both contractions and the ability to push are temporarily abolished. With a spinal block, the anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space surrounding the spinal cord. A spinal block is usually used when a Cesarean section or an instrumented delivery (e.g. forceps or vacuum extraction) is planned. A spinal usually provides better pain relief than an epidural and may take several hours to wear off, at which time sensory and motor function of the tissues/muscles controlled by the previously blocked nerves will return.''Because many women are not able to urinate immediately following regional anesthesia, a catheter may need to be inserted into the bladder until the spinal or epidural block wears off. A relatively uncommon complication is a ''headache'' which begins after the anesthesia wears off. Both types of anesthesia may temporarily reduce ''blood pressure'', although this is more commonly seen with a spinal block.''A spinal block requires less medication and is typically given only one time, while, with an epidural block, a catheter may be inserted into the epidural space for repeated delivery of anesthetic medications as necessary.''An epidural block takes about 10 to 20 minutes to work, and because a catheter is inserted into the epidural space, the effects can last as long as needed due to the ability to inject more medication. A spinal block begins working immediately, but its effects last only about 2 ½ hours. It is possible to have a combination of both spinal and epidural anesthesia.' "
Local anesthesia,"'Local injections of a numbing medication may be used to relieve a small area of pain, typically around the vagina, if you require an ''episiotomy'' to extend the vaginal opening or if ''stitches'' are needed to repair any damage. This type of anesthesia cannot be used to relieve the pain from contractions during labor.' "
Pudendal block,'A pudendal block is another type of local anesthesia. It involves injecting a numbing medication into the wall of the vagina shortly before delivery to block pain signals from the vagina and area around the vaginal opening. It usually works within 10 minutes and lasts for up to an hour. It does not relieve the pain of labor and is only used at the time of delivery.' 
Narcotics,"'Narcotics, or opioids, are ''drugs'' that diminish the perception of pain. They may be given intravenously or as an intramuscular injection during labor. They can cause ''nausea'' or sleepiness, and they do not completely eliminate pain. Although narcotics have been shown to be safe in labor, they may cause a temporary ''depression'' of ''respiration'' in both mother and baby.'  "
Nitrous oxide,"'Nitrous oxide is an odorless, tasteless, inhaled ''gas'' that is given using a hand-held face mask. It is not generally used in labor in the US but is sometimes used in the United Kingdom and Canada. It has little effect on the baby. Nitrous oxide does not eliminate pain but changes the way the pain is perceived.' "
What is placenta previa?,"'Placenta previa is the most common cause of painless bleeding in the later ''stages of pregnancy'' (after the 20th week). The placenta is a temporary organ that joins the mother and fetus and transfers oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus. The placenta is disk-shaped and at full term measures about seven inches in diameter. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus (womb). Placenta previa is a complication that results from the placenta implanting either near to, or overlying, the outlet of the uterus (the opening of the uterus, the cervix).''Because the placenta is rich in blood vessels, if it is implanted near the outlet of the uterus, bleeding can occur when the cervix dilates or stretches.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of placenta previa?,"'Bleeding is the primary symptom of placenta previa and occurs in the majority (70%-80%) of women with this condition.'   Vaginal bleeding after the 20th week of gestation is characteristic of placenta previa. Usually the bleeding is painless, but it can be associated with uterine contractions and abdominal pain. Bleeding may range in severity from light to severe."
What are the types of placenta previa?,"'The types of placenta previa include:''The term low-lying placenta or low placenta has been used to refer both to placenta previa and marginal placenta previa. Sometimes, the terms anterior placenta previa and posterior placenta previa are used to further define the exact position of the placenta within the uterus, as defined by ultrasound examinations.' Complete placenta previa occurs when the placenta completely covers the opening from the womb to the cervix. Partial placenta previa occurs when the placenta partially covers the cervical opening Marginal placenta previa occurs when the placenta is located adjacent to, but not covering, the cervical opening."
What causes placenta previa?,"""The placenta may be located in the lower part of the uterus either covering or adjacent to the cervical outlet for a number of reasons. The placenta normally migrates away from the cervical opening as the pregnancy progresses, so women in the earlier stages of pregnancy are more likely to have placenta previa than are women at term. Although up to 6% of women between 10 and 20 weeks' gestation will have some evidence of placenta previa on ultrasound examination, 90% of these cases resolve on their own as the pregnancy progresses.""'Placenta previa that persists beyond the 20th week of gestation can be due to abnormalities of the uterus that promote attachment of the placenta in the lower regions of the uterus or to factors that require an increased size of the placenta.' "
Uterine factors,"'Uterine factors that can predispose to placenta previa include scarring of the upper lining tissues of the uterus. This can occur because of prior Cesarean deliveries, prior instrumentation (such as D&C procedures for miscarriages or induced abortions) of the uterine ''cavity'', or any type of surgery involving the uterus.' "
Placental factors,"'When the placenta must grow larger to compensate for decreased function (lowered ability to deliver oxygen and/or nutrients), there is an increased chance of developing placenta previa since the surface area of the placenta will be larger. Examples of situations in which there is need for greater placenta function, and a resultant increase in risk for placenta previa include;' multiple gestation, cigarette smoking in the mother, and living at high altitude."
How many pregnant women have placenta previa? Who is at risk?,"'Placenta previa is found in approximately four out of every 1000 ''pregnancies'' beyond the 20th week of gestation. Asian women are at a slightly greater risk for placenta previa than are women of other ethnic groups, although the reason for this is unclear. It has also been observed that women carrying male fetuses are at slightly greater risk for placenta previa than are women carrying female fetuses.''The risk of having placenta previa increases with increasing maternal age and with the number of previous deliveries. Women who have had placenta previa in one pregnancy also have a greater risk for having placenta previa in subsequent pregnancies.' "
How is placenta previa diagnosed?,"'An ultrasound examination is used to establish the diagnosis of placenta previa. Either a transabdominal (using a probe on the abdominal wall) or transvaginal (with a probe inserted inside the vagina but away from the cervical opening) ultrasound evaluation may be performed, depending upon the location of the placenta. Sometimes both types of ultrasound examination are necessary.''It is important that the ultrasound examination be performed before a physical examination of the pelvis in women with suspected placenta previa, since the pelvic physical examination may lead to further bleeding.'  "
What is the treatment and management for placenta previa?,"'Treatment of placenta previa depends upon the;''Cesarean delivery (''C-section'') is required for complete placenta previa '""and may be necessary for other types of placenta previa. A Cesarean delivery is usually planned for women with placenta previa as soon as the baby can be safely delivered (typically after 36 weeks' gestation), although an emergency Cesarean delivery at any earlier gestational age may be necessary for heavy bleeding that cannot be stopped after treatment in the hospital (see below).""'Women who are actively bleeding or who have bleeding that cannot be stopped will be admitted to the hospital for further care. If there has been little or no bleeding or the bleeding has stopped, bed rest at home may be prescribed. Home care is not always appropriate, and women who remain at home must be able to access medical care immediately should bleeding resume. Women with placenta previa in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy are advised to avoid sexual intercourse and ''exercise'' and to reduce their activity level.''Women with placenta previa who experience heavy bleeding may require blood transfusions and intravenous fluids. In some cases, tocolytic ''drugs'' (medications that slow down or inhibit ''labor''), such as magnesium sulfate or ''terbutaline'' (Brethine) are necessary. ''Corticosteroids'' may be given to enhance lung development in the fetus prior to Cesarean delivery.'   extent and severity of bleeding, gestational age and condition of the fetus, position of the placenta and fetus, and whether the bleeding has stopped."
What are complications of placenta previa? Is it harmful to the fetus and baby?," Placenta previa can be associated with other abnormalities of the placenta or of the umbilical cord. Some studies have shown a reduction in fetal growth associated with placenta previa, and the presence of the placenta in the lower part of the uterus makes breech or abnormal presentation of the fetus more likely. The bleeding of placenta previa can increase the risk for preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), leading to premature labor. Placenta accreta is a serious complication that occurs in 5% to 10% of women with placenta previa. Placenta accreta results when the placental tissue grows too deeply into the womb, attaching to the muscle layer, resulting in difficulty separating the placenta from the wall of the uterus at delivery. This complication can cause life-threatening bleeding and commonly requires hysterectomy at the time of Cesarean delivery. As with other complications of pregnancy, placenta previa can have a significant emotional impact on the pregnant woman."
What is the prognosis for a woman with placenta previa during her pregnancy?,"'The majority of women with placenta previa in developed countries will deliver healthy babies, and the maternal mortality (death) rate is less than 1%. In developing countries where medical resources may be lacking, the risks for mother and fetus may be higher.'  "
How can you prevent placenta previa during pregnancy?,"'Placenta previa cannot typically be prevented. In some cases, risk factors for the development of placenta previa can be eliminated (such as ''smoking cessation'').' "
What are preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia is a condition that can develop during pregnancy characterized by ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') and protein in the urine (proteinuria). If not properly recognized and managed, preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia, which is defined as the development of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. Eclampsia is serious for both mother and baby and can even be fatal. Preeclampsia was formerly known as toxemia of pregnancy. Without treatment, it has been estimated that 1 out of 200 cases of preeclampsia will progress to seizures (eclampsia). Estimates of the incidence of preeclampsia range from 2% to 7% in healthy women who have never before given birth.''Preeclampsia occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and can occur during the days following birth. Some reports describe preeclampsia as occurring up to 4 to 6 weeks after birth, although most cases of postpartum preeclampsia occur within 48 hours of delivery. A mahority of cases occur after the 34th week of gestation, and 6% occur after birth.''Preeclampsia and eclampsia are most common in first-time ''pregnancies''. Pregnant teens and women over 40 are also at increased risk.' "
What causes preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'The exact cause of preeclampsia and eclampsia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a disorder of the lining of blood vessels. Abnormalities of the placenta have also been described. It likely arises due to a combination of factors, including both genetic and environmental influences. A number of genes have been studied as being potentially involved in preeclampsia, and there is an increased risk for women with affected family members. Nutritional factors, ''obesity'', and the immune system may also play a role in its development although this is not yet fully understood. Some studies of the immune response in preeclampsia have shown problems in the way certain cells of the immune system interact with each other to regulate the immune response.'  "
Who is at risk for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"""Different factors can increase a woman's risk for developing preeclampsia and eclampsia. These include:"" Age: Teens or women over 40 are at 
greatest risk History of preeclampsia/eclampsia in a 
previous pregnancy Obesity Having had high blood pressure prior to 
pregnancy Pregnancy achieved through egg donation 
or donor insemination Having a mother or sister who had 
preeclampsia Having certain diseases, like diabetes, 
 lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or some kidney diseases Multiple gestation Sickle cell disease"
What are the symptoms of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Most women with mild preeclampsia do not have any symptoms.''Other symptoms and signs that can occur with severe preeclampsia include\xa0''Symptoms of eclampsia include those of preeclampsia along with the development of seizures. When seizures occur, they are most often preceded by neurological symptoms like ''headache'' and vision disturbances. Women with severe preeclampsia may have a reduced ''platelet count'' (below 100,000).''Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia go away within 1 to 6 weeks after delivery of the baby.'   The hallmark signs, as mentioned previously, are the presence of protein in the urine and elevated blood pressure. Swelling of the feet, legs, and hands is also common, but this can occur in normal pregnancy and is not necessarily related to preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia may experience sudden weight gain over 1 to 2 days. dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, vision changes, changes in reflexes, altered mental state, fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and a decrease in urine output."
How are preeclampsia and eclampsia diagnosed?,"'Preeclampsia may be diagnosed at a regular pregnancy health screening.''Recent research has shown that Congo red (CR) ''spotting'' tests may be better indicators of preeclampsia than standard urine dipstick tests for proteinuria. The test is based on the fact that the urine and placentas of women with preeclampsia contain abnormally folded proteins that bind to the Congo red stain. Since preeclampsia may be asymptomatic (produce no symptoms), it is important for pregnant women to have routine health checkups. Tests to monitor the health of mother and baby will also be ordered.''There are no predictive tests to show whether or not a woman will develop preeclampsia.' Protein in the urine is diagnosed by urinalysis, and blood pressure measurements taken in the clinic may show elevated values. Blood pressure in preeclampsia is usually over 140/90. Blood tests, such as blood cell counts and tests for blood clotting ability, can also be done."
What is the treatment for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'There is no cure for preeclampsia and eclampsia other than delivery of the baby. The decision about whether to induce ''labor'' or perform a Cesarean section depends upon the severity of the condition, as well as the gestational age and health of the fetus.'""Women with mild preeclampsia are often induced at 37 weeks' gestation. Prior to this time, they can be managed at home or in the hospital with close monitoring. During this time steroid ""'drugs'"" may be given to promote maturation of the baby's lungs. Women with mild preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks' gestation are often placed on bed rest with frequent medical monitoring.""'In severe preeclampsia, delivery (induction of ''labor'' or Cesarean delivery [''C-section'']) is usually considered after 34 weeks of gestation. The risks to the mother and baby from the disease must be balanced against the risk of prematurity in each case. Intravenous magnesium sulfate can be given to women with severe preeclampsia to prevent seizures. This medication is safe for the baby. Oral ''supplements'' containing magnesium are not effective in preventing seizures and are not recommended. Medications such as ''hydralazine'' to lower blood pressure may also be given.''Eclampsia is a medical emergency. It is treated with medications to control seizures and maintain a stable blood pressure with the goal of minimizing complications for both mother and baby. Magnesium sulfate is used as a first-line treatment when eclamptic seizures do occur. If the seizures are not controlled by magnesium sulfate, other medications such as ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'', ''Dilantin-125'') can be administered.' "
What are complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia reduces the amount of blood flow to the placenta and the fetus. Therefore, the baby may have delayed growth and low birth weight. Preterm delivery is also more common. Oligohydramnios, a decrease in the volume of ''amniotic fluid'',\xa0is a frequent accompaniment of preeclampsia.''Severe preeclampsia can affect liver and kidney function. HELLP syndrome,\xa0''hemolysis'' (destruction of ''red blood cells''), elevated ''liver enzymes'', and low platelets, is a rare complication of preeclampsia. Symptoms include ''headache'', ''nausea'',\xa0''vomiting'', and right upper quadrant\xa0''abdominal pain''. In some cases, HELLP syndrome develops before the typical signs of preeclampsia are apparent.''Other uncommon complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia include decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in a ''stroke''.' Preeclampsia increases the risk of placental abruption, or separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. When this is severe, life-threatening bleeding and fetal death can occur."
Can preeclampsia and eclampsia be prevented?,"'There is no way known to prevent preeclampsia and eclampsia. However, the outcome can be improved with prompt recognition and management, so it is important for pregnant women to have routine health screenings.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,'Most women with mild preeclampsia have good pregnancy outcomes. Eclampsia is a serious condition with about a 2% mortality (death) rate.''The recurrence risk for preeclampsia varies according to the onset and severity of the condition.''Women with preeclampsia may be at increased risk for ''cardiovascular disease'' later in life. This risk is greatest in women with early onset of severe preeclampsia. Research is ongoing to further clarify this potential risk.' Women with severe preeclampsia who had an onset of the condition early in pregnancy have the highest recurrence risk. Studies show recurrence rates of 25% to 65% for this population. Only 5% to 7% of women with mild preeclampsia will have preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy.
Prenatal care and tests introduction,"'Medical checkups and screening tests help keep you and your baby healthy during pregnancy. This is called prenatal care. It also involves education and counseling about how to handle different aspects of your pregnancy. During your visits, your doctor may discuss many issues, such as healthy eating and physical activity, screening tests you might need, and what to expect during ''labor and delivery''.' "
Choosing a prenatal care provider,"'You will see your prenatal care provider many times before you have your baby. So you want to be sure that the person you choose has a good reputation, and listens to and respects you. You will want to find out if the doctor or ''midwife'' can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth, such as a specific hospital or birthing center. Your provider also should be willing and able to give you the information and support you need to make an informed choice about whether to breastfeed or bottle-feed.''Health care providers that care for women during pregnancy include:''Check with your health insurance company to find out if they will cover the cost of a doula. When choosing a doula, find out if she is certified by Doulas of North America (DONA) or another professional group.''Ask your primary care doctor, friends, and family members for provider recommendations. When making your choice, think about:' Obstetricians (OB) are medical doctors who specialize in the care of pregnant women and in delivering babies. OBs also have special training in surgery so they are also able to do acesarean delivery. Women who have health problems or are at risk for pregnancy complications should see an obstetrician. Women with the highest risk pregnancies might need special care from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
 Family practice doctors are medical doctors who provide care for the whole family through all stages of life. This includes care during pregnancy and delivery, and following birth. Most family practice doctors cannot perform cesarean deliveries. A certified nurse-midwife (CNM) and certified professional midwife (CPM) are trained to provide pregnancy and postpartum care. Midwives can be a good option for healthy women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. A CNM is educated in both nursing and midwifery. Most CNMs practice in hospitals and birth centers. A CPM is required to have experience delivering babies in home settings because most CPMs practice in homes and birthing centers. All midwives should have a back-up plan with an obstetrician in case of a problem or emergency. A doula (DOO-luh) is a professional labor coach, who gives physical and emotional support to women during labor and delivery. They offer advice on breathing, relaxation, movement, and positioning. Doulas also give emotional support and comfort to women and their partners during labor and birth. Doulas and midwives often work together during a woman's labor. A recent study showed that continuous doula support during labor was linked to shorter labors and much lower use of:

Places to deliver your baby,"""Many women have strong views about where and how they'd like to deliver their babies. In general, women can choose to deliver at a hospital, birth center, or at home. You will need to contact your health insurance provider to find out what options are available. Also, find out if the doctor or midwife you are considering can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth.""'Hospitals'' are a good choice for women with health problems, pregnancy complications, or those who are at risk for problems during labor and delivery. Hospitals offer the most advanced medical equipment and highly trained doctors for ''pregnant'' women and their babies. In a hospital, doctors can do a cesarean delivery if you or your baby is in danger during labor. Women can get epidurals or many other ''pain'' relief options. Also, more and more hospitals now offer on-site birth centers, which aim to offer a style of care similar to standalone birth centers.''Questions to ask when choosing a hospital:''Birth or birthing centers'' give women a ""homey"" environment in which to labor and give birth. They try to make labor and delivery a natural and personal process by doing away with most high-tech equipment and routine procedures. So, you will not automatically be hooked up to an IV. Likewise, you won\'t have an electronic fetal monitor around your belly the whole time. Instead, the midwife or nurse will check in on your baby from time to time with a handheld machine. Once the baby is born, all exams and care will occur in your room. Usually certified nurse-midwives, not obstetricians, deliver babies at birth centers. Healthy women who are at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery may choose to deliver at a birth center.''Women cannot receive epidurals at a birth center, although some ''pain'' medicines may be available. If a cesarean delivery becomes necessary, women must be moved to a hospital for the procedure. After delivery, babies with problems can receive basic emergency care while being moved to a hospital.''Many birthing centers have showers or tubs in their rooms for laboring women. They also tend to have comforts of home like large beds and rocking chairs. In general, birth centers allow more people in the delivery room than do hospitals. ''Birth centers can be inside of hospitals, a part of a hospital or completely separate facilities. If you want to deliver at a birth center, make sure it meets the standards of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission, or the American Association of Birth Centers. Accredited birth centers must have doctors who can work at a nearby hospital in case of problems with the mom or baby. Also, make sure the birth center has the staff and set-up to support.''Homebirth'"" is an option for healthy pregnant women with no risk factors for complications during pregnancy, labor or delivery. It is also important women have a strong after-care support system at home. Some certified nurse midwives and doctors will deliver babies at home. Many health insurance companies do not cover the cost of care for homebirths. So check with your plan if you'd like to deliver at home.""""Homebirths are common in many countries in Europe. However, in the United States, planned homebirths are not supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG states that hospitals are the safest place to deliver a baby. In case of an emergency, says ACOG, a hospital's equipment and highly trained doctors can provide the best care for a woman and her baby.""'If you are thinking about a homebirth, you need to weigh the pros and cons. The main advantage is that you will be able to experience labor and delivery in the privacy and comfort of your own home. Since there will be no routine medical procedures, you will have control of your experience.''The main disadvantage of a homebirth is that in case of a problem, you and the baby will not have immediate hospital/medical care. It will have to wait until you are transferred to the hospital. Plus, women who deliver at home have no options for pain relief. ''To ensure your safety and that of your baby, you must have a highly trained and experienced midwife along with a fail-safe back-up plan. You will need fast, reliable transportation to a hospital. If you live far away from a hospital, homebirth may not be the best choice. Your midwife must be experienced and have the necessary skills and supplies to start emergency care for you and your baby if need be. Your midwife should also have access to a doctor 24 hours a day.' Is it close to your home?  Is a doctor who can give pain relief, such as an epidural, at the hospital 24-hours a day? 
	 Do you like the feel of the labor and delivery rooms?  Are private rooms available?  How many support people can you invite into the room with you?  Does it have a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in case of serious problems with the baby?
	 Can the baby stay in the room with you?  Does the hospital have the staff and set-up to support successful 
	breastfeeding?

Prenatal checkups,"'During pregnancy, regular checkups are very important. This consistent care can help keep you and your baby healthy, spot problems if they occur, and prevent problems during delivery. Typically, routine checkups occur:''Women with high-risk pregnancies need to see their doctors more often.''At your first visit your doctor will perform a full physical exam, take your blood for lab tests, and calculate your due date. Your doctor might also do a breast exam, a ''pelvic exam'' to check your uterus (womb), and a cervical exam, including a ''Pap test'"". During this first visit, your doctor will ask you lots of questions about your lifestyle, relationships, and health habits. It's important to be honest with your doctor.""'After the first visit, most prenatal visits will include:''You also will have some routine tests throughout your pregnancy, such as tests to look foranemia, tests to measure risk of gestational ''diabetes'', and tests to look for harmful infections.''Become a partner with your doctor to manage your care.

Monitor your baby's activity,"'After 28 weeks, keep track of your baby\'s movement. This will help you to notice if your baby is moving less than normal, which could be a sign that your baby is in distress and needs a doctor\'s care. An easy way to do this is the ""count-to-10"" approach. Count your baby\'s movements in the evening — the time of day when the fetus tends to be most active. Lie down if you have trouble feeling your baby move. Most women count 10 movements within about one hour. It is rare for a woman to count less than 10 movements within two hours at times when the baby is active. Count your baby\'s movements every day so you know what is normal for you. Call your doctor if you count less than 10 movements within two hours or if you notice your baby is moving less than normal. If your baby is not moving at all, call your doctor right away.' "
Prenatal tests,"""Tests are used during pregnancy to check your and your baby's health. At your fist prenatal visit, your doctor will use tests to check for a number of things, such as:""'Throughout your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife may suggest a number of other tests, too. Some tests are suggested for all women, such as screenings for gestational ''diabetes'', ''Down syndrome'', and ''HIV''. Other tests might be offered based on your:''Some tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of ''possible'' health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results, your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. ''The following chart describes some of the most common prenatal tests:'""If your doctor suggests certain prenatal tests, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. Learning about the test, why your doctor is suggesting it for you, and what the test results could mean can help you cope with any worries or fears you might have. Keep in mind that screening tests do not diagnose problems. They evaluate risk. So if a screening test comes back abnormal, this doesn't mean there is a problem with your baby.

High-risk pregnancy,"'Pregnancies with a greater chance of complications are called ""high-risk."" But this doesn\'t mean there will be problems. The following factors may increase the risk of problems during pregnancy:''Health problems also may develop during a pregnancy that make it high-risk, such as ''gestational diabetes'' or ''preeclampsia''.''Women with high-risk pregnancies need prenatal care more often and sometimes from a specially trained doctor. A maternal-fetal medicine specialist is a medical doctor that cares for high-risk pregnancies.'""If your pregnancy is considered high risk, you might worry about your unborn baby's health and have trouble enjoying your pregnancy. Share your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor can explain your risks and the chances of a real problem. Also, be sure to follow your doctor's advice.

What should you know about quad marker screening?,"'The quad marker screening test (quad screen) is a blood test administered in ''pregnancy'', typically between the 15th and 20th weeks of gestation. Similar to the triple screen, the quad marker screen provides information about whether there is an increased risk for certain ''birth defects'' in the baby.''The test is simple and involves taking a blood sample as for any other routine blood test. The quad marker test is a screening test, meaning that it gives information about risk, but it does not allow the definitive diagnosis of any conditions. It can only signal that further testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis. There is no risk to the baby from the test.'  "
Why did my doctor order a quad marker screening test?,"'The quad screen looks at the three substances also measured in the triple screen (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol) test plus one additional substance, inhibin A.'""Looking at levels of these four substances in the mother's bloodstream allows an estimation of risk for ""'neural tube defects'' and certain chromosomal abnormalities, like ''Down syndrome''.' Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the liver of the fetus Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone made by the placenta Estriol is an estrogen made both by the placenta and the liver of the fetus Inhibin-A is another hormone made by the placenta"
How accurate is the quad marker screening test?,"""The test is a screening test only, and is not 100% accurate. It can predict about 85% of open neural tube defects, problems with the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. It predicts about 80% of fetuses with ""'Down syndrome'' in women over age 35 and about 75% \xa0in younger women. The fact that it is not 100% accurate means that not all women who have a positive high risk result on the quad screen will have a fetus with a birth defect, and the test may also be normal even in the presence of birth defects.''For example, about 50 women out of every 1,000 will have a result on the quad screen that indicates an increased risk of a birth defect, but only one to two of those women will actually have a baby with an open neural tube defect. About 40 women out of 1,000 will have a result indicating an increased risk of Down syndrome, but only one to two of these women will have a baby with Down syndrome.' "
What should you do if you have normal or abnormal tests results?,"""As with any screening test, an abnormal result does not mean that the fetus definitely has a birth defect or genetic condition. It only means that the blood levels of these four substances suggest that a woman's risk is increased of having a baby with certain conditions. Women who have a result suggesting increased risk are typically offered further testing. This can include repeating the quad screen and/or having a high definition ""'ultrasound'' examination to look for signs of birth defects or abnormalities in the developing baby. If this testing is abnormal, the mother may be offered the choice to undergo ''amniocentesis''. Amniocentesis involves withdrawing a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' for genetic and chromosome testing, and it can definitively establish the diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal problems in most fetuses. Amniocentesis carries a small risk of ''miscarriage'' (fewer than 1% of fetuses tested).' "

How is 2009 H1N1 flu treated?," 2009 H1N1 flu is treated with antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu® (oseltamivir) 
or Relenza® (zanamivir). Antiviral drugs are prescription pills, liquids or an 
inhaled powder that fight against the flu by keeping the germs from growing in 
your body. These medicines work best if they are taken as soon as you have 
symptoms of the flu. For that reason, it is important that you call your doctor 
as soon as you notice flu-like symptoms.  If your doctor prescribes an antiviral to treat your flu, you will need to 
take it for 5 days. The medicine can make you get better faster and make your 
symptoms milder.  At this time, there have been no reports to show harm to the pregnant woman 
or her unborn baby. Flu can cause serious illness and even death in pregnant 
women. Taking antiviral medicine can help prevent these severe outcomes.  Antiviral medicines can be taken at any stage during pregnancy.  Treat any fever right away. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is best for a pregnant

Why does CDC advise pregnant women to receive the 2009 H1N1 influenza (flu) vaccine (shot)?,"'Getting the flu shot is the single best way to protect against the flu. It is important for a pregnant woman to receive both the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and the seasonal flu shot. A pregnant woman who gets any type of flu has a greater chance for serious health problems. Compared with people in general who get 2009 H1N1 flu (formerly called ""''swine flu''""), pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 flu are more likely to be admitted to hospitals. Pregnant women are also more likely to have serious illness and death from 2009 H1N1 flu. When a pregnant woman gets a flu shot, it can protect both her and her baby. Research has found that pregnant women who had a flu shot get sick less often with the flu than do pregnant women who did not get a flu shot. Babies born to mothers who had a flu shot in pregnancy also get sick with flu less often than do babies whose mothers did not get a flu shot. ' "
Will the seasonal flu shot also protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu?,"'Seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 flu are caused by different viruses. The seasonal ''flu vaccine'' will not protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine will not protect against seasonal flu. ' "
Are there flu vaccines that pregnant women should not get?,"'The seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines can be given by shot or by nasal spray. Pregnant women should get the ""flu shot"" - a vaccine made with killed flu virus. This one is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The other type of flu vaccine - a nasal spray - is not approved for pregnant women. This vaccine is made with live, weakened flu virus. Nasal spray flu vaccine should be used only in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. The nasal spray vaccine is safe for women after they have delivered, even if they are ''nursing''.' "
"Can the seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot be given at the same 
time?","'Seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu shots can be given on the same day but should be given at different sites (e.g., one shot in the left arm and the other shot in the right arm). If a woman is getting her vaccines after delivery, she can get the nasal spray flu vaccine. However, she should not get the seasonal and 2009 H1N1 nasal spays on the same day; they should be given 4 weeks apart.' "
Is the 2009 H1N1 flu shot safe for pregnant women?,"'The seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine is being made in the same way and at the same places where the seasonal flu vaccine is made. ''Studies to test the 2009 H1N1 flu shots in healthy children and adults and pregnant women are being done now. Results are available from some of the studies done in non-pregnant adults and children. These results show that the immune system responded well to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and the safety results were very similar to those seen in studies of seasonal flu vaccine. These studies are being conducted by the National Institute of ''Allergy'' and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the vaccine manufacturers. ''There is no evidence that thimerosal (a mercury preservative in vaccine that comes in multi-dose vials) is harmful to a pregnant woman or a fetus. However, because some women are concerned about thimerosal during pregnancy, vaccine companies are making preservative-free seasonal flu vaccine and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine in single-dose syringes for pregnant women and small children. CDC advises pregnant women to get flu shots either with or without thimerosal. ''Adjuvants are agents that are sometimes added to a vaccine to make it more effective. There are no adjuvants (such as squalene) in either the 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu shot used in the United States. ''Both seasonal flu shots and 2009 H1N1 flu shots are recommended for pregnant women at any time during pregnancy.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of one shot for full protection for persons 10 years and older. Therefore, a pregnant woman is recommended to get one dose of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. ''A pregnant woman who had a flu-like illness at any time in the past should still get the 2009 H1N1 shot because she cannot assume that the illness she had was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. Pregnant women who had flu symptoms in the past do not need to be tested now, but should get the vaccine. ' "
What are the possible side effects of the 2009 H1N1 flu shots?,"'The side effects from 2009 H1N1 flu shots are expected to be like those from seasonal flu shots. The most common side effects after flu shots are mild, such as being sore and tender and/or red and swollen where the shot was given. Some people might have ''headache'', muscle aches, fever, and ''nausea'' or feel tired. If these problems happen, they usually begin soon after the shot and may last as long as 1-2 days. Some people may faint after getting any shot. Sometimes, flu shots can cause serious problems like severe ''allergic'' reactions. But, life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. A person who has a severe (life-threatening) ''allergy'' to eggs or to anything else in the vaccine should not get the shot, even if she is pregnant. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have any severe ''allergies'' or if they have ever had a ''severe allergic reaction'' following a flu shot.''In 1976, an earlier type of swine flu vaccine was associated with cases of a severe paralytic illness called ''Guillain-Barre Syndrome'' (GBS) at a rate of approximately 1 case of GBS per 100,000 persons vaccinated. Some studies done since 1976 have shown a small risk of GBS in persons who received the seasonal ''influenza'' vaccine. This risk is estimated to be no more than 1 case of GBS per 1 million persons vaccinated. Other studies have shown no increase in risk of GBS. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have ever had GBS.' "
What about the H1N1 nasal spray vaccine?,"'Pregnant women should not receive nasal spray for the seasonal or 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine, but it is okay for a pregnant woman to be around a family member or another close contact who has received nasal spray flu vaccine. The nasal spray vaccine can be used in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant and in women after they deliver, even if they are nursing. ''Yes. No special precautions are needed. Nurses and doctors should wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub before and after giving the vaccine.''The nasal spray flu vaccine has not been approved for pregnant women. It differs from the flu shot because it is made with live, weakened virus. However, sometimes a pregnant woman might get the nasal spray flu vaccine—for example, before she knew she was pregnant. If this happened, she would not be expected to have any additional problems. The weakened, live flu virus has never been shown to be passed to the unborn baby. However, if a woman does get the nasal spray vaccine while she is pregnant, she should talk to her healthcare provider.''Yes. Besides protecting her from infection, the shot may also help protect her infant. Flu shots are only given to infants 6 months of age and older. Everyone who lives with or gives care to an infant less than 6 months of age should get both the seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 vaccines. A woman can get either the shots or the nasal spray after she delivers. ' "
What about breastfeeding and the H1N1 influenza and vaccination safety?,"""Yes. Both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines should be given to breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding women can receive either the shot or the nasal spray form of the vaccine. Breastfeeding is fully compatible with flu vaccination, and preventing the flu in mothers can reduce the chance that the infant will get the flu. Also, by breastfeeding, mothers can pass on to the infant the antibodies that their bodies make in response to the flu shots, which can reduce the infant's chances of getting sick with the flu. This is especially important for infants less than 6 months old, who have no other way of receiving vaccine antibodies, since they are too young to be vaccinated.""""Take everyday precautions such as washing your hands with plain soap and water before feeding your baby. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub to clean your hands before feeding your baby. In addition, try not to cough or sneeze in the baby's face while feeding your baby, or any other time you and your baby are close. If possible, only family members who are not sick should care for infants. If you are sick and there is no one else to care for your baby, wear a facemask, if available and tolerable, and cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when ""'coughing'' or ''sneezing''. ''Infants are thought to be at higher risk for severe illness from 2009 H1N1 infection and very little is known about ''prevention'' of 2009 H1N1 flu infection in infants. If you are breastfeeding or giving your baby ''infant formula'', a cautious approach would be to protect your baby from exposure to the flu virus in the following ways:'""There are many ways that breastfeeding and breast milk protect babies' health. Flu can be very serious in young babies. Babies who are not breastfed get sick from infections like the flu more often and more severely than babies who are breastfed.""""Since this is a new virus, we don't know yet about specific protection against it. Mothers pass on protective antibodies to their baby during breastfeeding. Antibodies are a type of protein made by the immune system in the body. Antibodies help fight off infection. ""'If you are sick with flu and are breastfeeding, someone who is not sick can give your baby your expressed milk. ''No. Because mothers make antibodies to fight diseases they come in contact with, their milk is custom-made to fight the diseases their babies are exposed to as well. This is really important in young babies when their immune system is still developing. It is OK to take medicines to prevent the flu while you are breastfeeding. You should make sure you wash your hands often and take everyday precautions. However, if you develop symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or ''sore throat'', you should ask someone who is not sick to care for your baby. If you become sick, someone who is not sick can give your baby your expressed milk.''Yes. Mothers who are breastfeeding and taking medicine to treat flu because they are sick should express their breast milk for bottle feedings, which can be given to your baby by someone who is not sick. Mothers who are breastfeeding and are taking medicines to prevent the flu because they have been exposed to the virus should continue to feed their baby at the breast as long as they do not have symptoms of the flu such as fever, cough, or ''sore throat''.''Yes. One of the best things you can do for your sick baby is keep breastfeeding. ' Ask for help from someone who is not sick to feed and care for your baby, if 
possible.  If there is no one else who can take care of your baby while you are 
	sick, try to wear a face mask at all times when you are feeding or caring 
	for your baby. You should also be very careful about washing your hands and 
	taking everyday precautions to prevent your baby from getting flu. 
Using a cloth blanket between you and your baby during feedings might also help. 
	 If you are breastfeeding, someone who is not sick can give your baby your 
expressed milk. Ideally babies less than about 6 months of age should get their 
feedings from breast milk. It is OK to take medicines to treat the flu while you 
are breastfeeding.  Do not stop breastfeeding if your baby is sick. Give your baby many chances 
to breastfeed throughout the illness. Babies who are sick need more fluids than 
when they are well. The fluid babies get from breast milk is better than 
anything else, even better than water, juice, or Pedialyte® because it also 
helps protect your baby's immune system.  If your baby is too sick to breastfeed, he or she can drink your milk from a 
cup, bottle, syringe, or eye-dropper. "
Is there a pre-pregnancy diet plan?,"'Women who are planning in advance to become ''pregnant'' have a great opportunity to focus on a healthy diet and get into optimum health before conceiving. Many women are encouraged to consider the 3 months before ''conception'' as a ""pre-mester"" or a trimester of pregnancy before conception. Not only does following healthy pregnancy diet plan guideline help a woman get into optimal health, it may help her conceive more easily. The father-to-be also is encouraged to follow a pre-pregnancy diet because it may help the mother-to-be stick to a healthy pregnancy eating plan.' "
What is a healthy pregnancy diet plan?,"""Myths of pregnancy such as '""""you need to eat twice as much because you're eating for two""""' or that indulging your cravings will give your baby ""'birthmarks'' are outdated and inaccurate. From a scientific perspective, there are increased nutrient demands during pregnancy, but the wisdom of the body also tells us pregnancy is a time to focus on nourishment. It is a time for the mother-to-be to focus on being as healthy as she can because that care will translate to her baby in utero. Also, establishing healthy habits now will set a positive example that will benefit the child over his or her lifetime.' The increased caloric needs during pregnancy are minimal; about 300 extra calories are needed each day. This is equivalent to three-quarters of a blueberry muffin or 2 apples or 2 ounces of 
	chocolate milk. 
	 There also are a number of micronutrients or
	vitamins that are needed in increased amounts. The increased requirements are not 
	solely due to the growth of the fetus. The changes in 
the mother's
	metabolism also contribute to the increased nutritional needs. The goal of healthy eating during pregnancy is to maximize micronutrient density. In other worlds, make sure you are getting maximum 
	nutrition out of every bite, and that you avoid ""empty"" calories. 
	 It's also important to know what foods, drinks, medications, and 
	other toxins to avoid, for example, foods that have a higher risk of food-borne illness and foods that are toxic to a developing fetus such as alcohol, mercury-containing fish, and trans
	fats1.  For many women, taking a
	prenatal multivitamin can be ""insurance"" against 
	days when they aren't able to eat much (for example, to make up for lack of 
	nutrition due to morning sickness, or not sticking to a healthy diet one 
	day); however, it is important to remember that

supplement the 
	diet; they aren't replacements for healthy eating."

While every woman is going to be different, research shows that for a normal weight woman (''BMI'' 18.5 – 25), the optimal pregnancy total ''weight gain'' is about 25-35 pounds''7''. Larger women will gain less and smaller women gain more. All women should decrease their focus on weight and focus on the quality of their diet, ensuring good nutrition.''During the first and second ''trimesters'', weight gain manifests as an increase in maternal fat stores, plus a 60% increase in blood volume. Later in pregnancy, more of the weight gain is due to the fetal growth, ''amniotic fluid'', breast development, and placenta. Overweight women sometimes even experience ''weight loss'' during the ''first trimester'' and slowly gain a small amount over the second and third trimesters. There is no minimum amount of weight an overweight woman needs to gain as long as she is eating micronutrient dense foods and fetal growth is on track.'  BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (underweight) - typically gain 28 to 40 lbs. BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (optimal weight) - typically gain 25 to 35 lbs. BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 (overweight) - typically gain 15 to 25 lbs. BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 (obese) - typically gain 11 to 20 lbs."
Is it OK to diet during pregnancy?,"""Regardless of the weight of the woman when she becomes pregnant, it isn't a good idea to diet during pregnancy. Research from famines during World War II in Europe have taught us about the epigenetic implications of restriction during pregnancy. ""'Epigenetics'"" describes the impact of the prenatal environment on the genetic programming of the child that stays with them for life. In fact, the prenatal environment has an impact on the developing ovaries and eggs in the female fetus, having an impact on the next generation too! A mother's nutritional choices during pregnancy can affect her grandchildren!""'During the famines in World War II, pregnant Dutch women lived on less than 900 calories a day for a winter and their metabolism became very efficient at storing energy. When the war ended and food supplies returned to normal, and the ''babies'' were born, the women and their babies had normal calorie intake. However, those babies were far more likely to go on to become obese or develop ''diabetes'' because their genes were influenced during the time of scarcity. In the same way, ''dieting'' during pregnancy can have unintentionally metabolic consequences on the genetic programming of the infant that will stay with them for life.''While ''dieting'' (restricting calories) during pregnancy is discouraged, eating a healthier diet by removing extra ''sugar'' and processed foods is an excellent idea. This is the type of ""diet"" I put all my patients on. The focus should be on high quality nutrition, optimizing micronutrient intake, and minimizing empty calories.' "
Low carb diet menu plans during pregnancy,"'Low carbohydrate diets can be healthy during pregnancy, as they are for any life phase, but the devil is in the details, as they say. More precise than simply a low carb diet, glycemic load diet is beneficial during pregnancy (and throughout life). Glycemic load is a term that measures how quickly a carbohydrate is digested and turned into blood ''sugar''. Carbohydrates with lots of ''fiber'', or combined with fat or protein have lower glycemic loads and raise blood sugar slowly, providing steady energy and preventing a spike in blood sugar and the subsequent ''low blood sugar'' drop. How do you follow a low glycemic load diet? ''Choose carbohydrates in their unrefined (less processed) form:''An easy way to do this is to stay away from ""white"" foods:''White foods are also low in micronutrients. Stay away from processed carbs such as:'

Vegetarian and vegan diet menu plans during pregnancy,"'Pregnant women can absolutely follow vegan or ''vegetarian'' diets during pregnancy. In fact, doing so may help them avoid some of the added hormones that are common in non-organic animal products. However, there are some nutrients that are commonly deficient in vegetarian diets. Pregnant women who are vegan or vegetarian should be extra careful to ensure they are getting enough calcium, iron, and B-12. Protein intake needs to be monitored too. ''Vegetarian protein sources include:''These last three are not part of a vegan pregnancy diet, but are appropriate for a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet.''B-12 is needed for proper DNA expression in the growing embryo and fetus. Deficiencies cause ''anemia'' and are associated with low birth weight, pre-term delivery, ''preeclampsia'', and ''neural tube defects''8''. Pregnant women need 30mcg a day according to the Recommended Daily Allowance, and the sources are all animal-based. Vegan women may want to ensure they get enough by taking a methylcobalamin supplement. Other B ''vitamins'', specifically folate and B6, are important in pregnancy.

Protein needs during pregnancy,"""Protein requirements in pregnancy are increased by 50%. On average, a pregnant woman needs about 70 grams of protein per day. Protein will not only ensure good growth of the baby, it will help keep the mother's blood sugar stable and may help reduce morning sickness. Research studies have shown better birth outcomes (fewer underweight or early babies) when a mother's daily diet is at least 25% protein. Most people think of meat when they think about protein, but there are many excellent vegetarian sources. A vegan or vegetarian pregnancy diet can easily get enough protein from bean, nut, and grain sources.  Additionally, relying only meat sources can increase your intake of saturated fat and other components of meat that are wise to limit in the diet. Here are some examples of good sources of healthy proteins."" 1 egg, 6g 1 c Greek yogurt, 14g 11 c edamame, 29g 2T hummus, 9g 2T almond butter, 8g 1c cooked spinach, 5g 3.5oz chicken breast, 30g 3.5 oz. fish, 22g 1 scoop protein powder, 14g 1 c beans, 18g 1 oz. nuts, 6g 1 c cooked quinoa, 8g"
Iron needs during pregnancy,"'Iron is a common deficiency during pregnancy. Iron is an essential mineral needed to transport oxygen to tissues. It is also necessary for DNA repair and mitochondrial energy production. Insufficient iron can cause ''anemia'' and symptoms of:''Anemia has been linked to pre-term births, low birth weight, and even ''autism'' and increased maternal mortality''10'"". Thus, it's really important to get enough iron during pregnancy. The RDA for iron is 27mg during pregnancy; your obstetrician or ""'midwife'' may recommend 40mg per day to correct a deficiency. Cooking in cast-iron skillets can also increase iron intake – you can add 5mg of additional iron for each per saucy, ''vitamin C''-rich dish you cook in cast iron.''These are some good food sources of iron:' fatigue, pallor, hair loss, poor exercise tolerance, restless legs, and poor cognitive development in children. 3 oz. canned clams, 24mg 1 packet instant oatmeal, 11mg 1 oz.

Folate needs during pregnancy,"'Folate occurs naturally in vegetables and whole grains but it is lost in the processing of refined grains.\xa0 Folate deficiency increases the risk of congenital anomalies, most notably neural tube defects such as ''spina bifida'"". For this reason, it's one of the most serious nutritional deficiencies in pregnancy. Unfortunately, the critical time for neural tube development occurs in the first few weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman knows she's pregnant and thus when she is less likely to be taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid or getting enough in the diet. Because of this, fortification of grain products (adding back in what was lost in processing) was mandated in 1998, and the prevalence of neural tube defects has dropped dramatically. Unfortunately, these foods are fortified with synthetic folic acid, not folate, and a very common genetic variant of the MTHFR gene (that codes for an enzyme important in processing of amino acids), makes it difficult for people to convert folic acid to useable folate and pregnant women with this variant are at particular risk. Researchers have suggested it would be much better to supplement pregnant women, and enrich food, with the active form methyltetrahydrofolate, rather than folic acid""'11''. Fortunately, pregnant women can get the necessary 600mcg of active, natural form folate from these dietary sources:' 1 cup of black-eyed peas, 356mcg 1 cup lentils, 358mcg 1 cup asparagus, 268mcg 1 cup cubed avocado, 122mcg 3 oz. romaine lettuce, 116mcg 1 c broccoli, 55mcg 1c beets, 135mcg 1c papaya, 116mcg"
Calcium needs during pregnancy,"'Calcium is critical for developing bones. It also reduces the risk of pre-''eclampsia'' and ''hypertension''. Women who get enough calcium during pregnancy have a 35% lower risk of ''high blood pressure'' and a 55% lower risk of ''preeclampsia'"". If the mother isn't getting enough additional calcium in the diet, the fetus will still get enough, but it will come from the reserves in the mother's bones. The mother's ability to absorb calcium is greatly increased during pregnancy. This is why the RDA for calcium doesn't increase during pregnancy. However, most adult women don't get enough calcium in the first place.""'When we think about calcium, most people think about milk, but there are numerous non-dairy sources of calcium. Women who are lactose intolerant can choose non-dairy sources. Pregnant women need 1000mg of calcium per day''9''. This can be reached with a few servings per day from the food list below.

In addition to the negative outcomes of low birth weight, early delivery, and preeclampsia that result from deficiency, zinc is important for the immune system of the mother and baby. Iron competes with zinc for absorption, so women who are supplementing with extra iron also need to make sure they are getting extra zinc. Some food sources are:' 4 oz. mushrooms, 11mg 4 oz. beef or lamb, 6mg ¼ c sesame or pumpkin seeds, 3mg 1 cup green peas, 2 mg 3 oz.

Vitamin D needs and pregnancy,"'Pregnant women need 600 IU of vitamin D according to the USDA RDA guidelines; however, many experts believe this estimate is far too low. Humans synthesize vitamin D from sun exposure and there are very few food sources. Additionally, factors such as skin pigmentation, ''obesity'', and ''sunscreen'"" usage impact the ability to make vitamin D from sunlight. In clinical practice, I measure patients' blood levels of vitamin D and find that many are deficient even if they are taking a 2000mcg vitamin D3 supplement every day. Pregnant women who are concerned about vitamin D can consult a midwife, naturopathic midwife, or obstetrician who is willing to test their vitamin D levels so they know how much they need.

"Are supplements, herbs, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications safe to take 
during pregnancy?"," Pregnant women should take a good quality prenatal multivitamin that includes 
natural folate/methylfolate and iron. Most pregnant women may need supplemental vitamin D based on blood tests. Supplements should remain supplemental to a healthy diet and if the diet includes fruits and vegetables at every meal, most nutritional needs should be met. Some supplements and herbs can also be useful to manage some of the 
	symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness. 
	Ginger and vitamin B6 both have been studied and found helpful for 
	nausea in some women14,15. While commonly used, some over the counter medications that have been recommended for 
	nausea, like 
	antihistamines, actually make it worse for some people16. Magnesium is helpful for 
	constipation, and may reduce the risks of developing pre-eclampsia and other poor birth outcomes17. Herbals teas such as raspberry leaf, 
	lemon balm, and chamomile have been traditionally used during pregnancy and are safe to consume, although mint can exacerbate 
	heartburn, so use with care. Women should discuss all of the medications, supplements, and herbs with their midwife or obstetrician."
What foods and exercise help morning sickness and heartburn symptoms?," While bland carbohydrates are commonly recommended for morning sickness and heartburn, studies have actually shown that protein helps more. 
	 Eat a low glycemic-load, healthy pregnancy diet to minimize the risks of feeling poorly. Eat regularly to keep blood sugars stable to minimize nausea. Make sure to consume enough water to stay hydrated and to keep bowels moving regularly. Exercise should be regular and not more vigorous that what the woman was used to before pregnancy. 
	 Long walks, prenatal yoga classes, and stretching are all excellent options for exercise while pregnant. 
	 Research has shown that all types of physical activity are safe in pregnancy except scuba diving, and extra care should be taken to avoid falling. 
	 Other healthy habits to help troublesome pregnancy symptoms include getting outside for fresh air, and ensuring good sleep also make a difference for both the pregnant woman and her baby."
What about a post pregnancy diet?," After delivery, the best diet is one that meets the nutritional needs of breastfeeding and helps the mother gradually return to her pre-pregnancy weight. 
	 Breastfeeding requires about 500 calories per day, so many women lose excess weight quickly. The nutritional needs of breast feeding require extra calcium and protein. 
	 Women also should be prepared for irregular meal patterns as they may be sleeping and awake at odd hours over the first few months as the baby's needs for nursing and sleeping evolve. 
	 New mothers shouldn't be focused on weight loss through calorie restriction while breastfeeding. Instead, they should continue the nutrient-dense diet recommended during pregnancy, and focus on increasing physical activity to accelerate a return to pre-pregnancy weight."
"What foods, drinks, or medicatons should be avoided during pregnancy?","'Pregnant women should stay away from several categories of unsafe foods:''Common bacteria pose a greater risk to pregnant women and their fetus, so extra precautions should be followed.''Some of the man-made food additives are known to cause problems and should be avoided. For example, trans fats cross the maternal/fetal barrier, and are absorbed by fetus and may cause adverse effects on cellular membrane structure.''6'' Although limited research is available to quantify the risks of artificial sweeteners in pregnancy, they are able to cross the placenta into the fetal circulation and are typically found in nutrient-poor, processed foods that should be limited regardless.''Illicit ''drugs'', some ''over-the-counter'' (OTC), and many prescription drugs should also be avoided. If you are having trouble stopping taking illicit drugs or alcohol during pregnancy, talk to your midwife or obstetrician to get help specifically for pregnant women right away. There is help. ''Medications, either OTC or prescription, can be harmful to the fetus; double check with your health-care professional or look up the ""Pregnancy Class"" of the medication before taking it. ' ones that have a higher likelihood of being contaminated with bacteria, ones that are toxic to the fetus, and ones that simply 
	add calories without adding nutrition. Listeria, salmonella and toxoplasmosis are examples of bacterial infections that should be prevented in pregnancy. These infections can increase the risk of miscarriage, damage to fetal brain development and other organs. 
Infections also put the mother at risk with symptoms like diarrhea, dehydration, and fever. To minimize risk, make sure meats are fully cooked and stay away from raw or undercooked meat and seafood. No sushi during pregnancy! Deli meats, meat spreads, and smoked lox are also questionable and should be heated to steaming hot in order to kill any bacteria. Dairy products can also be a source of bacterial contamination. This is why pregnant women are encouraged to stay away from soft unpasteurized cheeses. The important part to remember is that 
pasteurizing (flash heating) foods kills bacteria; for example, pasteurized Brie would be fine. Vegetables and fruit aren't immune to bacterial contamination that occurs during the harvesting or preparation process. Toxoplasma is present in the soil and can contaminate vegetables. Always wash fruits and vegetables before eating them. 
Washing them with a water and white vinegar mixture can be more effective then a 
pure water wash. Alcohol, in any amount, should be avoided. There is no known safe amount of intake, and drinking alcohol puts the fetus at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and associated developmental problems. Caffeine, whether from coffee, soda, or tea, has been associated with decreased birth weight4. Some fish, such as tuna, are high in mercury 
and should be avoided. Mercury is neurotoxic and can impede fetal brain development. Pregnant women should avoid fish that are potentially high in mercury. Some fish are known to be low in mercury (for example, salmon and sardines). In general long lived fish, high on the food chain will contain higher mercury levels. A guide to selecting safe fish can be found at Natural Resources Defense Council's Sustainable Seafood Guide.5 Uncooked/undercooked animal products (like sushi and rare meat), including eggs Unpasteurized dairy products (like soft cheeses) Tuna, lake fish, and other high mercury fish Alcohol Caffeine (in coffee, tea, or soda) Trans fats (anything labeled hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated) Artificial sweeteners Certain drugs"
What is pregnancy planning?,"'Pregnancy planning begins even before conception for many women. Others choose to start planning when they are aware of a pregnancy. While it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby without a pregnancy plan, developing a pregnancy plan is one way to help ensure that your baby has the greatest chances of having good health and that you have a healthy pregnancy. Planning for pregnancy typically involves:' Discussions with a woman's partner and her health-care team, and includes discussions about nutrition and vitamins, exercise, genetic counseling, weight gain, and the need to avoid certain medications and alcohol. Sometimes, planning for pregnancy includes fertility planning and scheduling sexual intercourse for the time of the month when the woman is most fertile. Couples who are having regular sexual intercourse and who still do not conceive typically consult a fertility specialist. Doctors generally recommend that healthy couples in which the woman is under 35 try to get pregnant for a year before consulting a fertility specialist. Women over 35 may want to consult a fertility specialist after 6 months of trying to conceive. Because some women experience light bleeding known as implantation bleeding around the time of the expected menstrual period, or because of irregular menstrual cycles, some women may not realize they are pregnant until specific symptoms of pregnancy start to develop. By this time, the woman may have unknowingly exposed herself to substances that may be harmful for the pregnancy. Women who choose to begin pregnancy planning before conception can take steps to ensure that potentially harmful exposures are avoided."
Why is pregnancy planning important?,"'Before a woman becomes pregnant she can discuss her medical history with a doctor, focusing on the following:'   Chronic medical conditions like diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, or heart disease should be monitored and well controlled prior to conception for the greatest chances of a healthy pregnancy. Women may be tested to determine if they have been infected with the HIV or hepatitis B viruses, so that appropriate treatment during pregnancy or at delivery can help prevent transmission of the infections to the baby. Immunization history and immune response to varicella (chickenpox) and rubella (German measles): the status of a woman's immunity to these two infections, which can cause harm to the developing fetus can be determined by a blood test. If a woman is not immune to these infections, vaccinations can be given before trying to conceive. After receiving the varicella vaccine, women should wait 30 days before attempting conception. Precautions against developing certain other infections should also be taken. Couples who have a history of inherited diseases, have other children with genetic diseases, or who have family histories of certain conditions may choose to undergo genetic counseling prior to conception. Your doctor can help you determine whether genetic counseling is appropriate for you. Smoking cessation dramatically improves the chances of a healthy pregnancy, and women planning pregnancy should abstain from alcohol use. Those with substance abuse problems should ideally be identified and treated prior to planning a pregnancy."
What is a pregnancy calendar or calculator?,"'A ''pregnancy calendar'"" or calculator is a tool that helps a woman determine precisely which changes are taking place in her body and in the fetus at a given week of pregnancy. Calculators are also available to predict a woman's due date. Many versions of pregnancy calendars and calculators can be found online."" "
When can a woman start trying to get pregnant after stopping birth control?,"'A woman is physiologically able to become pregnant as soon as she is no longer using ''birth control''. For certain hormonal methods designed for longer-term ''contraception'', the effects can take some time to wear off so pregnancy is possible when the hormonal effects wear off. There is no evidence to suggest that waiting a few cycles after stopping ''oral contraceptives'' ""''the pill''"" will lead to better pregnancy outcomes.'  "
Is there a special diet for a woman who is planning for a pregnancy?,"'A healthy ''diet'' that provides all the necessary nutrients for the developing fetus increases the chances of a healthy pregnancy. For this reason, it is best to avoid certain diets in pregnancy. In particular, high-fat diets, some ''vegetarian'' diets, and ''weight loss'' diets should generally be avoided by pregnant women. A healthy ''diet'' also means limiting ''sugar'' intake. Many women also choose to start eating a healthy diet in the stage prior to conception to maximize their chances of delivering a healthy baby. In general, a healthy diet is the same for both pregnant women and non-pregnant women, with a few special exceptions that will be discussed below.''Evidence about whether consumption of ''caffeine'' in pregnancy is detrimental has been inconclusive. However, it is known that the fetus metabolizes ''caffeine'' very slowly, so maternal consumption of caffeine results in a prolonged exposure for the fetus. Consumption of typical levels of caffeine has not been associated with any adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet individual studies have shown that caffeine can lead to changes in fetal arousal and ''heart'' rate. According to many experts, including the American Academy of ''Nutrition'' and Dietetics, caffeine intake in pregnant women should be limited to 200 mg per day (equivalent to one 12 oz. cup).''Women who are planning to become pregnant are advised to take folic acid ''supplements'' to reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects in the fetus. The neural tube closes early in pregnancy (18 to 26 days after conception) so supplementation with folic acid is most critical during the early days of pregnancy. Often, supplementation after the diagnosis of pregnancy is too late to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. ''Vitamins'' containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid, taken daily, are recommended.''Due to the presence of certain environmental toxins (such as mercury), the kinds and amount of fish (and shellfish) that are eaten during pregnancy should be regulated. The US FDA has issued guidance for pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy regarding the types and amount of fish that should be eaten.''Megavitamins may not be safe for pregnant women, since excessive doses of vitamins can be harmful and their effects on the fetus have not been fully studied. Megadoses of ''vitamin A'' in early pregnancy have been linked to ''birth defects''. Women planning pregnancy and who are pregnant also are advised not to consume nonessential ''dietary supplements'' or herbal preparations, since their effects on the developing fetus are unknown. The safest choice for women planning a pregnancy is to take a prenatal vitamin supplement that contains folic acid and iron.''Pregnant women also should try to avoid unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, deli and luncheon meats, and undercooked or raw animal foods. This is due to the risk of exposure to ''Listeria'' monocytogenes'', common bacteria that can cause miscarriages and other problems. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well before consumption.' In general, 2-3 servings of fish that are low in mercury are recommended per week. Seafood that is lower in mercury includes salmon, shrimp, Pollock, tuna (light canned), tilapia, catfish, and cod. Tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel are typically high in mercury and should be avoided. Pregnant women should not consume raw fish."
How much weight should you gain during pregnancy?,"""The mother's pre-pregnancy weight should be taken into account when estimating how much weight gain is appropriate for a healthy pregnancy. Women with multiple gestation pregnancies will need to gain more weight to maintain a healthy pregnancy than those with singleton pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued guidelines for recommended weight gain in women who have a singleton pregnancy. They are as follows:"" Underweight women (BMI < 18.5) should gain 28-40 pounds. Normal-weight women (BMI, 18.5-24.9) should gain 25-35 pounds. Overweight women (BMI, 25-29.9) should gain 15-25 pounds Obese women (BMI, 30 or higher) should gain 11-20 pounds."
Can you drink alcohol if you are pregnant?,"'Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions reflecting the possible effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol. These include ''fetal alcohol syndrome'' (''FAS''), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disabilities (ARND). ''Fetal alcohol syndrome'' is a leading cause of cognitive disabilities in children. The exact amount of alcohol exposure that is associated with these disorders has not been determined, so there is no known limit for safe alcohol consumption in pregnancy. For this reason, women planning to conceive and pregnant women are advised not to drink alcohol.' "
Should I exercise when pregnant?,"'Exercise is part of a healthy lifestyle and is recommended for healthy pregnant women who have uncomplicated pregnancies, with a few exceptions. You should always discuss your exercise program with your doctor. Recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology state that pregnant women who have an uncomplicated pregnancy should participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. However, there are some sports with an increased risk of ''trauma'' to the abdomen that should be avoided. These include ice hockey, kickboxing, soccer, and horseback riding. Scuba diving should also be avoided in pregnancy since it poses a risk of decompression sickness (""the bends"") to the fetus.' "
Is it safe to have sexual intercourse during pregnancy?,"'For most women, sex during pregnancy is safe. Your doctor may recommend avoiding sexual intercourse if you have certain conditions or risk factors. These include prior preterm ''labor'', multiple miscarriages, infection, bleeding, ''amniotic fluid'' leak, and ''placenta previa'' (low placenta). Pregnant women should not have sexual activity that would put them at risk for contracting a sexually-transmitted disease (''STD'').' "
Is it safe to diet during pregnancy?,"'Pregnant women should always follow a healthy nutrition plan that is optimized for both mother and baby (see previous sections on dietary considerations and weight gain). A weight reduction diet is not appropriate for pregnant women. Even women who are overweight or obese prior to the pregnancy will need to gain weight during pregnancy, although some may need to gain slightly less weight than normal-weight women. Women who are overweight or obese should discuss with their doctor the best amount of weight gain weight gain for the pregnancy.' "
Is it safe to fly if you are pregnant?,"'According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, occasional air travel in pregnancy is considered safe, and there are no data to show that air travel adversely affects pregnancy outcomes for occasional ''travelers''. Most airlines allow women to fly up to the 36th week of gestation. Women who have high-risk pregnancies and are at risk for preterm ''labor'' or who may require emergency care should avoid air travel. It is generally recommended that pregnant women traveling by air take precaution to decrease their risk of developing ''blood clots'' (thrombi) in the extremities. The use of support stockings, frequent ambulation, and remaining well hydrated can help reduce the risks of developing a ''blood clot'' in the legs during long flights.' "
Can you continue to take medications when you are planning to get pregnant? What about if you are pregnant?,"""Part of pregnancy planning involves attention to underlying or pre-existing medical conditions that may affect a woman's pregnancy. Women who take regular medications should review their medication schedule (including any over-the-counter medications or supplements) with their doctor when planning to conceive. Some medications may be harmful to the fetus, while other ""'drugs'' are safe for pregnant women. It may be necessary to discontinue certain medications or change to alternate medications in some cases. For example, the ''acne'' medication ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane) has been shown to cause birth defects in the fetus.'""In some cases the effects of a particular medication may be unclear in pregnant women. In these cases a decision must be made regarding the necessity of the medication for the mother's health versus possible or unknown risks to the fetus.""'Women taking oral contraceptives who become pregnant are not believed to be at any increased risk for poor outcomes, although the oral contraceptives should be discontinued immediately.''It is safe for women who become ill during pregnancy to be treated with many medications; however, some medications, including some antibiotics and ''pain'' relief medicines, may not be recommended for pregnant women. It is important if you require medication to tell your doctor that you may be pregnant or are trying to conceive.' "
Foods foods should you avoid if you are pregnant? What is rubella? Is there a vaccine?,"'Avoiding certain foods can help prevent infection with ''Listeria'' bacteria, which can cause problems with pregnancy.''Viral infections that can cause problems for the mother and/or the fetus include:''Infection with the parasite ''Toxoplasma''\xa0is a risk for pregnant women.''Rubella viral infection in early pregnancy can cause ''miscarriage'' or birth defects. Therefore, women of childbearing age are tested for immunity to this virus, and those lacking antibodies to the rubella virus should be vaccinated against this virus.'

What are genital herpes and the Parvovirus B19?,"'If a pregnant woman has ''genital herpes'' infection, it is possible to transmit the virus to the baby at the time of delivery. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can have multiple effects in the newborn. The infection may be limited to the eyes, skin and mouth. It may be localized to the central nervous system or may be widespread. Antiviral medications are given to the newborn after delivery. Cesarean delivery (''C-section'') is recommended for most women with an active outbreak of genital HSV infection at the time of ''labor'' to prevent transmission of the infection to the baby.''Parvovirus B19 causes ''fifth disease'', a common mild disease of childhood that is spread by respiratory secretions or blood. Pregnant women who have not previously had ''fifth disease'' should avoid contact with people with the condition since parvovirus B-19 can infect the fetus. About 65% of pregnant women in North America have evidence of previous infection with parvovirus B-19, while acute parvovirus B-19 infection occurs in up to 2% of pregnant women in endemic periods. About 30% of women who develop parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy will transmit the infection across the placenta to the fetus. Although no birth defects have been reported as a result of fifth disease, the infection can cause fetal death. For women who contract parvovirus in the ''first trimester'', the rate of fetal loss can be as high as 10%. Avoiding persons with fifth disease can greatly reduce the chances of becoming infected.' "
"What are hepatitis B and C, HIV, and Chickenpox?","'Hepatitis'' viruses B and C can affect newborns, but ''hepatitis'' B is much more commonly passed from a pregnant woman to her baby. Only about 4% of fetuses exposed to maternal ''hepatitis C'' become infected while that percentage is much higher for those with Hepatitis B (90%).''Infants born to mothers infected with the hepatitis B virus are given both hepatitis B antibodies and hepatitis B vaccinations at birth for protection. Currently there is no effective way to prevent transmission of ''hepatitis C'' in newborns, and the medications used to treat ''hepatitis C'' in adults are not recommended for pregnant woman or infants.''HIV infection can be passed from a mother to the baby. The chances of this happening can be greatly reduced by treating the mother with certain medication regimens during pregnancy.''Varicella, or ''chickenpox'', infection can cause ''pneumonia'' or even death in older adults and in pregnant women. Varicella vaccine is available for women who are not immune to chickenpox. After receiving the varicella vaccine, women should wait 30 days before attempting conception.' "
What is toxoplasma and the Zika virus?,"'Toxoplasma is a parasite that is transmitted through cat feces and raw meats, especially pork. As with infection with the rubella virus, ''toxoplasmosis'' can cause birth defects if the infection occurs during early pregnancy. Women planning pregnancy can decrease the risk of contracting toxoplasmosis by avoiding raw meat and avoid handling cat litter boxes. It is possible to have been exposed to toxoplasmosis and have immunity to the infection without being aware of it Women can have a blood test to determine if they have immunity to toxoplasmosis; if the test is positive for toxoplasmosis immunity, the woman will not develop toxoplasmosis complications during pregnancy. There is no vaccine available to prevent toxoplasmosis.''Zika virus'' is a Flavivirus that is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. The illness that follows may last for a few days to a week and causes signs and symptoms like ''conjunctivitis'' (''redness of the eyes''), ''rash'', ''fever'', and ''joint pain''. The virus has been traditionally reported in Indonesia and Africa, but it has continued to spread through North and South America including the U.S. The viral infection has been associated with to birth defects (mainly small brain size and ''small head'', known as ''microcephaly'', as well as certain eye defects that can cause ''vision loss'') in ''babies'' whose mothers contracted ''Zika virus'' infections during pregnancy. While mosquito-borne transmission is the usual route of spread, the virus may less commonly be spread through sexual intercourse, through blood transfusions, or from mother to fetus.''The US Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) maintains a web site with up-to-date information on the risks of contracting ''Zika'' virus in specific areas of the world. Pregnant women should avoid travel to an area where ''Zika'' virus transmission is occurring. An updated list of areas that should be avoided by pregnant women can be found at the CDC web site (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices). Also, pregnant women with a male partner who lives in or has traveled to an area with an active ''Zika'' infection should use ''condoms'' during sex or abstain from sex until the pregnancy is over.'

What is premature menopause?,"""Menopause is the time in a woman's life when menstrual periods cease. It is defined medically as the absence of menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months. The average age for a ""'natural menopause'' is 51. Sometimes, menopause occurs earlier, due to diseases, genetic factors, or surgery. There is also a wide variation among women regarding the timing of normal menopause.'  "
What causes early menopause?,"'As mentioned previously, menopause before the age of 40 are considered to be in premature, or early, menopause. One medical causes of premature menopause is known as premature ovarian failure. Technically, premature ovarian failure is not the same as premature menopause. In premature ovarian failure, the ovaries stop functioning normally before the age of 40. Women with premature ovarian failure may still occasionally have menstrual periods, but they typically experience ''infertility''. Premature ovarian failure is usually accompanied ''primary ovarian insufficiency''. Premature ovarian failure is usually accompanied by the symptoms of premature menopause.''Premature menopause can also be caused by treatments for ''cancers'' or other conditions that involve chemotherapy and/or ''radiation therapy'' to the pelvis. These treatments can damage the ovaries and result in ovarian failure.''Surgery to remove the ovaries, either for benign or ''malignant'' conditions, results in premature menopause if both ovaries are removed. Surgery to remove the uterus results in menopause only in the sense that menstrual bleeding does not occur. In that case, the ovaries will continue to produce hormones.''Other infrequent causes that may lead to premature menopause include ''drugs'', chronic diseases, pituitary and hypothalamic tumors, psychiatric disorders, and other relatively rare or undefined conditions.'  "
Risk factors for early menopause,"'Premature ovarian failure affects about 1 out of every 1000 women from ages 15 to 29 and about 1 out of every 100 women aged 30 to 39. It can be related to genetic (''inherited'') factors, to illnesses like autoimmune diseases, ''thyroid disease'', viral infection, hormonal disorders, and ''eating disorders''. The risk of premature ovarian failure risk increases in women who have relatives with the condition.''Women at risk for surgical or treatment-''induced menopause'' are those who are undergoing treatment for ''cancer'' or other conditions that require surgical removal of the female organs.' "
Signs and symptoms of early menopause,"'The symptoms of premature menopause are those of typical menopause. They can include:''Irregular periods usually precede menopause, and can begin years before periods actually cease.'  Mood swings Vaginal dryness Changes in cognition and memory Hot flashes Diminished desire for sex Sleep disturbances Weight gain Night sweats Vaginal pain during intercourse"
How is early menopause is diagnosed?,"'No special tests are needed to determine the absence of menstrual periods, but sometimes women begin having ''symptoms of menopause'' and irregular periods. At that point, they may be tested to determine their ovarian function. For example, tests may be done to rule out ''pregnancy'' or other causes of missed ''menstruation'', such as certain thyroid diseases. The level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is often measured in the blood to determine whether a woman is nearing menopause and to ascertain the functional status of her ovaries. FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen, so levels of this hormone rise when estrogen levels drop. FSH levels that are higher than 40 mIU/ml are considered diagnostic of the menopause. Levels of ovarian hormones, such as estradiol, may be also measured, as low levels (levels less than 32 pg/ml) are suggestive of menopause.' "
Treatments to relieve signs and symptoms,"'There is no treatment that can reverse or prevent premature menopause. However, women who have reached menopause do have treatment options that can help control unpleasant symptoms.''Types of treatments for symptom relief include:'  Hormone therapy: hormone therapy (HT, or estrogen therapy, ET) is available in different forms including pills, patches, transdermal sprays, or gels or creams. Localized hormone treatments are also available for intravaginal use. HT/ET is the most effective way to control symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Because HT/ET has been associated with certain health risks (heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer), experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of hormone therapy for the shortest period of time necessary for symptom control. Oral contraceptive pills are a form of HT that is sometimes used to help relieve menopausal symptoms. Antidepressant medications: the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related medications have been shown to be effective in controlling the symptoms of hot flashes in up to 60% of women. Non-hormonal vaginal gels, creams, and lubricants can help prevent the symptoms of vaginal dryness. Assisted reproductive technologies: in selected cases, pregnancy may be achieved using donor eggs in women with premature menopause."
What are complications of premature menopause?,"'Women with premature menopause are faced with the challenges of infertility if they desire pregnancy. This can be accompanied by feelings of emotional distress and ''depression''.''There is also an increased risk of ''osteoporosis'' in women with low estrogen levels. Women with premature menopause have a longer time period of their life of decreased estrogen production and this, in turn, increases their risk for low ''bone density''. This risk may be offset by taking calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements'', consuming plenty of dietary calcium, and obtaining weigh-bearing ''exercise''.' "
What is the outlook for a woman in early menopause?,"'The prognosis for women with premature menopause is related to the circumstances and cause of the condition. If premature menopause occurs due to surgery or ''cancer'' treatments, the prognosis is related to the underlying reasons for these treatments. Women with premature ovarian failure for undefined causes may be at increased risk for ''osteoporosis'', as mentioned above. These women may also be susceptible to ''cardiovascular disease'' in later in life, although this risk has not been fully studied.' "
What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?,"""Health care providers use the term POI when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40 years of age.""'1,2''''Many women naturally experience reduced ''fertility'' when they are around 40 years old. This age may mark the start of irregular menstrual periods that signal the onset of ''menopause''. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility occur before the age of 40, sometimes as early as the teenage years.''3,4''''In the past, POI used to be called ""''premature menopause''"" or ""premature ovarian failure,"" but those terms do not accurately describe what happens in a woman with POI. A woman who has gone through ''menopause'' will never have another normal period and cannot get ''pregnant''. A woman with POI may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly, and she may still get pregnant.''2,4' "
What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'The first sign of POI is usually menstrual irregularities or missed periods,''2'' which is sometimes called ''amenorrhea'' (pronounced ey-men-uh-REE-uh or uh-men-uh-REE-uh).''In addition, some women with POI have symptoms similar to those experienced by women who are going through ''natural menopause'', including:''For many women with POI, trouble ''getting pregnant'' or ''infertility'' is the first symptom they experience and is what leads them to visit their health care provider. This is sometimes called ""occult"" (hidden) or early POI.''6' Hot flashes Night sweats Irritability Poor concentration Decreased sex drive Pain during sex Vaginal dryness1,5"
How many women are affected by or at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'Estimates suggest that about 1% of women and teenage girls in the United States have POI.''1'' Researchers estimate that, categorized by age, POI affects:'""Several factors can affect a woman's risk for POI:"" 1 in 10,000 women by age 20 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 1 in 250 women by age 35 1 in 100 women by age 408 Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have the disorder. About 10% to 20% of women with POI have a family history of the condition.8 Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. Research suggests that these disorders and conditions cause as much as 28% of POI cases.9 For example:
Women who carry a variation of the gene for Fragile X syndrome are at higher risk for Fragile X-Associated POI (FXPOI). 10 Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual and developmental disability, but women with FXPOI do not have Fragile X syndrome itself. Instead, they have a change or mutation in the same gene that causes Fragile X syndrome, and this change is linked to FXPOI. 
Most women who have Turner syndrome develop POI. Turner syndrome is a condition in which a girl or woman is partially or completely missing an X chromosome. Most women are XX, meaning they have two X chromosomes. Women with Turner syndrome are X0, meaning one of the X chromosomes is missing.

What causes primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is a mystery.''4,6,11''Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles (pronounced FOL-i-kulz)—the small sacs in the ovaries in which eggs grow and mature.''6''Follicles start out as microscopic seeds called primordial (pronounced prahy-MAWR-dee-uhl) follicles. These seeds are not yet follicles, but they can grow into them. Normally, a woman is born with approximately 2 million primordial follicles,''12'' typically enough to last until she goes through natural ''menopause'', usually around age 50.''4''For a woman with POI, there are problems with the follicles:''1''Although the exact cause is unknown in a majority of cases, some causes of follicle depletion and dysfunction have been identified:' Follicle depletion. A woman with follicle depletion runs out of working follicles earlier than normal or expected. In the case of POI, the woman runs out of working follicles before natural menopause occurs around age 50. Presently there is no safe way for scientists today to make primordial follicles. Follicle dysfunction. A woman with follicle dysfunction has follicles remaining in her ovaries, but the follicles are not working properly. Scientists do not have a safe and effective way to make follicles start working normally again.6 Genetic and chromosomal disorders. Disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome can cause follicle depletion.6,8,12 Low number of follicles. Some women are born with fewer primordial follicles, so they have a smaller pool of follicles to use throughout their lives. Even though only one mature follicle releases an egg each month, less mature follicles usually develop along with that mature follicle and egg. Scientists don't understand exactly why this happens, but these ""supporting"" follicles seem to help the mature follicle function normally. If these extra follicles are missing, the main follicle will not mature and release an egg properly. Autoimmune diseases. Typically, the body's immune cells protect the body from invading bacteria and viruses. However, in autoimmune diseases, immune cells turn on healthy tissue. In the case of POI, the immune system may damage developing follicles in the ovaries. It could also damage the glands that make the hormones needed for the ovaries and follicles to work properly. Recent studies suggest that about 20% of women with POI have an autoimmune disease.4,13
Thyroiditis (pronounced thahy-roi-DAHY-tis) is the autoimmune disorder most commonly associated with POI.13 It is an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which makes hormones that control metabolism, or the pace of body processes.
Addison's disease is also associated with POI. Addison's disease affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that help the body respond to physical stress, such as illness and injury; the hormones also affect ovary function.14 About 3% of women with POI have Addison's disease.15

These strong treatments for cancer may damage the genetic material in cells, including follicle cells.2,6,11 Metabolic disorders. These disorders affect the body's ability to create, store, and use the energy it needs. For example, galactosemia (pronounced guh-lak-tuh-SEE-mee-uh) affects how your body processes galactose (guh-LAK-tohs), a type of sugar. More than 80% of women and girls with galactosemia also have POI.13 Toxins. Cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticides can speed up follicle depletion. In addition, viruses have been shown to affect follicle function.4,12"
How is primary ovarian insufficiency diagnosed?,"'The key signs of POI are:''If a woman is younger than age 40 and begins having irregular periods or stops having periods for 4 months or longer, her health care provider may take these steps to diagnose the problem:'""The health care provider will also ask questions about a woman's medical history. He or she may ask about:""'If they do not do tests to rule out POI, some health care providers might assume missed periods are related to ''stress''.''4'' However, this approach is problematic because it will lead to a delay in diagnosis; further evaluation is needed.''4' Missed or irregular periods for 4 months, typically after having had regular periods for a while High levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Low levels of estrogen4,6,13 Do a 
	pregnancy test. This test will rule out an unexpected pregnancy as the reason for 
	missed 
	periods.4 Do a physical exam. During the physical exam, the health care provider looks for signs of other disorders. In some cases, the presence of these other disorders will rule out POI. Or, if the other disorders are associated with POI, such as Addison's disease, a health care provider will know that POI may be present.4 Collect blood. The health care provider will collect your blood and send it to a lab, where a technician will run several tests, including:
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) test. FSH signals the ovaries to make estrogen, sometimes called the ""female hormone"" because women need high levels of it for fertility and overall health. If the ovaries are not working properly, as is the case in POI, the level of FSH in the blood increases. The health care provider may do two FSH tests, at least a month apart. If the FSH level in both tests is as high as it is in women who have gone through menopause, then POI is likely.4
Luteinizing (pronounced LOO-tee-uh-nahyz-ing) hormone (LH) test. LH signals a mature follicle to release an egg. Women with POI have high LH levels, more evidence that the follicles are not functioning normally.1
Estrogen test. In women with POI, estrogen levels are usually low, because the ovaries are not functioning properly in their role as estrogen producers.1,6
Karyotype (pronounced KAR-ee-uh-tahyp) test. This test looks at all 46 of your chromosomes to check for abnormalities. The karyotype test could reveal genetic changes in the structure of chromosomes that might be associated with POI and other health problems.1,4

A sonogram can show whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles.4,11 A blood relative with POI or its symptoms A blood relative with Fragile X syndrome or an unidentified intellectual or developmental disability Ovarian surgery Radiation or chemotherapy treatment Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or other 
	sexually transmitted infections An endocrine disorder, such as diabetes4"
Are there associated disorders or conditions associated with primary ovarian insufficiency?,"'Because POI results in lower levels of certain hormones, women with POI are at greater risk for a number of health conditions, including:'""Addison's disease is also associated with POI. Addison's disease is a life-threatening condition that affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that help the body respond to physical stress, such as illness and injury. These hormones also affect ovary function.""'14'"" About 3% of women with POI have Addison's disease.""'15' Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break and fracture.1 Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism (pronounced hahy-puh-THAHY-roi-diz-uhm). The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels of the hormones made by the thyroid can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy and mental sluggishness. 
	Cold feet and constipation are also features of low thyroid function. Researchers estimate that between 14% and 27% of women with POI also have low thyroid function.4 Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression.16 Women diagnosed with POI can be shy, anxious in social settings, and may have low self-esteem more often than women without POI.4 It is possible that depression may contribute to POI.16 Cardiovascular (heart) disease. Lower levels of estrogen, as seen in POI, can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. Both factors increase the risk of atherosclerosis (pronounced ath-uh-roh-skluh-ROH-sis) - or hardening of the arteries - which can slow or block the flow of blood to the heart. Women with POI have higher rates of illness and death from heart disease than do women without POI.1,6,11 Dry eye syndrome and ocular (eye) surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these conditions, which cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision.4 If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage."
What are the treatments for primary ovarian insufficiency?,"""Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.""'1,2'' But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI, as well as treatments and behaviors to reduce health risks and conditions associated with POI.''It is also important to note that between 5% and 10% of women with POI get pregnant without medical intervention after they are diagnosed with POI. Some research suggests that these women go into what is known as ""spontaneous remission"" of POI, meaning that the ovaries begin to function normally on their own. When the ovaries are working properly, fertility is restored and the women can get pregnant.' "
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),"'HRT'' is the most common treatment for women with POI. It gives the body the estrogen and other hormones that the ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for ''cardiovascular disease'' (including heart attacks, ''stroke'', and ''high blood pressure'') and ''osteoporosis''.''17''''If a woman with POI begins HRT, she is expected to start having regular periods again. In addition, HRT is expected to reduce other symptoms, such as ''hot flashes'' and night sweats, and help maintain bone health.''1,13,17,26'' HRT will not prevent pregnancy, and evidence suggests it might improve pregnancy rates for women with POI by lowering high levels of luteinizing hormone - which stimulates ''ovulation'' - to normal in some women.''19''''HRT is usually a combination of an estrogen and a progestin. A progestin is a form of ''progesterone''. Sometimes, the combination might also include testosterone, although this approach is controversial.''11'' HRT comes in several forms: pills, creams, gels, patches that stick onto the skin, an ''intrauterine device'', or a vaginal ring.''14'' ''Estradiol'' is the natural form of human estrogen. The optimal method of providing estradiol to women with POI is by a skin patch or vaginal ring. These methods are linked with a lower risk of potentially fatal ''blood clots'' developing. Most women require a dose of 100 micrograms of estradiol per day. It is important to take a progestin along with estradiol to balance out the effect of estrogen on the lining of the womb. Women who do not take a progestin along with estradiol are at increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer''. The progestin with the best evidence available to support use in women with POI is 10 mg of''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate by mouth per day for the first 12 calendar days of each month.''A health care provider may suggest that a woman with POI take HRT until she is about 50 years old, the age at which menopause usually begins.''After that time, she should talk with her health care provider about stopping the treatment because of risks associated with using this type of therapy in the years after the normal age of menopause.''4'""In general, HRT treatment for women with POI is safe and is associated with only minimal side effects. Women with POI take HRT to replace hormones their bodies would normally be making if they didn't have POI.""'The HRT taken by women with POI is different from the hormone therapies taken by women who are going through or have gone through natural menopause, which are often called menopausal or post-menopausal ''hormone therapy'' (PMHT).''A large, long-term study - called the '""Women's Health""' Initiative - examined the effects of a specific type of PMHT, taken for more than 5 years, by women ages 50 to 79 who had already gone through menopause. This study showed that PMHT was associated with an increased risk of ''stroke'', blood clots, ''heart disease'', heart attacks, and ''breast cancer'' in these women.''20''These results do not apply to young women with POI who take HRT.''4,14'' The type and amount of HRT prescribed to women with POI is different from the PMHT taken by older women.''4''A woman should talk to her health care provider if she has questions about HRT as a treatment for POI. Also, she should tell her health care provider about any side effects she experiences while taking HRT. There are many different types of HRT. Women should work with their health care providers to find out the best type of treatment.' "
Calcium and vitamin D supplements,"'Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, they should get at least 1,200 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium and 1000 IU (international units) of ''vitamin D'', which helps the body absorb calcium, every day.''21'' These nutrients are important for bone health.''14'' A health care provider may do a ''bone mineral density'' test to check for bone loss.''19' "
Regular physical activity and healthy body weight,"'Weight-bearing physical activity, such as ''walking'', jogging, and stair climbing, helps build bone strength and prevents osteoporosis.''14'' Maintaining a healthy body weight and getting regular physical activity are also important for reducing the risk of ''heart disease''. These factors can affect ''cholesterol levels'', which in turn can change the risk for heart disease.''22' "
Treatments for associated conditions,"""POI is associated with other health conditions, including (but not limited to) Addison's disease,Fragile X permutation, thyroid dysfunction, ""'depression'', ''anxiety'', and certain other genetic, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders.''Women who have POI as well as one of these associated conditions will require additional treatment for the associated condition. In some cases, treatment involves medication or hormone therapy. Other types of treatments might also be needed.' "
Emotional support,"'For many women who experience ''infertility'', including those with POI, feelings of loss are common. In one study, almost 9 out of 10 women reported feeling moderate to severe emotional distress when they learned of their POI diagnosis.''14, 26''\u200b Several organizations offer help finding these types of professionals. ' "
POI in teens,"'Receiving a diagnosis of POI can be emotionally difficult for teenagers and their parents. A teen may have a similar emotional experience as an adult who receives the diagnosis, but there are many aspects of the experience that are unique to being a teenager. It is important for parents, the teenager, and health care providers to work closely together to ensure that the teenager gets the right treatment and maintains her emotional and physical health in the long term. There are resources to provide advice and support for parents, teenagers, and health care providers.''25'' ' "
What are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)?,"'Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, PVC) are premature heartbeats originating from the ventricles of the ''heart''. Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat.''Normal function of the heart''The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles.''The heartbeat is normally controlled by the electrical system of the heart. The electrical system of the heart consists of the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node and special tissues in the ventricles that conduct electricity.'""The SA node is the heart's electrical ""'pacemaker''. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the ''right atrium''; the frequency with which the SA node discharges electricity determines the rate at which the heart normally beats. The SA node keeps the heart beating in a regular manner. At rest, the frequency of the electrical discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate at which the heart beats. In people who ''exercise'' regularly, the resting heart rate may be below 50 to 60 and is not of concern.''The electrical discharges pass from the SA node through the special tissues of the atria into the ''AV node'' and through the ''AV node'' to the special conduction tissues of the ventricles, causing them to contract.''{C}'   The atria deliver blood to the ventricles, and the ventricles deliver blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body. The right ventricle delivers blood to the lungs while the left ventricle delivers blood to the rest of the body. The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles."
What happens during a premature ventricular contraction?,"'During a premature ventricular contraction, the ventricle electrically discharges (and contracts) prematurely before the normal electrical discharges arrive from the SA node. These premature discharges are due to electrical ""irritability"" of the heart muscle of the ventricles and can be caused by ''heart attacks'', ''electrolyte'' imbalances, lack of oxygen, or medications. Immediately after a premature ventricular contraction, the electrical system of the heart resets. This resetting causes a brief pause in heartbeat, and some patients report feeling the heart briefly stopping after a premature ventricular contraction. ' "
How common are premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions are common. Many people have premature ventricular contractions without any symptoms. Premature ventricular contractions may be more common among older patients, patients with ''high blood pressure'', and patients with ''heart disease''. Premature ventricular contractions can also occur in young healthy individuals without ''heart disease'' or ''high blood pressure''. ' "
What causes premature ventricular contractions?,"'There are many causes of premature ventricular contractions, which include'   heart attack; high blood pressure;  cardiomyopathy, including congestive heart failure;  disease of heart valves such as mitral valve prolapse;  hypokalemia (low blood levels of potassium), and hypomagnesaemia (low blood levels of magnesium) -- hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia can occur, for example, in patients taking diuretics (water pills); hypoxia (low amounts of oxygen in the blood), for example, hypoxia occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);  medications such as digoxin (Lanoxin), aminophylline (Phyllocontin, Truphylline), tricyclic antidepressants, and ephedrine-containing, decongestants; excessive intake of alcohol; excess caffeine intake; stimulant drug use such as cocaine, and amphetamines;  myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and cardiac contusion (heart muscle injury), and  premature ventricular contractions also occur in healthy individuals without heart diseases. "
What are premature ventricular contraction symptoms?,"'Patients with mild infrequent premature ventricular contractions often report no symptoms (asymptomatic) and are unaware of their premature ventricular contractions. Their premature ventricular contractions may be discovered when an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'') is performed for a routine physical, insurance physical, or preoperative evaluation.''Patients with premature ventricular contractions sometimes report ''palpitations'' in the chest and in the neck. ''Palpitations'' are discomforting feelings due to forceful heartbeats. The heartbeat immediately after a premature ventricular contraction is usually stronger (the ''heart ventricle'' contracts more forcefully) than normal. Patients with premature ventricular contractions may report feeling that the heart has stopped briefly. This is because there is usually a brief pause in heartbeat after a premature ventricular contraction when the electrical system of the heart resets. Moreover, the actual premature ventricular contraction beat may not be felt because the heart hasn\'t had time to fill with blood before beating so patients with PVCs often complain of ""skipped"" or ""missed"" beats.''Patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions such as bigeminy (every other heartbeat is a premature ventricular contraction), couplets (two consecutive premature ventricular contractions), or triplets (three consecutive premature ventricular contractions) often report no symptoms. But in rare occasions they may report ''weakness'', ''dizziness'', or ''fainting''. This is because frequent premature ventricular contractions can diminish the ability of the heart to pump blood to the other organs (diminished cardiac output), resulting in ''low blood pressure''.''Patients with three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions in a row have ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia that is prolonged can result in low cardiac output, ''low blood pressure'', and ''fainting'' (''syncope''). Ventricular tachycardia can also develop into ventricular ''fibrillation'', which is a fatal heart rhythm (see below).'  "
What are the dangers of premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions in healthy individuals without ''high blood pressure'' and heart diseases do not pose any health risks. Premature ventricular contractions in patients with heart diseases (''heart attacks'', ''heart failure'', diseases of the heart valves) may be associated with increased risks of developing ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is a sustained run of rapid ventricular contractions. Ventricular tachycardia is life-threatening because: 1) it occurs suddenly with no prior warning, and 2) it frequently develops into ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm where the ventricles quiver rapidly in a purposeless fashion. The heart with ventricular fibrillation cannot pump blood effectively to the brain and the rest of the body. If untreated, ventricular fibrillation can be fatal within minutes. An estimated 325,000 Americans die from ''sudden cardiac arrest'', including ventricular fibrillation, each year. Many doctors believe that premature ventricular contractions do not necessarily cause ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillations. Instead, premature ventricular contractions may be merely indicators (symptoms) of serious heart diseases or other serious conditions such as hypokalemia, hypoxia, and ongoing heart damage from ''heart attacks'', or medications such as digoxin and aminophylline toxicity. It must be emphasized that many premature ventricular contractions are harmless (benign) and not associated with structural ''heart disease''. If the workup for underlying heart disease is unrevealing, the patient can be assured that their prognosis is excellent.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (EKG and Holter)?,"'There are two aspects in the diagnosis of premature ventricular contractions -- detecting them and diagnosing the underlying causes. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) and Holter monitors are used to diagnose premature ventricular contractions. EKGs, blood tests, echocardiograms, and cardiac ''stress'' tests are used to determine the underlying causes of premature ventricular contractions.''Electrocardiogram (EKG)'""An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. EKGs can be performed in the doctors' offices, clinics, and hospital emergency rooms. Doctors frequently ask for a rhythm strip (a prolonged EKG recording) to be performed at the same time as an EKG to increase the chances of detecting premature ventricular contractions and other abnormal rhythms. The premature ventricular contractions are easy to recognize on EKG and rhythms strips, provided premature ventricular contractions occur during the recording. EKG may also demonstrate other problems such as heart attacks, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, and heart muscle thickening (hypertrophy) due to long term high ""'blood pressure''.''Holter monitor'""A standard EKG and a rhythm strip performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not detect the premature ventricular contractions because they may not be occurring at that moment. Holter monitoring is then necessary to detect the premature ventricular contractions in these patients with heart palpitations. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours. Holter monitoring can be used diagnose premature ventricular contractions as well as other heart rhythm abnormalities such as ""'atrial fibrillation'', ''atrial flutter'', and ventricular tachycardias.'""PVCs are present in 1% to 4% in the general population. PVCs can be demonstrated during Holter monitoring. However, not all premature ventricular contractions found during Holter monitoring are clinically important. Doctors interpreting the Holter monitoring studies must take into account the patient's medical history in determining the importance of Holter monitor findings.""'In patients with infrequent symptoms an event marker may be used in lieu of a Holter monitor as this can be worn for up to 30 days.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (echo and stress test)? ,"'Echocardiography''Echocardiography uses ''ultrasound'"" waves to produce images of the heart's chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Echocardiography is useful in measuring the size of the heart chambers, the forcefulness of heart ventricle contractions, the thickness of the heart muscles, and the functioning of the heart valves. Echocardiography is therefore useful in diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions such as:""'Exercise ''cardiac stress test'' (''treadmill stress test'')''Exercise cardiac stress testing'' (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac ''stress'"" test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at 3-minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes may be observed in the EKG, including increases in premature ventricular contractions and development of ventricular tachycardias."" Mitral valve prolapse: Echocardiography can detect and measure the severity of mitral valve prolapse and other valvular diseases. Muscle hypertrophy: Echocardiography can detect heart muscle hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle) as a result of long-term high blood pressure. Heart muscle damage: Echocardiography can measure the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks or cardiomyopathy. Ejection fraction: Echocardiography can be used to calculate the ejection fraction of the left ventricle. Ejection fraction is a measure (estimate) of the amount of blood pumped during each contraction of the ventricle. Heart ventricles extensively weakened by heart attacks or cardiomyopathy will have low ejection fractions. Patients with low ejection fractions have higher risks of developing life-threatening ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations than patients with normal ejection fractions."
How is premature ventricular contraction diagnosed  (ECST and blood tests)? ,"'Adjuncts to ECST (stress echo and nuclear imaging)''Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ultrasound are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of ''cardiovascular disease'', if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant cardiovascular disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. Alternatively, nuclear imaging may be used as an adjunct to ECST and may be even more sensitive in noninvasively detecting underlying ''coronary artery disease''.''Blood tests in diagnosing causes of premature ventricular contractions''Blood tests for diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions include:' blood electrolyte levels can be performed to detect low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia); blood drug levels can be performed to detect digoxin and aminophylline drug toxicity or thyroid levels, for example, an overactive thyroid may result in premature ventricular contractions; blood oxygenation (oximetry) can be measured to detect hypoxia; blood tests can be performed to detect illicit drugs, such as amphetamine abuse; and blood levels of cardiac enzymes (creatine phosphokinase [CPK], troponins [regulatory proteins]) can be performed to assess for heart muscle damage as a result of heart attacks."
What are the reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions?,"'The reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions are:''In healthy individuals without heart disease, premature ventricular contractions need no treatment. For relief of palpitations, one may consider the following measures:'""Conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions can also be potentiality life-threatening. These conditions are often treated in hospital-monitored beds. Monitored beds are beds (or rooms) that are equipped to record the patients' heart rhythm continuously. Patients are also given intravenous medications. These conditions are:""   to relieve symptoms of palpitations; to treat conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions since many conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions are potentially life threatening; and to prevent ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. stop alcohol and caffeine intake; stop the use of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestants that may contain adrenaline such as medications containing pseudoephedrine (certain weight loss supplements may aggravate premature ventricular contractions and should never be used without consulting with one's physician); stop drug abuse such as amphetamines, cocaine; and stop cigarette smoking. low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia) -- potassium and magnesium can be given intravenously; digoxin and aminophylline toxicity -- medications can be given to counteract drug toxicity; acute heart attack -- medications and procedures (coronary angiogram and PTCA) are performed urgently to open blocked coronary arteries to restore blood supply to the heart muscle; and low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) -- oxygen can be given nasally and medications can be given to treat the underlying lung diseases."
What medications treat premature ventricular contractions?,"'Antiarrhythmia medications''Antiarrhythmia medications are used to control premature ventricular contractions with the goal of preventing ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death. Examples of antiarrhythmia medications include ''beta-blockers'' ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'') and several others. Unfortunately, there is little scientific evidence that suppressing premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic medications prevents ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death.''Some antiarrhythmia medications actually can cause ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Thus antiarrhythmic medications are only prescribed cautiously in patients at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and usually initially in the hospital setting. This does not apply to beta-blockers, which are prescribed to many heart patients for many reasons, and not only do not accelerate arrhythmias, but usually decrease premature ventricular contractions. In many patients with premature ventricular contractions and significant underlying cardiac disease, or with severe symptoms, electrophysiology testing (EP) may be recommended. This is a test performed with catheters to see if a patient is at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, which are treated with either medications or sometimes tiny implantable defibrillators.' "
What is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)?,"'Premenstrual'' dysphoric disorder (PMDD) can be considered a severe form of ''premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS''). Both ''PMS'"" and PMDD are characterized by unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms that occur in the second half of a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'', most commonly in the days preceding the ''menstrual period''. Physical symptoms such as ''bloating'', breast tenderness, ''headaches'', ''joint pain'', food cravings, ''mood swings'' or frequent crying, ''panic attacks'', ''fatigue'', ''mood changes'', irritability, and trouble focusing are among the most common symptoms. Other symptoms like ''anxiety'' and trouble sleeping have been reported. ''PMS symptoms'"" may be troubling and unpleasant. PMDD may cause severe, debilitating symptoms that interfere with a woman's ability to function.""'The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) estimates that at least 85 percent of menstruating women have at least one ''PMS'' symptom as part of their monthly cycle. PMS is much more common than PMDD. You must have 5 or more of the symptoms listed above to be diagnosed with PMDD.''Biologic, psychological, environmental, and social factors all seem to play a part in PMDD. It is important to note that PMDD is not the fault of the woman suffering from it or the result of a ""weak"" or unstable personality. It is also not something that is ""all in the woman\'s head."" Rather, PMDD is a medical illness that impacts only 3% to 8% of women. Fortunately, it can be treated by a health care professional with behavioral and pharmaceutical options.''PMDD has been previously medically referred to as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder.'  "
What are the symptoms of PMDD?,"'Symptoms of PMS'' and PMDD can be similar but are more intense and debilitating in PMDD. The symptoms of PMDD also may vary among affected women. Some of the most commonly reported symptoms include:''PMDD symptoms are related to the ''menstrual cycle'', typically occurring in the second half (luteal phase) of the cycle, and resolving within the first few days after the ''menstrual period'' has begun.'   Fatigue Mood changes Abdominal bloating Breast tenderness Headache Irritability Depression Increased appetite Acne Oversensitivity to environmental stimuli Hot flashes, Heart palpitations Easy crying Difficulty concentrating Dizziness Sleeplessness Forgetfulness Gastrointestinal (stomach, bowel) upset"
What causes PMDD?,"'Although the precise cause of PMS and PMDD is unknown, it is believed that these conditions result from the interaction of hormones produced by the ovaries at different stages in the menstrual cycle (such as estrogen and ''progesterone'"") with the neurotransmitters (chemicals that serve as messengers such as serotonin) in the brain. While the ovarian hormone levels are normal in women with PMDD, it is likely that the brain's response to these normally-fluctuating hormone levels is abnormal.""'Most evidence suggests that PMS and PMDD do not result from any specific personality traits or personality types. While ''stress'' clearly is associated with PMS and PMDD, it is not considered to be a cause of PMDD. Rather, the associated ''stress'' is more likely to be a result of the PMS or PMDD symptoms. Vitamin or other nutritional deficiencies have not been shown to cause PMS or PMDD.'  "
When should I call a doctor about PMDD?,'It is appropriate to seek medical care for troubling physical or emotional symptoms related to the menstrual cycle.''It is important to note that the depressive symptoms of PMDD may be associated with thoughts of ''suicide'' and ''suicidal'' behavior. This is a medical emergency for which medical attention should be accessed immediately.' 
What vitamins and natural home remedies treat and provide pain relief and other symptoms of PMDD?,"'Other treatments have been shown in some studies to be beneficial in managing PMDD symptoms. Chasteberry extract (agnus castus fruit) was effective in decreasing the ''symptoms of PMS'' in a controlled trial. Several ''dietary supplements'', including calcium, vitamin B6, and ''vitamin E'', have also been shown in limited studies to reduce PMS/PMDD symptoms.' "
How is PMDD diagnosed?,"'PMDD must be distinguished from other physical and psychological conditions that can produce the same symptoms. The differential diagnosis (list of conditions that may produce the same symptoms) includes both mood and ''anxiety'' disorders as well as medical conditions such as ''thyroid disease''. In addition to a thorough medical history and physical examination, blood tests may be performed to rule out whether medical conditions may be present that may account for the PMDD symptoms.''If PMDD is a concern, it is recommended that women complete a symptom chart or calendar prospectively (meaning that they record their symptoms each day for a given period) to establish the diagnosis. The symptom chart can be compared with the menstrual calendar to illustrate the relationship of symptoms to the menstrual cycle.''The American Psychiatric Association has established formal guidelines for the diagnosis of PMDD in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The DSM diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PMDD require prospective documentation of symptoms being present for most menstrual cycles.'""Five or more of the following symptoms must have been present during the week prior to the menstrual period and resolve within a few days of the start of the woman's period. The symptoms must interfere with the activities of a woman's daily living and not be a result of another condition or illness. At least one of the symptoms must be one of the first four on the list:""'Other physical symptoms of PMDD include:' Feeling sad, hopeless, or self-deprecating Feeling tense, anxious, or ""on edge"" Marked changes in mood, becoming sad or tearful Persistent irritability, anger, and increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities, which may be associated with withdrawal from social relationships Difficulty concentrating Feeling fatigued, lethargic, or lacking in energy Marked changes in appetite, which may be associated with binge eating or craving certain foods Hypersomnia (excessive sleeping) or insomnia A subjective feeling of being overwhelmed or out of control Breast tenderness or swelling Headaches Joint or muscle pain A sensation of feeling bloated Weight gain"
Antidepressants (SSRIs) to treat and manage PMDD symptoms,"'A number of medical therapies have been shown to be effective in managing PMDD symptoms.''Several members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of medications are effective in the treatment of PMDD. These medications work by regulating the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. SSRIs that have shown to be effective in the treatment of PMDD include:''Up to 75% of women report relief of symptoms when treated with SSRI medications. Side effects can occur in up to 15% of women and include ''nausea'', ''anxiety'', and ''headache''. SSRI medications to treat PMDD may be prescribed to be taken continuously or only during the 14-day luteal phase (second half) of the menstrual cycle. Other types of ''antidepressants'' (''tricyclic antidepressants'' and ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'') and ''lithium'' (''Lithobid'') have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of PMDD.'   fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)."
Oral contraceptives and GnRH agonists treat PMDD,"'Medications that interfere with ''ovulation'' and the production of ovarian hormones have also been used to treat PMDD. Oral ''contraceptive'' pills (OCPs, ''birth control pills'') can be prescribed to suppress ovulation and regulate the menstrual cycle.''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH analogs or GnRH agonists) have also been used to treat PMDD. These ''drugs'' suppress estrogen production by the ovaries by inhibiting the secretion of regulatory hormones from the ''pituitary gland''. As a result, menstrual periods stop, mimicking ''menopause''. Nasal and injection forms of GnRH agonists are available.''Examples of GnRH agonists include:''The side effects of GnRH agonist drugs are a result of the lack of estrogen, and include:''Adding back small amounts of estrogen and ''progesterone'' can help avoid or minimize many of the annoying side effects due to estrogen deficiency and help preserve ''bone density''.' leuprolide (Lupron) nafarelin (Synarel) goserelin (Zoladex) Hot flashes Vaginal dryness Irregular vaginal bleeding Mood changes Fatigue Osteoporosis"
What are the complications of PMDD?,"""PMDD by definition is characterized by symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and activities. If untreated, these symptoms can significantly impact quality of life and a woman's ability to function at work, school, or home. Further, mood changes and ""'depression'' that may accompany PMDD can be associated with ''suicidal thoughts'' and behavior.' "
What is the prognosis for PMDD? Is there a cure?,"'Although the symptoms of PMDD can be debilitating, treatments are available that are effective in controlling symptoms for a majority of women.' "
Can PMDD be prevented?,"'Since PMDD is thought to result from interactions between ovarian hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain, there is no known way to prevent its occurrence.' "
What is PMS (premenstrual syndrome)?,"""Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, and psychological disturbances that occur after a woman's ""'ovulation'', typically ending with the onset of her menstrual flow. The most common mood-related symptoms are irritability, ''depression'', crying, oversensitivity, and mood swings. The most common physical symptoms are ''fatigue'', bloating, breast tenderness (''mastalgia''), ''acne'' flare-ups, and appetite changes with food cravings.''A more severe form of PMS, known as ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'' (''PMDD''), also known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, occurs in a smaller number of women and leads to significant loss of function because of unusually severe symptoms. The American Psychiatric Association characterizes ''PMDD'' as a severe form of PMS in which anger, irritability, and ''anxiety'' or tension are especially prominent.' "
How many women suffer from PMS?,"'About 90% of women experience premenstrual symptoms at some point in their lifetime. The true incidence of PMS has often been overestimated by including all women who experience any physical or emotional symptoms prior to ''menstruation'"". It is estimated that clinically significant PMS (which is moderate to severe in intensity and affects a woman's functioning) occurs in 20% to 30% of women. It is generally most severe in women in their 4th decade of life. About 3% to 8% of women are believed to have the condition."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of PMS?,"'A great variety of symptoms have been attributed to PMS. Women can have PMS of varying duration and severity from cycle to cycle.

How long do PMS symptoms and signs last?,"'The duration of PMS varies among women. Most women experience the symptoms for a few to several days in the week prior to the onset of their menstrual period. Some women may have symptoms for a shorter or longer time period, but symptoms of PMS typically start after ovulation (the mid-point in the monthly menstrual cycle).' "
What causes PMS?,"'PMS remains an enigma because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories have been proven, and specific ''treatment for PMS'' still largely lacks a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from the alterations in or interactions between the levels of sex hormones and brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.''PMS does not appear to be specifically associated with any personality factors or specific personality types. Likewise, a number of studies have shown that psychological ''stress'' is not related to the severity of PMS.' "
What conditions mimic PMS?,"'Some examples of medical conditions that can mimic PMS include:''The hallmark of the diagnosis of PMS is that symptom-free interval after the menstrual flow and prior to the next ovulation. If there is no such interval and the symptoms persist throughout the cycle, then PMS may not be the proper diagnosis. PMS can still be present and aggravate symptoms related to the other conditions, but it cannot be the sole cause of constant or non-cyclic symptoms. Blood or other tests may be ordered to help rule out other potential causes of symptoms.''Another way to help make the diagnosis of PMS is to prescribe drugs that stop all ovarian function. If these medications produce relief of the troublesome symptoms, then PMS is most likely the diagnosis.' Depression Cyclic water retention (idiopathic edema) Chronic fatigue Hypothyroidism Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)"
What tests diagnose PMS?,"'The most helpful diagnostic tool is the menstrual diary, which documents physical and emotional symptoms over months. If the changes occur consistently around ovulation (mid-menstrual cycle) and persist until the menstrual flow begins, then PMS is probably the accurate diagnosis. Keeping a menstrual diary not only helps the health-care professional to make the diagnosis, but also promotes a better understanding by the patient of her own body and ''moods''. Once the diagnosis of PMS is made and understood, the patient can better cope with the symptoms.''The diagnosis of PMS can be difficult because many medical and psychological conditions can mimic or worsen symptoms of PMS. There are no blood or laboratory tests to determine if a woman has PMS. When laboratory tests are performed, they are used to exclude other conditions that can mimic PMS.' "
What are the treatments for PMS?,"'The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as making the diagnosis of PMS. Various treatment approaches have been used to treat this condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women.

Often, it is a combination of ''diet'', medications and exercise that is needed to afford the maximum improvement from the many symptoms of PMS'  Diuretics: Diuretics are medications that increase the rate of urine production, thereby eliminating excess fluid from the body tissues. Several nonprescription menstrual products (including Diurex PMS, Lurline PMS, Midol PMS, Pamprin Multisymptom and Premesyn PMS) contain diuretics, and either caffeine or pamabrom. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a prescription diuretic that has been widely used to treat premenstrual swelling of the hands, feet and face. Unfortunately, it has not been effective in all patients. Pain killers (analgesics): These are commonly given for menstrual cramps, headaches, and pelvic discomfort. The most effective group of analgesics appear to be the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Benzodiazepines: The benzodiazepine alprazolam (Xanax) has been shown in some studies to relieve the depressive symptoms of PMS or PMDD.

Oral contraceptive pills containing the progestin drospirenone have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Ovarian suppressors: Drugs like danazol (Danocrine) have been prescribed to suppress ovarian hormone production. Unfortunately, Danocrine cannot be used over long periods because of side effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH): Complete suppression of ovarian function by a group of drugs called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs has been found to help some women with PMS. These GnRH analogs are not given over the long term (more than six months) because of their potential for adverse effects on bone density causing an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). In some cases these drugs may be prescribed along with hormone supplementation. Antidepressants: These are widely used in treating the mood disturbances related to PMS. Antidepressants appear to work by increasing brain chemical (opioids, serotonin, and others) levels that are affected by the ovarian hormones. These neurotransmitters are important in the control of mood and emotions. The serotonin reuptake inhibitor group of antidepressants seem to be the most effective for symptoms of PMS.

Menstrual cramps usually start shortly before the menstrual period, peak within 24 hours after their onset, and subside after a day or two.'""Menstrual cramps can range from mild to severe. Mild menstrual cramps may be barely noticeable, short-lived, and are sometimes felt only as a sense of mild pressure in the abdomen and pelvis. Severe menstrual cramps can be so painful that they interfere with a woman's regular activities for several days. The discomfort can extend to the lower back or legs. Menstrual cramps are not the same as the symptoms experienced due to ""'premenstrual'' syndrome (PMS), although the symptoms of both disorders can sometimes be experienced together. Many women suffer from both PMS and menstrual cramps.''Medical research of menstrual cramps has shown that they are often worse in women who began menstruating early and who have long menstrual periods associated with heavy menstrual flow.

What is the treatment for common menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea)?,"'Treatment options vary and each woman needs to find the treatment that works best for her. Non-drug measures that may help include adequate rest and ''sleep'', regular ''exercise'' (especially walking), and ''smoking'' cessation. Some women find that abdominal ''massage'', ''yoga'', or orgasmic sexual activity can help. A heating pad applied to the abdominal area may also relieve the ''pain''.''For mild menstrual cramps, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) aspirin and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or acetaminophen plus a diuretic (such as Diurex MPR, Midol, Pamprin, Premesyn) may help. However, aspirin has a limited effect in curbing the production of prostaglandin and is only useful for mild cramps. For moderate menstrual cramps, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful. The NSAIDs are more effective than aspirin in inhibiting the production and action of the prostaglandins. NSAIDs that are available OTC are:''For optimal control of menstrual cramps, a woman should start taking a ''NSAID'' before the onset of her ''pain'' becomes difficult to control. This might mean starting medication 1 to 2 days before the onset of her period and continuing the medication for the first 1 to 2 days of her period. The best results are obtained by taking one of the NSAIDs on a regular schedule rather than on an as needed basis. Therefore, ibuprofen should be taken every 4-6 hours, ketoprofen every 4-8 hours, and naproxen every 8-12 hours for the first few days of the menstrual flow.''Prescription NSAIDs available for the treatment of menstrual cramps include ''mefenamic acid'' (''Ponstel'').' ibuprofen (Advil, Midol IB, Motrin, Nuprin, and others); naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox); and ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)."
What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"""Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, psychological, and mood disturbances that occur after a woman's ovulation and normally end with the onset of her menstrual flow.""'PMS remains a puzzle because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories has been proven and specific treatments for PMS largely lack a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from alterations in or interactions among the levels of sex hormones and brain chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.' "
What treatments are available for PMS?,"'The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as diagnosing the condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients. General measures include:''Research studies have linked a deficiency of calcium and magnesium to PMS; therefore, it may be beneficial for woman to try ''supplements'' of these nutrients at recommended dosages. Some women have reported relief of symptoms with these ''supplements''. It is always important to follow recommended guidelines when taking vitamin supplements, since taking excess doses of some supplements may be harmful.'  Exercise: Aerobic exercise for 30 minutes 3-5 times a week improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and anxiety. Exercise also improves cardiovascular fitness and muscle tone, decreases weight and fluid retention, and improves self-esteem. Emotional support from family and friends. Stress reduction and stress management: Learning relaxation techniques, and developing coping mechanisms to reduce stress. Dietary changes: Reduce salt and refined sugar intake (too much salt and refined sugar exacerbates fluid retention). Avoid caffeine, as this may increase irritability Decrease the intake of animal fats. Avoid cigarettes and alcohol."
What medications are used to treat PMS?,"'Medications used to treat the different ''symptoms of PMS'' include taking:' Diuretics, which are medications that increase urine production, thereby eliminating excess fluid and relieving weight gain, bloating, and swelling. Ammonium chloride, caffeine, and pamabrom are mild diuretics that are ingredients in nonprescription OTC products such as Diurex PMS, Lurline PMS, Midol PMS, Pamprin Multisymptom, and Premesyn PMS. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a prescription diuretic that has been used to treat premenstrual swelling of the hands, feet, and/or face. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) that are commonly used for menstrual cramps, headaches, and pelvic discomfort. NSAIDs are available as both prescription and non-prescription products. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox), ketoprofen (Orudis), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that are sometimes prescribed by doctors to decrease fluctuations in ovarian hormone levels. While older studies failed to provide evidence that OCPs can consistently provide relief for symptoms of PMS, the newer low-dose birth control pills, with their improved hormonal formulations, seem to be more beneficial. Ovarian suppressors such as danazol (Danocrine) have been prescribed by doctors to suppress ovarian hormone production. Danocrine cannot be used over long periods because of side effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which cause the complete suppression of ovarian function, and have been found to be helpful in treating some women with PMS. These GnRH analogs are not prescribed long term (more than 6 months) because of their adverse effects on bone density and an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). Antidepressants which are prescribed by doctors to treat the mood disturbances related to PMS. Antidepressants appear to work by increasing brain chemical (serotonin and others) levels that are affected by the ovarian hormones. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil). These are examples of antidepressant medications that have been found to be effective in treating the mood changes associated with PMS."
What are some guidelines for the safe use of OTC products for menstrual cramps and PMS?," Always read the labels and know the ingredients in the products. Never take more than the recommended doses without first checking with your doctor. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause ulcers and should be avoided by patients with known peptic ulcer disease or reflux esophagitis. They can also increase the risk of bleeding and should be avoided by women with certain blood diseases. Women who are scheduled for elective surgery should inform their doctors that they are taking aspirin or NSAIDs. The doctor may ask them to withhold these medications for a period of time prior to the procedure. True aspirin allergy is rare. However, it may lead to hives, difficulty breathing, and/or shock within three hours of ingestion. Aspirin allergy is most common among individuals who have asthma, hives, or nasal polyps. Individuals with true aspirin allergy should also avoid NSAIDs because they are chemically similar to aspirin. Aspirin (and many other medications and some vitamins) can increase the anti-coagulant effect of the blood-thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin) resulting in an increased risk of bleeding. Patients taking warfarin to prevent strokes and other thrombocytic diseases should not use prescription or OTC medications for menstrual cramps or PMS without first checking with the doctor supervising their warfarin dosages. Most healthy adults tolerate aspirin and NSAIDs well, but some may develop side effects such as headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, heartburn, poor appetite, constipation, or diarrhea. Taking these drugs with food can decrease the stomach upset and heartburn. Ammonium chloride, an OTC diuretic, is an acid that can cause stomach upset in high doses. It can also cause an excess accumulation of acid (acidosis) in the blood of patients with kidney and liver disease. Caffeine is a diuretic and a stimulant. It can cause restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia. Nervousness, irritability, and nausea can occur if caffeine-containing foods and beverages are consumed concurrently. Women taking certain asthma medications such as aminophylline or theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theoair) should also avoid caffeine."
Prenatal care and tests introduction,"'Medical checkups and screening tests help keep you and your baby healthy during pregnancy. This is called prenatal care. It also involves education and counseling about how to handle different aspects of your pregnancy. During your visits, your doctor may discuss many issues, such as healthy eating and physical activity, screening tests you might need, and what to expect during ''labor and delivery''.' "
Choosing a prenatal care provider,"'You will see your prenatal care provider many times before you have your baby. So you want to be sure that the person you choose has a good reputation, and listens to and respects you. You will want to find out if the doctor or ''midwife'' can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth, such as a specific hospital or birthing center. Your provider also should be willing and able to give you the information and support you need to make an informed choice about whether to breastfeed or bottle-feed.''Health care providers that care for women during pregnancy include:''Check with your health insurance company to find out if they will cover the cost of a doula. When choosing a doula, find out if she is certified by Doulas of North America (DONA) or another professional group.''Ask your primary care doctor, friends, and family members for provider recommendations. When making your choice, think about:' Obstetricians (OB) are medical doctors who specialize in the care of pregnant women and in delivering babies. OBs also have special training in surgery so they are also able to do acesarean delivery. Women who have health problems or are at risk for pregnancy complications should see an obstetrician. Women with the highest risk pregnancies might need special care from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
 Family practice doctors are medical doctors who provide care for the whole family through all stages of life. This includes care during pregnancy and delivery, and following birth. Most family practice doctors cannot perform cesarean deliveries. A certified nurse-midwife (CNM) and certified professional midwife (CPM) are trained to provide pregnancy and postpartum care. Midwives can be a good option for healthy women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. A CNM is educated in both nursing and midwifery. Most CNMs practice in hospitals and birth centers. A CPM is required to have experience delivering babies in home settings because most CPMs practice in homes and birthing centers. All midwives should have a back-up plan with an obstetrician in case of a problem or emergency. A doula (DOO-luh) is a professional labor coach, who gives physical and emotional support to women during labor and delivery. They offer advice on breathing, relaxation, movement, and positioning. Doulas also give emotional support and comfort to women and their partners during labor and birth. Doulas and midwives often work together during a woman's labor. A recent study showed that continuous doula support during labor was linked to shorter labors and much lower use of:

Places to deliver your baby,"""Many women have strong views about where and how they'd like to deliver their babies. In general, women can choose to deliver at a hospital, birth center, or at home. You will need to contact your health insurance provider to find out what options are available. Also, find out if the doctor or midwife you are considering can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth.""'Hospitals'' are a good choice for women with health problems, pregnancy complications, or those who are at risk for problems during labor and delivery. Hospitals offer the most advanced medical equipment and highly trained doctors for ''pregnant'' women and their babies. In a hospital, doctors can do a cesarean delivery if you or your baby is in danger during labor. Women can get epidurals or many other ''pain'' relief options. Also, more and more hospitals now offer on-site birth centers, which aim to offer a style of care similar to standalone birth centers.''Questions to ask when choosing a hospital:''Birth or birthing centers'' give women a ""homey"" environment in which to labor and give birth. They try to make labor and delivery a natural and personal process by doing away with most high-tech equipment and routine procedures. So, you will not automatically be hooked up to an IV. Likewise, you won\'t have an electronic fetal monitor around your belly the whole time. Instead, the midwife or nurse will check in on your baby from time to time with a handheld machine. Once the baby is born, all exams and care will occur in your room. Usually certified nurse-midwives, not obstetricians, deliver babies at birth centers. Healthy women who are at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery may choose to deliver at a birth center.''Women cannot receive epidurals at a birth center, although some ''pain'' medicines may be available. If a cesarean delivery becomes necessary, women must be moved to a hospital for the procedure. After delivery, babies with problems can receive basic emergency care while being moved to a hospital.''Many birthing centers have showers or tubs in their rooms for laboring women. They also tend to have comforts of home like large beds and rocking chairs. In general, birth centers allow more people in the delivery room than do hospitals. ''Birth centers can be inside of hospitals, a part of a hospital or completely separate facilities. If you want to deliver at a birth center, make sure it meets the standards of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission, or the American Association of Birth Centers. Accredited birth centers must have doctors who can work at a nearby hospital in case of problems with the mom or baby. Also, make sure the birth center has the staff and set-up to support.''Homebirth'"" is an option for healthy pregnant women with no risk factors for complications during pregnancy, labor or delivery. It is also important women have a strong after-care support system at home. Some certified nurse midwives and doctors will deliver babies at home. Many health insurance companies do not cover the cost of care for homebirths. So check with your plan if you'd like to deliver at home.""""Homebirths are common in many countries in Europe. However, in the United States, planned homebirths are not supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG states that hospitals are the safest place to deliver a baby. In case of an emergency, says ACOG, a hospital's equipment and highly trained doctors can provide the best care for a woman and her baby.""'If you are thinking about a homebirth, you need to weigh the pros and cons.

Since there will be no routine medical procedures, you will have control of your experience.''The main disadvantage of a homebirth is that in case of a problem, you and the baby will not have immediate hospital/medical care. It will have to wait until you are transferred to the hospital. Plus, women who deliver at home have no options for pain relief. ''To ensure your safety and that of your baby, you must have a highly trained and experienced midwife along with a fail-safe back-up plan. You will need fast, reliable transportation to a hospital. If you live far away from a hospital, homebirth may not be the best choice.

Monitor your baby's activity,"'After 28 weeks, keep track of your baby\'s movement. This will help you to notice if your baby is moving less than normal, which could be a sign that your baby is in distress and needs a doctor\'s care. An easy way to do this is the ""count-to-10"" approach. Count your baby\'s movements in the evening — the time of day when the fetus tends to be most active. Lie down if you have trouble feeling your baby move. Most women count 10 movements within about one hour. It is rare for a woman to count less than 10 movements within two hours at times when the baby is active. Count your baby\'s movements every day so you know what is normal for you. Call your doctor if you count less than 10 movements within two hours or if you notice your baby is moving less than normal. If your baby is not moving at all, call your doctor right away.' "
Prenatal tests,"""Tests are used during pregnancy to check your and your baby's health. At your fist prenatal visit, your doctor will use tests to check for a number of things, such as:""'Throughout your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife may suggest a number of other tests, too.

The following factors may increase the risk of problems during pregnancy:''Health problems also may develop during a pregnancy that make it high-risk, such as ''gestational diabetes'' or ''preeclampsia''.''Women with high-risk pregnancies need prenatal care more often and sometimes from a specially trained doctor. A maternal-fetal medicine specialist is a medical doctor that cares for high-risk pregnancies.'""If your pregnancy is considered high risk, you might worry about your unborn baby's health and have trouble enjoying your pregnancy. Share your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor can explain your risks and the chances of a real problem. Also, be sure to follow your doctor's advice. For example, if your doctor tells you to take it easy, then ask your partner, family members, and friends to help you out in the months ahead. You will feel better knowing that you are doing all you can to care for your unborn baby.""

Paying for prenatal care,"'Pregnancy can be stressful if you are worried about affording health care for you and your unborn baby. For many women, the extra expenses of prenatal care and preparing for the new baby are overwhelming. The good news is that women in every state can get help to pay for medical care during their pregnancies. Every state in the United States has a program to help. Programs give medical care, information, advice, and other services important for a healthy pregnancy. ''To find out about the program in your state: ''You may also find help through these places:' Call 800-311-BABY (800-311-2229) – This toll-free telephone number will connect you to the Health Department in your area code.  Call 800-504-7081 for information in Spanish. Call or contact your local Health Department. Local hospital or social service agencies – Ask to speak with a social worker on staff. She or he will be able to tell you where to go for help. Community clinics – Some areas have free clinics or clinics that provide free care to women in need.

It provides help with food, nutritional counseling, and access to health services for women, infants, and children. Places of worship"
What is amniocentesis?,"'Amniocentesis is a procedure wherein a sample of fluid is removed from the amniotic sac for analysis. The amniotic sac is found within the uterine ''cavity'"". The amniotic sac is the fluid-filled structure inside a pregnant woman's uterus within which the baby lives. Fetal cells, proteins, and fetal urine freely move within this sac.""""During amniocentesis, fluid is removed by placing a long needle through the abdominal wall into amniotic sac. Sometimes, the woman's skin is injected first with a local anesthetic, but this is not usually necessary. The amniocentesis needle is typically guided into the sac with the help of ""'ultrasound'' imaging performed either prior to or during the procedure. Once the needle is in the sac, a syringe is used to withdraw the clear amber-colored amniotic fluid, that resembles urine. The volume of fluid withdrawn depends upon the age of the fetus and the reason for the procedure.''The fluid can then be sent for evaluation of fetal lung maturity, genetic evaluation, evidence of ''spina bifida'' (a birth defect in spinal cord development) or other neural-tube defects, the presence of infection, or fetal chromosomal analysis. Chromosomes are structures which contain all of the genetic information within our cells. Amniotic fluid contains numerous free-floating fetal cells that can be grown in the laboratory. When these cells multiply and reach a certain number, their chromosomes are extracted and analyzed. It takes approximately two weeks to perform chromosomal analysis. The fluid also contains proteins, ''minerals'' and other compounds that can be tested. These additional studies may require 1 to 7 days to perform. Data obtained from amniotic fluid can help women make informed decisions regarding their ''pregnancies''.''For most patients, amniocentesis is a fairly rapid and comfortable procedure. Some women experience uterine cramping after the procedure. They may also feel faint during or following the test.'  "
Who is a candidate for amniocentesis?,"'Women over the age of 35 have an increased chance of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, the current recommendation is that women who will be age 35 or older at the time of delivery be offered a genetic amniocentesis for the testing of fetal chromosomes. Chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus can lead to intellectual disabilities or other ''birth defects'', as seen with '""Down's syndrome""'. The possibility of having a baby with a chromosomal defect increases with the age of the mother.''If there is a family history of chromosomal problems or history of prior births in which a chromosomal defect was identified, amniocentesis may be recommended. However, the exact benefit of amniocentesis in these situations is uncertain. Many chromosomal defects may not reappear in subsequent pregnancies, and ''genetic counseling'' can help a woman decide whether amniocentesis would be of value in these situations.' At age 35, the chance is about 1 in 178. By age 40, the rate increases to 1 in 63. By age 48, the ratio is 1 in 8. For women younger than 35, the risk of complications as a result of amniocentesis outweighs the possibility that the baby has a chromosomal abnormality (see below, ""Is Amniocentesis Safe?""). After 35, the chance of delivering a baby with a chromosomal abnormality may be more common than experiencing the complications associated with this procedure."
What does amniocentesis show?,"'Amniocentesis is very accurate in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and the gender of the fetus. Occasionally, the fetal cells harvested by amniocentesis do not grow in the culture, and no chromosomal data can be obtained. Additionally, \xa0physician may be unable to extract fluid from the uterus during amniocentesis due to a variety of technical reasons. In both instances, a subsequent extraction of fluid may be attempted.''Amniocentesis testing for ''lung maturity'' can help the doctor make decisions regarding timing of delivery for women in premature ''labor'', those with ''diabetes'', or other medical conditions requiring possible early delivery. Lung maturity testing is not perfect. In rare instances, a baby with lungs that are predicted to perform normally can still experience difficulty ''breathing''.''The AFP (alpha fetoprotein) blood test is currently available and can be used to screen for ''neural tube defects'' such as spina bifida, as well as '""Down's syndrome"""". An elevated AFP blood level may indicate the possibility that the fetus has a defect in the brain and/or spinal cord development. A low AFP level may indicate the potential for Down's syndrome. When abnormal blood levels of AFP are found, further evaluation with ultrasound and amniocentesis can be done to look for birth defects and chromosomal abnormalities.""'Amniocentesis can also help determine if there are specific ''genetic problems present in the fetus''. Testing for Tay-Sachs disease, ''cystic fibrosis'', ''sickle cell anemia'', and other ''inherited'' disorders can be performed on samples of amniotic fluid. Checking the cells for specific genes can now be done on the fetal cell cultures. It is also possible to look for a specific protein in the amniotic fluid that can signal a genetic abnormality. Testing for genetic (inherited) diseases is not routinely performed, but is available when necessary.''Another common reason for performing amniocentesis is to determine if the fetal lungs are mature enough so that the baby can be safely delivered before the due date. If the fetal lungs are not mature, an attempt can be made to stop premature ''labor'' with medications. If the lung tissues are mature, it may be safe for the premature baby to be born. This test can also help in the timing of delivery when the due date is uncertain.''Occasionally, a pregnant woman may have a ''fever'"" without an obvious site of infection. In these instances, an amniocentesis may be performed to determine if the cause of the mother's fever is from an ""'intrauterine infection''.''The overall possibility of birth defects in any pregnancy is approximately 3%. For defects such as ''cleft lip'', ''hernia'', and extra fingers or toes,\xa0amniocentesis will not be diagnostic. Ultrasound may be helpful in detecting these defects in the fetus.' "
When should amniocentesis be performed?,"'For genetic testing, chromosome analysis, and evaluation of an abnormal AFP test, amniocentesis is usually performed between the 15th and the 21st weeks of pregnancy. There is a higher rate of ''miscarriage'' associated with amniocentesis that is performed earlier than the 15th week. There is no time limit as to how late in the pregnancy amniocentesis can be performed.''If amniocentesis is performed to determine fetal lung maturity, it is often done anywhere between the 32nd and 36th week of pregnancy. In women with ''diabetes'', lung maturity testing may be done as late as the 39th week, because poorly controlled ''diabetes'' may delay fetal lung maturity.' "
Is amniocentesis safe?,"'Overall, amniocentesis is a safe procedure with the risk of fetal loss generally less than 1%. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin, there is a procedure-related rate of fetal loss ranging from 1/300 to 1/500 procedures.''Because there is still a slight possibility of pregnancy loss from the procedure, amniocentesis should be performed only when clearly indicated and its benefits have been determined to outweigh any associated risks. Many parents ask for the procedure to ""reassure"" themselves that everything is perfect. It should be emphasized that an amniocentesis with normal results does not guarantee that the baby will not have a birth or genetic defect. Many birth defects cannot be detected by amniocentesis. Besides fetal loss, other risks associated with amniocentesis include bleeding, cramping and leakage of fluid from the amniotic sac. These problems occur in about 1% of women undergoing the procedure, and they generally resolve on their own. If these symptoms arise following the procedure, the woman is often advised to stop work and remain at bed rest until the symptoms cease. Subsequently activity may be restricted by the doctor. Occasionally, the needle enters the fetus during an amniocentesis. This is generally harmless, but the infant should be monitored for a short time following the testing.''Amniocentesis is a relatively safe and painless procedure that can provide helpful information. The procedure can be offered to selected women after reviewing the anticipated risks and benefits involved.' "
Prenatal care and tests introduction,"'Medical checkups and screening tests help keep you and your baby healthy during pregnancy. This is called prenatal care. It also involves education and counseling about how to handle different aspects of your pregnancy. During your visits, your doctor may discuss many issues, such as healthy eating and physical activity, screening tests you might need, and what to expect during ''labor and delivery''.' "
Choosing a prenatal care provider,"'You will see your prenatal care provider many times before you have your baby. So you want to be sure that the person you choose has a good reputation, and listens to and respects you. You will want to find out if the doctor or ''midwife'' can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth, such as a specific hospital or birthing center. Your provider also should be willing and able to give you the information and support you need to make an informed choice about whether to breastfeed or bottle-feed.''Health care providers that care for women during pregnancy include:''Check with your health insurance company to find out if they will cover the cost of a doula. When choosing a doula, find out if she is certified by Doulas of North America (DONA) or another professional group.''Ask your primary care doctor, friends, and family members for provider recommendations. When making your choice, think about:' Obstetricians (OB) are medical doctors who specialize in the care of pregnant women and in delivering babies. OBs also have special training in surgery so they are also able to do acesarean delivery. Women who have health problems or are at risk for pregnancy complications should see an obstetrician. Women with the highest risk pregnancies might need special care from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
 Family practice doctors are medical doctors who provide care for the whole family through all stages of life. This includes care during pregnancy and delivery, and following birth. Most family practice doctors cannot perform cesarean deliveries. A certified nurse-midwife (CNM) and certified professional midwife (CPM) are trained to provide pregnancy and postpartum care. Midwives can be a good option for healthy women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. A CNM is educated in both nursing and midwifery. Most CNMs practice in hospitals and birth centers. A CPM is required to have experience delivering babies in home settings because most CPMs practice in homes and birthing centers. All midwives should have a back-up plan with an obstetrician in case of a problem or emergency. A doula (DOO-luh) is a professional labor coach, who gives physical and emotional support to women during labor and delivery. They offer advice on breathing, relaxation, movement, and positioning. Doulas also give emotional support and comfort to women and their partners during labor and birth. Doulas and midwives often work together during a woman's labor. A recent study showed that continuous doula support during labor was linked to shorter labors and much lower use of:

Places to deliver your baby,"""Many women have strong views about where and how they'd like to deliver their babies. In general, women can choose to deliver at a hospital, birth center, or at home. You will need to contact your health insurance provider to find out what options are available. Also, find out if the doctor or midwife you are considering can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth.""'Hospitals'' are a good choice for women with health problems, pregnancy complications, or those who are at risk for problems during labor and delivery. Hospitals offer the most advanced medical equipment and highly trained doctors for ''pregnant'' women and their babies. In a hospital, doctors can do a cesarean delivery if you or your baby is in danger during labor. Women can get epidurals or many other ''pain'' relief options. Also, more and more hospitals now offer on-site birth centers, which aim to offer a style of care similar to standalone birth centers.''Questions to ask when choosing a hospital:''Birth or birthing centers'' give women a ""homey"" environment in which to labor and give birth. They try to make labor and delivery a natural and personal process by doing away with most high-tech equipment and routine procedures. So, you will not automatically be hooked up to an IV. Likewise, you won\'t have an electronic fetal monitor around your belly the whole time. Instead, the midwife or nurse will check in on your baby from time to time with a handheld machine. Once the baby is born, all exams and care will occur in your room. Usually certified nurse-midwives, not obstetricians, deliver babies at birth centers. Healthy women who are at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery may choose to deliver at a birth center.''Women cannot receive epidurals at a birth center, although some ''pain'' medicines may be available. If a cesarean delivery becomes necessary, women must be moved to a hospital for the procedure. After delivery, babies with problems can receive basic emergency care while being moved to a hospital.''Many birthing centers have showers or tubs in their rooms for laboring women. They also tend to have comforts of home like large beds and rocking chairs. In general, birth centers allow more people in the delivery room than do hospitals. ''Birth centers can be inside of hospitals, a part of a hospital or completely separate facilities. If you want to deliver at a birth center, make sure it meets the standards of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission, or the American Association of Birth Centers. Accredited birth centers must have doctors who can work at a nearby hospital in case of problems with the mom or baby. Also, make sure the birth center has the staff and set-up to support.''Homebirth'"" is an option for healthy pregnant women with no risk factors for complications during pregnancy, labor or delivery. It is also important women have a strong after-care support system at home. Some certified nurse midwives and doctors will deliver babies at home. Many health insurance companies do not cover the cost of care for homebirths. So check with your plan if you'd like to deliver at home.""""Homebirths are common in many countries in Europe. However, in the United States, planned homebirths are not supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG states that hospitals are the safest place to deliver a baby. In case of an emergency, says ACOG, a hospital's equipment and highly trained doctors can provide the best care for a woman and her baby.""'If you are thinking about a homebirth, you need to weigh the pros and cons. The main advantage is that you will be able to experience labor and delivery in the privacy and comfort of your own home. Since there will be no routine medical procedures, you will have control of your experience.''The main disadvantage of a homebirth is that in case of a problem, you and the baby will not have immediate hospital/medical care. It will have to wait until you are transferred to the hospital. Plus, women who deliver at home have no options for pain relief. ''To ensure your safety and that of your baby, you must have a highly trained and experienced midwife along with a fail-safe back-up plan. You will need fast, reliable transportation to a hospital. If you live far away from a hospital, homebirth may not be the best choice. Your midwife must be experienced and have the necessary skills and supplies to start emergency care for you and your baby if need be. Your midwife should also have access to a doctor 24 hours a day.' Is it close to your home?  Is a doctor who can give pain relief, such as an epidural, at the hospital 24-hours a day? 
	 Do you like the feel of the labor and delivery rooms?  Are private rooms available?  How many support people can you invite into the room with you?  Does it have a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in case of serious problems with the baby?

	breastfeeding?

Prenatal checkups,"'During pregnancy, regular checkups are very important. This consistent care can help keep you and your baby healthy, spot problems if they occur, and prevent problems during delivery. Typically, routine checkups occur:''Women with high-risk pregnancies need to see their doctors more often.''At your first visit your doctor will perform a full physical exam, take your blood for lab tests, and calculate your due date. Your doctor might also do a breast exam, a ''pelvic exam'' to check your uterus (womb), and a cervical exam, including a ''Pap test'"". During this first visit, your doctor will ask you lots of questions about your lifestyle, relationships, and health habits. It's important to be honest with your doctor.""'After the first visit, most prenatal visits will include:''You also will have some routine tests throughout your pregnancy, such as tests to look foranemia, tests to measure risk of gestational ''diabetes'', and tests to look for harmful infections.''Become a partner with your doctor to manage your care. Keep all of your appointments — every one is important! Ask questions and read to educate yourself about this exciting time.' Once each month for weeks four through 28 Twice a month for weeks 28 through 36 Weekly for weeks 36 to birth Checking your blood pressure and weight Checking the baby's heart rate Measuring your abdomen to check your baby's growth"
Monitor your baby's activity,"'After 28 weeks, keep track of your baby\'s movement. This will help you to notice if your baby is moving less than normal, which could be a sign that your baby is in distress and needs a doctor\'s care. An easy way to do this is the ""count-to-10"" approach. Count your baby\'s movements in the evening — the time of day when the fetus tends to be most active. Lie down if you have trouble feeling your baby move. Most women count 10 movements within about one hour. It is rare for a woman to count less than 10 movements within two hours at times when the baby is active. Count your baby\'s movements every day so you know what is normal for you. Call your doctor if you count less than 10 movements within two hours or if you notice your baby is moving less than normal. If your baby is not moving at all, call your doctor right away.' "
Prenatal tests,"""Tests are used during pregnancy to check your and your baby's health. At your fist prenatal visit, your doctor will use tests to check for a number of things, such as:""'Throughout your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife may suggest a number of other tests, too. Some tests are suggested for all women, such as screenings for gestational ''diabetes'', ''Down syndrome'', and ''HIV''. Other tests might be offered based on your:''Some tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of ''possible'' health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results, your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. ''The following chart describes some of the most common prenatal tests:'""If your doctor suggests certain prenatal tests, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. Learning about the test, why your doctor is suggesting it for you, and what the test results could mean can help you cope with any worries or fears you might have. Keep in mind that screening tests do not diagnose problems. They evaluate risk. So if a screening test comes back abnormal, this doesn't mean there is a problem with your baby.

What is prenatal ultrasound?,"'Like other ''ultrasound'' examinations, ''prenatal'' or fetal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac in a ''pregnant'' woman. The test does not involve ''radiation'' and is completely safe for both mother and baby. An ultrasound examination is also known as a ''sonogram''. The entire procedure can be performed in 30 minutes or less.\xa0Two types of ultrasound exams are used in ''pregnancy''.''Two types of ultrasound exams are used in pregnancy. The most common is a transabdominal ultrasound, in which the measuring instrument (transducer) is moved over the surface of the abdomen after a gel has been applied. Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is no ''pain'"" or discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.""""Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination. This type of exam is most commonly used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out suspected problems or to assess the gestational age of the embryo. In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.""  Transabdominal ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound"
Why is prenatal ultrasound performed?,"'As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Major ''birth defects'' can be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.''Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:' Determination of multiple gestation Ensuring the health of the baby and 
monitoring its growth Determining the location of the 
placenta Estimation of gestational age and due 
date Assessing the expected size and weight 
of the baby Determining the amount of amniotic 
fluid Determining the position of the baby"
What are 3D and 4D ultrasound?,"'A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations. Medical authorities, including The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug Administration do not recommend using these services because the examiners may not have received proper training and could provide inaccurate information.' "
Are there risks associated with prenatal ultrasound?,"'As mentioned before, there is no radiation exposure during a prenatal ultrasound. Ultrasound exams have been used for many years, and studies have never shown any harms associated with the procedure, either on a short- or long-term basis.' "
What is the operation (procedure) that is recommended?,"'Ask your surgeon for a simplified explanation of the type of operation, technique used, and reasons it should be performed. (Pictures and drawings can tell patients and family a great deal.) Why was this specific procedure chosen over possible alternatives?' "
What is the surgeon's experience with this procedure?,"'It is reasonable to ask how often the surgeon performs the particular procedure. Ask the surgeon about his/her experience with this procedure, its outcome, and the hospital or setting in which the operation will be performed. Is the ''nursing'' staff accustomed to caring for patients who have had this procedure?'  "
What is the reason that this procedure is necessary at this time?,"'Is the procedure being done to relieve ''pain'', diagnose a condition, correct deformity, for cosmetic reasons, or what exact purposes? Must the procedure be performed immediately?' "
What are the options if this procedure is not done?,"'What are the nonsurgical or medical treatments available to help the condition? What will/might happen if the operation is not done? If the operation is not done at this time, can it be done later? What are the consequences if the procedure is postponed or delayed?' "
What is the anticipated outcome of the procedure?,'What exactly are the expected or possible benefits of doing the procedure? How likely is it that these benefits will result from the procedure?' 
Where will the doctor perform the surgery?,"'Surgical procedures may be performed in a hospital operating room or in an outpatient surgical facility, which may be located in a hospital or sometimes in medical offices.' "
What kind of anesthesia is required for the procedure?,'Is a general anesthetic necessary? Can the procedure be performed under local or regional anesthesia? Are ''sedatives'' or other medications required prior to the procedure? What are the risks of the type of anesthesia to be used?' 
What are the specific risks that this procedure involves?,"'What are the problems, complications, or conditions that are the risks of the procedure? How common are these complications and potential adverse events? If complications occur, how can they be treated? Is hospitalization required, or can the procedure be performed on an outpatient basis? If hospitalization is recommended, how long is a typical hospital stay?' "
What about a second opinion?,"'Obtaining a second opinion is very reasonable for an elective (voluntary, or non-emergency) surgical procedure. This will not be a problem with the first surgeon, who will recognize this as commonplace. Second opinions can reassure anxious patients (and family members) and make the whole process easier for all involved.' "
What is the recovery process after this procedure?,'Procedures vary in terms of ''wound'' recovery time and length of rehabilitation programs. It is very important for patients to know the long-term program ahead of time for the best planning. Will ''pain'' control medications be necessary? How long will it be until you can resume normal functioning? When can you return to work and recreational activities?' 
Is this procedure covered by my insurance plan?,"""Will physician's fees, associated costs, hospital services, rehabilitation programs, and pain medications be covered by my insurance plan? Sometimes the doctor's office staff can be very helpful in securing the answers to these questions. If not, a direct call to your insurer is in order."" "
Introduction,"'Presbyopia'' is part of the natural ''aging'"" process of the eye, and can be easily corrected. Technically, presbyopia is the loss of the eye's ability to change its focus to see objects that are near. It is not a disease. It's as natural as  ""'wrinkles'', and it affects everybody at some point in life. Presbyopia generally starts to appear around age 45.''Presbyopia is often confused with ''farsightedness'"" , but the two are different. Presbyopia occurs when the eye's ""'lens'' loses flexibility. ''Farsightedness'' occurs as a result of the shape of the eyeball, which causes light rays to bend incorrectly once they have entered the eye.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Presbyopia?,'Symptoms of presbyopia include:'  Blurred vision at a normal reading distance The need to hold reading material at arm's length Headaches from doing close work
How Is Presbyopia Diagnosed?,'An eye doctor can diagnose presbyopia by performing a thorough eye exam.' 
How Is Presbyopia Treated?,"'Presbyopia cannot be cured. Instead, prescription glasses, contact lens, reading glasses, progressive addition lenses, or bifocals can help correct the effects of presbyopia. Bifocals are often prescribed for presbyopia. Bifocals are ''eyeglasses'' that have two different prescriptions in one spectacle lens. The main part of the lens contains a prescription for ''nearsightedness'' or ''farsightedness'', while the lower portion of the lens holds a stronger prescription to help a person see objects up-close. Progressive addition lenses are similar to bifocals but have a more gradual transition between the two prescriptions.''Contact lenses'' used to treat presbyopia include multifocal lenses, which come in soft or ''gas'' permeable versions, and monovision lens, in which one eye wears a lens that aids in seeing objects at a distance, while the other has a lens that aids in near vision.''Laser surgery to reverse presbyopia is currently being used in Canada and Mexico. However, it is still being investigated in the U.S., and has not yet been approved by the FDA to treat presbyopia.''The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a surgical procedure called conductive keratoplasty to treat presbyopia. Instead of lasers, conductive keratoplasty uses radio waves. The physician uses a small instrument to apply the radio waves to the eye (usually just one eye) to reshape the ''cornea'"" and improve the patient's vision of nearby objects.""'Talk to your doctor to find out which treatment is best for you.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.'

Maintaining health,"'The body requires carbohydrates, ''fats'', proteins, ''vitamins'', and ''minerals'' to maintain healthy organs, bones, muscles, and nerves, and to produce hormones and chemicals that are necessary for the proper function of organs.''Vitamins'' and minerals are naturally occurring substances that are essential for the growth and function of the body. Vitamins and minerals are both necessary (in small amounts) for normal chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body.' "
Preventing and controlling diseases,"'Obesity and ''heart attacks'' are major public-health problems in the United States and other countries. Therefore, most dietary recommendations are aimed at preventing these two diseases. Obesity comes over time by eating more calories than the body ''burns''. Obesity, in turn, can contribute to the development of many diseases such as ''heart disease'', ''diabetes'',  ''sleep apnea'', ''liver disease'', ''arthritis'', ''high blood pressure'', ''gout'', ''gallstones'', and certain cancers.''To ''lose weight'' or maintain a healthy weight, it helps to eat more low-energy-dense foods. Low-energy-dense foods (such as vegetables and fruits) contain few calories per unit volume of food so that one can eat a large volume of it (for example, lettuce) without taking in many calories. One should also eat less of the high-energy-dense foods such as fats, egg yolks, fried foods, sweets, and high-fat salad dressings. Foods with a high energy density also often have ''high cholesterol'' and saturated fat content. One should also eat less of those foods that provide calories but little other nutrients, such as ''alcohol'' and many packaged snack foods.''The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, published in 2010 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), contains guidelines for healthy diets based upon review of scientific studies for people above 2 years of age. These guidelines recommend that a healthy ''diet'' should:''MyPyramid'"" is an online animated program to help a person customize his/her diet by choosing proper foods and portion sizes based on the individual's age, sex, and activity level. The key objectives of the MyPyramid Plan are to help a person get the most ""'nutrition'' (proteins, vitamins, and minerals) out of the recommended number of daily calories and to achieve a balance between food intake and physical activity to maintain a healthy weight. The MyPyramid Plan recommendations include:' balance calories with physical activity to manage weight; consume more of certain foods and nutrients such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and seafood; consume fewer foods with sodium (salt), saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, and refined grains. Make half your grains whole. Vary your veggies. Focus on fruit. Get your calcium-rich foods. Go lean with protein. Find your balance between food and physical activity."
Vitamins and minerals to maintain health,"'Vitamins and mineral ''supplements'' are important both in preventing deficiency states as well as in preventing diseases. Most diseases resulting from vitamin deficiencies such as ''scurvy'' (''vitamin C'' deficiency), night\xa0''blindness'' (''vitamin A'' deficiency), and beriberi (''thiamine'' deficiency) occur mainly in third-world countries and are almost nonexistent in the United States. But certain special populations in the United States can develop vitamin or mineral deficiencies, and thus require ''dietary supplements''. For example,''For these special populations, vitamin ''supplements'' are important to prevent these deficiencies.'   severely malnourished alcoholics can develop nerve damage from thiamine deficiency;  individuals lacking sun exposure can develop bone disease from vitamin D deficiency; pernicious anemia is a condition associated with nerve damage, which can result from vitamin B12 deficiency; and people with celiac sprue can also develop vitamin deficiencies, as well as iron deficiency."
Vitamin supplements to prevent diseases,"'Vitamin supplements are used to prevent deficiencies and also to prevent diseases. Certain vitamin supplements (such as ''folic acid'', vitamin B6, and B12) have been used to lower blood levels of ''homocysteine'', which may help prevent ''heart attacks''. Folic acid fortification in cereals and vitamin supplements has been found to decrease the risk of ''birth defects'' in the developing fetus in ''pregnant'' women.' "
Diets to control and/or treat diseases,"'Diets low in simple sugars are important in controlling blood glucose levels in people with ''diabetes'' mellitus. When the condition cannot be adequately controlled by diet alone, medications (sometimes including ''insulin'') are required.'   The DASH diet is recommended to lower blood pressure. If dietary measures alone are not sufficient, medications are frequently prescribed by doctors (sometimes in combination) to lower blood pressure. A gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease (celiac sprue). Since people with celiac sprue may have difficulty absorbing nutrients and vitamins, some people with this condition may also need calcium, iron, and vitamin supplements. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are important treatments for high blood levels of cholesterol, especially the ""bad"" ( LDL) cholesterol. When TLC are not sufficient, then medications are usually indicated to lower blood lipid levels."
What is a heart attack?,"'A heart attack happens when the flow of blood that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is significantly reduced or cut off completely. This is often a result of ''atherosclerosis'', a process whereby the arteries narrow due to a buildup of plaque (fat, ''cholesterol'', and other substances). Sometimes these plaques can break off, and ''blood clots'' can form around them. The clots in the coronary arteries then block blood flow to the heart, starving it of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia), causing damage or death to heart muscle. This damage to the heart muscle is a heart attack. Heart attack is medically termed myocardial infarction (MI).' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a heart attack in men and women?,"'Sometimes people having a heart attack experience no symptoms at all.

What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome (''IBS'') is a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal (mainly the ''large intestine'' or colon) disorder with signs and symptoms that may include:''IBS'' is a chronic condition that can be triggered by ''diet'', medications and/or by other conditions such as ''stress''.''Some health care professionals categorize and term ''IBS'' into one of four categories:''Not all health care professionals recognize these four categories.' Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Mucus in the stool Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation) IBS-D (predominant symptoms is diarrhea) IBS-C (predominant symptoms is constipation) IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) IBS-U (unclassified)"
Are stress and anxiety triggers for IBS?,"'Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may be triggers for IBS and the development of recurrent symptoms. Chronic stress experienced early in life (less than age 18) may increase the chances of developing the condition. Moreover, people diagnosed with IBS can have stress or ''anxiety'' trigger symptoms, such as:'   Diarrhea Constipation Abdominal bloating Mucus defecation Feelings of incomplete bowel movements"
Are menstrual pain and IBS related?,"'Some studies show that many women with IBS have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods. Although the mechanism is not clear, some gastrointestinal cells have receptors for estrogen and ''progesterone'' so that changes in the hormone levels during the ''menstrual cycle'' may trigger increasing ''IBS symptoms''. Women are twice as likely to develop IBS as men.' "
What foods in the diet trigger constipation in IBS?,"'Any foods or fluids that tend to dehydrate a person are likely to trigger ''constipation'' in people with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome. Foods that may promote constipation should be avoided in an IBS ''diet'' and include:''Foods that help prevent constipation and should be included in an IBS ''diet'' include:'   Chocolate Dairy products such as milk and cheese (particularly those that contain lactose) Red meat Unripe bananas Items that contain caffeine if you are slightly dehydrated. Coffee, carbonated drinks and alcohol may lead to dehydration and constipation in IBS patients (and other people, too). Prunes Various types of beans Whole grain breads like rye bread Pears and fruits like kiwi Vegetables that will help boost fiber intake"
What foods in the diet trigger diarrhea in IBS?,"   Several foods may play a role in developing diarrhea in people with IBS. Major categories of foods that may trigger IBS are those that contain fats (fatty meats, fatty dairy products, for example). Each individual is slightly different and may respond differently to food types. Consequently, dietitians and health care professionals who treat people with IBS often suggest that they keep a journal or diary to track those foods that cause diarrhea. Some foods that trigger diarrhea do so because they are ingested in large quantities; for example, a bite of a banana may not cause diarrhea, but eating a whole banana may trigger diarrhea in some people with IBS. Other foods that contain high levels of fructose, artificial sweeteners, high FODMAP foods, and fried foods may also trigger diarrhea. Broccoli, onions, cabbage and large helpings of beans may produce gas and increase the discomfort of diarrhea. Probiotics may help reduce the symptoms of diarrhea and gas in some individuals."
What prescription or OTC drugs trigger IBS?,"'Some ''drugs'' can trigger ''IBS symptoms'' resulting in colonic spasms, constipation and/or diarrhea. Such drugs include antibiotics (especially those administered over a long period of time), ''tricyclic antidepressants'', for example, ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''doxepin'', and medicines containing ''sorbitol'' (for example, some ''cough'' syrup preparations and common ''pain'' medicines like ''Advil'' gel capsules). Consequently, patients with the condition should check the ingredients, both active and inactive, for the presence of sorbitol as sorbitol is often listed as an ""inactive"" ingredient.' "
What are the other IBS triggers?,"'Other triggers of IBS are variable and differ from person to person. However, some other common triggers include:''Keep a journal and record the symptoms and the activities you are doing when symptoms develop. This can help you determine your personal triggers for any symptoms. Researchers also suggest that changes in hormone levels and/or other acute illnesses such as infectious diarrhea may also trigger symptoms.'""Although a patient's primary care physician may care for IBS patients, specialists in gastroenterology, immunology, psychiatry and dietary professionals may be consulted to help patients manage the condition.""   Lack of exercise Eating foods too quickly Eating while under some other stress such as driving or working Eating foods that are very hot or cold Chewing gum"
How can I prevent IBS triggers?,"'There are many different ways to help prevent triggering IBS symptoms such as:' Eat a balanced diet with a moderate amount of fiber. Avoid extremes of food temperatures (very hot or cold foods). Do not eat while experiencing anxiety or under stressful conditions (for example, while working or driving). Avoid foods and drinks that may cause dehydration or diarrhea. Keep a journal to help identify those foods that do or do not trigger symptoms. Try biofeedback, exercise, meditation, or yoga to reduce anxiety. Discuss medications you are taking that may be triggering symptoms with your doctor. Avoid those foods and drinks that are likely to increase or trigger symptoms. Avoid foods that increase intestinal gas (some legumes and vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts). Talk to your doctor or health care professional about taking probiotics."

Pregnancy and influenza vaccine safety,'Influenza'' (flu) vaccine safety studies are reporting good news for pregnant women. This research was presented at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in October 2011.' 
Influenza vaccination during pregnancy protects newborns from getting influenza.,'Pregnant women who get ''influenza'' vaccine pass their immunity to their babies in the form of flu antibodies. This protection lasts for several months after birth. Influenza protection was seen in newborns up to four months old. Babies born to women who were not vaccinated during pregnancy showed no antibody protection.' 
Influenza vaccination does not cause miscarriage.,'Research shows no association between flu vaccination during pregnancy and miscarriage. This largest study conducted during the ''first trimester'' showed pregnant women who got the flu vaccine were no more likely to miscarry than those who did not get the flu vaccine.' 
More pregnant women are getting vaccinated against influenza.,"'The number of pregnant women receiving influenza vaccine has increased dramatically in the last couple of years in large part due to a national effort to vaccinate against the 2009 ''H1N1'' pandemic influenza during the 2009-10 influenza season. Prior to 2009, less than 15 percent of pregnant women got vaccinated. In the past two influenza seasons, over half of pregnant women were vaccinated.' "
"What is preventive mastectomy, and what types of procedures are used in preventive mastectomy?","'Preventive mastectomy (also called prophylactic or risk-reducing mastectomy ) is the surgical removal of one or both breasts in an effort to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer. Preventive mastectomy involves one of two basic procedures: total mastectomy and subcutaneous mastectomy. In a total mastectomy, the doctor removes the entire breast and ''nipple''. In a subcutaneous mastectomy, the doctor removes the breast tissue but leaves the nipple intact. Doctors most often recommend a total mastectomy because it removes more tissue than a subcutaneous mastectomy. A total mastectomy provides the greatest protection against cancer developing in any remaining breast tissue. ' "
Why would a woman consider undergoing preventive mastectomy?,"""Women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer may consider preventive mastectomy as a way of decreasing their risk of this disease. Some of the factors that increase a woman's chance of developing breast cancer include the following: """"It is important for a woman who is considering preventive mastectomy to talk with a doctor about her risk of developing breast cancer (with or without a mastectomy), the surgical procedure, and potential complications. All women are different, so preventive mastectomy should be considered in the context of each woman's unique risk factors and her level of concern. "" Previous breast cancer -- A woman who has had cancer in one breast is more likely to develop a new cancer in the opposite breast. Occasionally, such women may consider preventive mastectomy to decrease the chance of developing a new breast cancer. Family history of breast cancer -- Preventive mastectomy may be an option for a woman whose mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer, especially if they were diagnosed before age 50. If multiple family members have breast or ovarian cancer, then a woman's risk of breast cancer may be even higher. Breast cancer-causing gene alteration - A woman who tests positive for changes, or mutations, in certain genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) may consider preventive mastectomy. Lobular carcinoma in situ - Preventive mastectomy is sometimes considered for a woman with lobular carcinoma in situ, a condition that increases the risk of developing breast cancer in either breast. Diffuse and indeterminate breast microcalcifications or dense breasts - Rarely, preventive mastectomy may be considered for a woman who has diffuse and indeterminate breast microcalcifications (tiny deposits of calcium in the breast) or for a woman whose breast tissue is very dense. Dense breast tissue is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and also makes diagnosing breast abnormalities difficult. Multiple biopsies, which may be necessary for diagnosing abnormalities in dense breasts, cause scarring and further complicate examination of the breast tissue, by both physical examination and mammography. Radiation therapy - A woman who had radiation therapy to the chest (including the breasts) before age 30 is at an increased risk of developing breast cancer throughout her life. This includes women treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma."
How effective is preventive mastectomy in preventing or reducing the risk of breast cancer?,"'Existing data suggest that preventive mastectomy may significantly reduce (by about 90 percent) the chance of developing breast cancer in moderate- and high-risk women. However, no one can be certain that this procedure will protect an individual woman from breast cancer. Breast tissue is widely distributed on the chest wall, and can sometimes be found in the armpit, above the collarbone, and as far down as the abdomen. Because it is impossible for a surgeon to remove all breast tissue, breast cancer can still develop in the small amount of remaining tissue ' "
What are the possible drawbacks of preventive mastectomy?,"'Like any other surgery, complications such as bleeding or infection can occur. Preventive mastectomy is irreversible and can have psychological effects on a woman due to a change in ''body image'' and loss of normal breast functions. A woman should discuss her feelings about mastectomy, as well as alternatives to surgery, with her health care providers. Some women obtain a second medical opinion to help with the decision. ' "
What alternatives to surgery exist for preventing or reducing the risk of breast cancer?,"'Doctors do not always agree on the most effective way to manage the care of women who have a strong family history of breast cancer and/or have other risk factors for the disease. Some doctors may advise very close monitoring (periodic mammograms, regular checkups that include a clinical breast examination performed by a health care professional, and monthly breast self-examinations) to increase the chance of detecting breast cancer at an early stage. Some doctors may recommend preventive mastectomy, while others may prescribe tamoxifen or ''raloxifene'"", medications that have been shown to decrease the chances of getting breast cancer in women at high risk of the disease. (More information about tamoxifen and raloxifene is available in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) fact sheets, Tamoxifen: Questions and Answers, which can be found at ""'http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/tamoxifen'' on the Internet, and The Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR): Questions and Answers, which can be found at ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsQandA'' on the Internet.) ''Doctors may also encourage women at high risk to limit their consumption of ''alcohol'', eat a low-fat ''diet'', engage in regular ''exercise'', and avoid menopausal hormone use. Although these lifestyle recommendations make sense and are part of an overall healthy way of living, we do not yet have clear and convincing proof that they specifically reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. ' "
What is breast reconstruction?,"'Breast reconstruction is a ''plastic'' surgery procedure in which the shape of the breast is rebuilt. Many women who choose to have preventive mastectomy also decide to have breast reconstruction, either at the time of the mastectomy or at some later time. ''Before performing breast reconstruction, the ''plastic surgeon'"" carefully examines the breasts and discusses the reconstruction options. In one type of reconstructive procedure, the surgeon inserts an implant (a balloon-like device filled with saline or silicone) under the skin and the chest muscles. Another procedure, called tissue flap reconstruction, uses skin, fat, and muscle from the woman's abdomen, back, or buttocks to create the breast shape. The surgeon will discuss with the patient any limitations on exercise or arm motion that might result from these operations. "" "
What type of follow-up care is needed after reconstructive surgery?,"'Women who have reconstructive surgery are monitored carefully to detect and treat complications, such as infection, movement of the implant, or contracture (the formation of a firm, fibrous shell or ''scar tissue'"" around the implant caused by the body's reaction to the implant). Women who have tissue flap reconstruction may want to ask their surgeon about physical therapy, which can help them adjust to limitations in activity and exercise after surgery. Routine screening for breast cancer is also part of the postoperative follow-up, because the risk of cancer cannot be completely eliminated. When women with ""'breast implants'' have mammograms, they should tell the radiology technician about the implant. Special procedures may be necessary to improve the accuracy of the ''mammogram'' and to avoid damaging the implant. However, women who have had reconstructive surgery on both breasts should ask their doctors whether mammograms are still necessary. (More information about mammograms can be found in the NCI fact sheet, Screening Mammograms: Questions and Answers, at ''http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/screening-mammograms'' on the Internet.)

What causes priapism?,"'A normal erection occurs in response to sexual stimulation. Priapism occurs in several conditions that interfere with the blood flow to the penis or blood drainage from the penis. This condition is unrelated to sexual stimulation and can last for several hours. Below are some of the causes of priapism.''Medical conditions that can cause priapism:''Trauma'' as a cause of priapism:''Medications (several ''drugs'' have priapism as a side effect):'   Sickle cell disease (most common reason for priapism) Leukemia History of malignancy (cancer) Direct trauma to the penis, pelvis, or perineum Spinal cord injuries Antidepressants Antipsychotics Blood thinners (warfarin [Coumadin] and heparin) Medications to help with erectile dysfunction (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Caverject) Illegal drugs ( cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, crystal meth, cannabis)"
What are the symptoms of priapism?,"'Priapism results in a persistent erection. Priapism is usually divided into three categories.'  Ischemic priapism is the most common category of priapism. Blood is not able to leave the penis causing the erection. This painful event is considered an emergency if it lasts for more than 4 hours. Non-ischemic (high-flow) priapism is the second category of priapism, and much less common. In this form, too much blood flows into the penis. The erection tends to be painless and less rigid then the ischemic form. Suttering priapism is the third category of priapism. In stuttering priapism, the erection occurs repeatedly but is transient in nature."
How is priapism diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of priapism is based on history (asking the patient questions) and the physical exam of the genitalia. Once a health care professional has finished this part of the exam a few other tests might be ordered.' Measurement of blood gas: By inserting a small needle and removing blood from 
	the penis the doctor will be able to establish the oxygen content and therefore 
the type of priapism the patient has. Blood tests: Measuring white and red blood cells and platelets will help 
the health care professional determine why the patient might have a priapism."
What is the treatment for priapism?,"'The treatment of ischemic priapism includes several modalities and will depend on how long the priapism has been present, and the results of the blood tests. These interventions are performed in a step wise fashion with surgery being the last resort. Unfortunately, some of the treatments of priapism can lead to ''erectile dysfunction'' in the future.''Treatments for priapism are as follows:''Ice to the area around the genitals is sometime utilized. In severe cases surgical procedures are available.''Non-ischemic priapism is usually not an emergency and will frequently resolve without interventions.'   Aspiration: Blood is drained from the penis using a 16 or 18 gauge needle and syringe. Medication: A medication that constricts blood vessels that carry blood into the penis (Alpha Adrenergic Sympathomimetic; phenylephrine) is injected into the penis using a small (29 gauge) needle into the corpora cavernosa area of the penis. Surgery: A surgical procedure that reroutes blood can be performed."
What are the complications of priapism?,"'Ischemic priapism can cause significant complications. Due to the lack of oxygen, there can be significant damage if priapism lasts for more than four hours. The complications include ''erectile dysfunction'' as well as disfigurement of the penis.' "
When to see a health care professional,"""A painful erection lasting for more than 4 hours should trigger an emergency department visit. If the unwanted erection resolves in less than four hours a nonemergent doctor's visit should be scheduled."" "
Can priapism be prevented?,'Priapism or recurrence of priapism can be prevented by treating the underlying medical cause that resulted in priapism or changing medications that have priapism as their side effects. No medications should be discontinued or changed until you speak with your healthcare provider.' 
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) definition,"'Primary biliary ''cirrhosis'' (PBC) is a progressive disease of the ''liver'' caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (''cholestasis'') that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. Over time, this pressure build-up destroys the bile ducts leading to liver cell damage. As the disease progresses and enough liver cells die, ''cirrhosis'' and liver failure occur.''Bile is manufactured in the liver and then transported through the bile ducts to the gallbladder and intestine where it helps digest ''fats'' and fat soluble ''vitamins'' (A,D,E,K). When bile cannot be drained from the liver, it causes inflammation that leads to cell death. ''Scar tissue'' gradually replaces the areas of damaged liver and then the body cannot perform necessary functions.'  "
What are the causes of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"""The cause of PBC is unknown. It is most likely an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system attacks its own cells. In this disease, the bile ducts are under attack and are destroyed."" "
What are the risk factors for primary biliary cirrhosis?," There may be a 
	genetic component to the development of PBC since a 
	person 
with the disease is likely to have a family member also afflicted. Women are nine times more likely than men to develop PBC. It most often 
develops in the middle age between the ages of 40 to 60. The disease is seen more often in white, northern Europeans, compared 
to African-Americans."
What are the signs and symptoms for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'Up to a quarter of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis are asymptomatic, meaning they do not have symptoms at the time of diagnosis and the disease is found incidentally because of abnormal ''liver blood tests''.''The most common initial symptoms are ''fatigue'' or a sense of being abnormally tired and, skin that itches. Because of the intense ''itching'' and scratching, the skin may become darkened and discolored in some areas. The person may also complain of ''dry mouth'' and eyes.''Because there may be liver inflammation, some people may experience right upper quadrant ''abdominal pain'', where the liver is located.''Should the liver damage progress, the symptoms of cirrhosis may develop. These include muscle wasting, ''ascites'' (swelling of the abdomen due to fluid accumulation), ''leg swelling'', ''jaundice'' (yellow coloration of the skin), and ''confusion''.'  "
How is the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis made?,"'The diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis is considered when the doctor suspects that there might be liver inflammation based upon the history and physical examination. Initially there may be few symptoms like ''itching'' or ''fatigue'' to help guide further testing''The diagnosis may be made incidentally when abnormal liver functions be found on routine blood tests drawn for another reason. ''Liver function'' tests include AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), ''alkaline phosphatase'' and ''bilirubin''. Blood levels tend to become elevated in ''liver disease'' and they may rise in specific patterns depending upon the underlying cause of inflammation.''Once the diagnosis is suspected, a blood test to check for antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is usually done. This is positive in over 90% of patients with PBC.''Other blood tests may be considered including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and ''cholesterol levels''.''Imaging of the abdomen by ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' is often considered to look for structural changes in the liver and to search for tumors.''A ''liver biopsy'', where a thin needle is inserted through the skin to take a piece of liver tissue, may help confirm the diagnosis. This tissue is examined under a microscope by a pathologist to look for changes consistent with PBC. It is also useful to help stage the disease, deciding its severity at the time of diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The only ""cure"" for primary biliary cirrhosis is ''liver transplant'', but it is only considered as a treatment option if other less aggressive treatments have failed and the patient develops liver failure.''Ursodiol'' (Actigal) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first line treatment for PBC. It helps the liver transport bile into the gallbladder and intestine, in an attempt to prevent ''cholestasis''.''Depending upon the severity of the disease, immune suppression medications may be prescribed, including ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' and ''prednisone''.''Itching may be intense and difficult to control. ''Antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may be helpful but other ''drugs'' may be considered including ''cholestyramine'' (''Questran'', ''Questran Light''), which helps bind bile and decrease the itching associated with elevated bilirubin levels in the blood.''Complications of PBC will need to be cared for. These include cirrhosis, ''portal hypertension'', gastrointestinal bleeding, ''osteoporosis'', and vitamin deficiencies.' "
What are the complications of primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'The complications of primary biliary cirrhosis develop as the ability of the liver to function decreases. Cirrhosis describes liver scarring and failure. The liver is responsible for helping to digest food, producing proteins, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that help digest food. Some complications include the following:''Ascites: ''Fluid collection within the abdomen that occurs because the liver cannot produce enough albumin, a protein that helps keep fluid within the blood vessels. Ascites fluid is prone to infection and a condition called spontaneous bacterial ''peritonitis'' (peritoneum=sac that contains the abdominal organs + itis=inflammation)''Edema'': Swelling of the legs may occur, again because of decreased albumin levels in the body''Easy bruising'' or bleeding: ''The liver is responsible for producing blood clotting factors. Without an adequate supply, there is an increased risk of bleeding. Patients may have a ''low platelet count'' because of an ''enlarged spleen'' causing ''easy bruising''.''Hepatic encephalopathy'': The liver also helps remove waste products from the bloodstream. Ammonia is the chemical waste product of protein metabolism and the body requires a healthy liver to metabolize it. If ammonia levels rise, confusion and lethargy (''encephalopathy'') may occur.''P''ortal ''hypertension'':'' An increase in pressure within the liver can cause blood flow issues leading to portal ''hypertension''. This may backup blood flow from other organs, causing ''splenomegaly'', an enlarged spleen, and varices, swollen veins, especially in the ''esophagus'' and stomach that can predispose to bleeding.''Osteoporosis'':'' PBC is also complicated by ''osteoporosis'', difficulty in absorbing nutrients, such as fat-soluble ''vitamin D'' and calcium, from the intestine.''Cancer'':''\xa0Some studies show patients with PBC are at an increased risk for hepatocellular ''carcinoma''.'  "
Can primary biliary cirrhosis be prevented?,"'Since the cause of the disease is not known, it is not possible to prevent PBC. However, medications may be able to slow the progression of the disease and control the symptoms.''Should a person develop PBC, all attempts should be made to prevent further potential damage. This may include limiting ''alcohol'' intake, avoiding the use of medications that contain ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'', Panadol), and ''cholesterol'' lowering agents.' "
What is the prognosis for someone with primary biliary cirrhosis?,"'PBC is a progressive disease that can be controlled but not cured. The prognosis depends upon a variety of factors including whether the patient has symptoms (especially ''fatigue''), liver function test abnormalities, and whether the patient has undergone treatment with medication or has required liver transplantation.''Advances in treatment have extended the life expectancy in the past many years. The average survival from diagnosis for a patient with PBC who is asymptomatic is 16 years, while that of patients with symptoms is 7 1/2 years.' "
What treatments are used in patients with PBC?,'The treatments used in patients with PBC can be subdivided into:' Medications to treat PBC itself Treatments for the symptoms of PBC Treatments for the complications of PBC Treatments for the diseases associated with PBC Medications to increase bile flow from the liver Liver transplantation
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA),"'The destruction of bile ducts in PBC leads to the retention of certain toxic bile acids in the liver cells (hepatocytes). These toxic bile acids are believed to cause death of the hepatocytes and a gradual loss of ''liver function''. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA is an abbreviation for this chemical name) is a naturally occurring bile acid that is produced in small quantities by normal hepatocytes. UDCA is available to prescribe as ''ursodiol'' (Urso-250, Actigal, and generic preparations). When taken orally, UCDA is absorbed from the gut, taken up and processed by hepatocytes, and transported in bile back to the intestine. UDCA has at least four beneficial effects in PBC:''Four large-scale, ''clinical trials'' have compared the effectiveness and safety of UDCA to that of an inactive drug (a placebo). These controlled trials were done in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a spectrum of tissue abnormalities (pathology) on their liver biopsies, ranging from early disease to cirrhosis. UDCA treatment led to improvement in liver blood test abnormalities, significantly reducing elevated levels of ''bilirubin'', ''alkaline phosphatase'', gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and cholesterol. UDCA, however, did not improve ''fatigue'' or prevent or improve ''osteoporosis'', and had a variable effect on itching. Three of the four trials used a similar dose of UDCA (13-15 mg per kg body weight per day) and were combined for an analysis of a total of 548 patients.''The results of the combined analysis showed that UDCA significantly increased survival after up to 4 years of therapy, without the need for liver transplantation. The fourth large-scale study used a lower dose of UDCA (10 to 12 mg per kg per day). The results of this study differed somewhat from those of the other three studies. This one showed a benefit of UDCA treatment primarily in patients with bilirubin levels of less than 2 mg/dL. The three other studies, analyzed alone or combined, however, did not confirm this observation about the bilirubin. In fact, each of those studies actually demonstrated a benefit for patients with advanced disease and elevated bilirubin levels. Furthermore, the development of ''portal hypertension'' was reduced by the UDCA. It is important to note that despite producing clear benefits, UDCA treatment primarily '' retards'' progression and does not cure PBC.''All patients with PBC who have ''abnormal liver tests'', regardless of the stage of the liver biopsy or the phase of natural progression of the disease, probably should be treated with UDCA. The dose usually should be between 13 and 15 mg per kg body weight per day. Patients can take UDCA as either a single dose or a divided dose without affecting its clinical benefits. UDCA is very safe for long-term use. The primary side effect is ''diarrhea'', which is due to failure to absorb all of the UDCA from the gut. Patients who experience ''diarrhea'' can take smaller doses more frequently, trying to maintain the recommended total daily dose. On the other hand, patients who do not have ''diarrhea'' can try taking larger amounts per dose, with the goal of taking only one dose (again, the recommended total dose) per day at bedtime.' First, it increases the rate of bile flow from the hepatocytes, thereby combating cholestasis and diluting toxic bile acids in bile. Second, it inhibits the body's production of toxic bile acids, thereby preventing further injury to the hepatocytes. Third, it inhibits apoptosis (genetically programmed cell death), thereby preventing hepatocytes from dying. Fourth, it mildly inhibits the immune response in the liver, thereby possibly reducing immunological injury to the bile ducts and liver."
Colchicine (Colcrys),"'Colchicine, a drug that reduces inflammation and scarring, has been used primarily to treat ''arthritis'' caused by ''gout''. Three randomized, controlled trials in PBC showed that colchicine, compared to placebo, modestly slowed progression of abnormal blood tests, but did not reduce symptoms or prevent progression of liver pathology (tissue abnormalities on the biopsy). One of the trials actually suggested that colchicine improved survival. This impression of better survival with colchicine, however, has not been substantiated. In fact, the seemingly improved survival appears to be due to an unexpectedly high death rate (mortality) among the patients receiving the inactive drug in that study. The benefits of colchicine are so small that it is rarely recommended.' "
Immunosuppressive medications,"'Immunosuppressive medications, for example, corticosteroids, ''azathioprine'', ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'', ''Neoral'', ''Gengraf''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'') suppress immune reactions. These medications are theoretically attractive agents to treat PBC, based on the concept that it is an autoimmune disease. Several randomized controlled studies have tested immunosuppressive ''drugs'' in PBC. However, none of these studies has demonstrated prolonged survival of patients.' "
Corticosteroids,"'Corticosteroids, for example,''prednisone'', ''prednisolone'', and ''budesonide'' (Entocort) inhibit the initiation of immune responses, including those initial responses required for '' perpetuation'' of autoimmunity reactions. A randomized (treatment assigned by chance) controlled trial was carried out comparing a placebo with a low dose of prednisolone over a 3-year period. This study showed that prednisolone improved liver function and did not significantly increase the rate of bone thinning or demineralization. (''Osteoporosis'' is a potential side effect of steroids). Another randomized trial compared UDCA and placebo with UDCA and prednisolone in patients with early stages of PBC. Although improvement in liver function was similar for both groups, only the combination of UDCA and prednisolone resulted in markedly improved liver biopsies.''It is noteworthy that the principal benefits of corticosteroids were seen in patients with '' early'' stages of the disease on liver biopsy. Still, these treatments did not result in a full remission or cure. Moreover, neither the size nor duration of these trials was sufficient to determine an effect on survival without liver transplantation. Accordingly, more data are needed to confirm the benefit and safety in PBC of steroids alone or in combination with UDCA. Nevertheless, these studies disproved an earlier notion that corticosteroids would cause rapid progression of the bone disease osteoporosis in patients with PBC.' "
Budesonide (Entocort),"'Budesonide is a steroid that is more rapidly processed (metabolized) in the liver and, therefore, presumably would be less injurious to bone than other steroids. This drug was studied in selected patients with PBC who had had suboptimal (less than favorable) responses to UDCA. Unfortunately, budesonide was ineffective in this group. In fact it significantly worsened osteoporosis and did not prevent progression of the PBC. In contrast, a randomized trial comparing UDCA and placebo with a combination of budesonide and UDCA showed the combination to be more effective, while bone thinning (loss of mineral density) was comparable in the two groups. But here again, more data are needed to confirm the benefit and safety of this combination.' "
Azathioprine (Imuran),"'Imuran prevents the production of new lymphocytes (white blood cells that take part in immune responses) by blocking cell division (reproduction) of the lymphocytes. The consequence of this action is to reduce the number of new inflammatory cells entering the sites of inflammation. A large study comparing the effect of azathioprine with an inactive drug (placebo) in 248 patients with PBC, however, showed no benefit. Consequently, this drug is not currently recommended for use in PBC patients outside of research protocols.' "
"Cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf)","'Cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf) is used primarily to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. The drug prevents production of an important signal required for lymphocytes to divide (reproduce) and generate inflammation. A large study of 349 PBC patients, comparing cyclosporine with an inactive drug, showed some benefit from the cyclosporine. The frequency of the side effects of ''high blood pressure'' and decreased kidney function, however, make this drug unacceptable for long-term use.' "
"Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall)","'Methotrexate both suppresses the immune system and prevents cells from dividing. This drug has been used successfully in severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and an immunologic skin disease called ''psoriasis''. Initial limited trials in patients with PBC did not show a benefit, and serious side effects included ulcerations of the mouth, ''hair loss'', and ''pneumonia''. Additionally, preliminary reports of randomized, controlled trials of methotrexate therapy of PBC in Europe noted a higher than expected rate of a form of ''pneumonia'' that ''scars'' the ''lungs''. Moreover, a recently published randomized, controlled trial of low dose methotrexate in PBC showed serious toxicity over a six-year period. Currently, a large trial in the United States comparing UDCA alone to a combination of UDCA and methotrexate is underway. At present, it is premature to recommend the use of methotrexate to treat PBC outside of clinical trials.' "
Obeticolic acid (Ocaliva),"'Ocaliva was approved by the FDA in May 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with inadequate response or are intolerant to UDCA, or as a single therapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. In such patients, nearly 50% showed an improvement in the liver tests. The most common adverse effect is pruritus, observed in over 50% patients. The most common side effects include ''fatigue'', ''abdominal pain'' and discomfort, ''joint pain'', ''pain'' in the middle part of the throat, ''dizziness'', ''constipation'', and itching.' "
Cholestyramine (Questran) for itching,"'Cholestyramine'' is a drug taken orally that is not absorbed in the gut. The drug attaches (binds) to substances in the gut, including those that came from the bile, and then removes them from the body into the bowel movements. Presumably, cholestyramine is helpful because it binds both bile acids and unidentified substances that cause itching after they are absorbed from the gut into the blood stream. Cholestyramine is the most effective therapy for most patients with cholestatic itching. For optimal effects, cholestyramine should be taken with meals when bile flow into the gut is highest. A somewhat larger dose with breakfast is recommended for patients with gallbladders since the bile stored overnight in the gallbladder is released at this time.''It is important to note that cholestyramine can also bind to medications. Therefore, it is important that other medicines be taken one hour before or two hours after cholestyramine. The usual dosage is 8 grams with breakfast, 4 grams with lunch, and 4 grams with dinner. Cholestyramine does not dissolve well in liquids and often feels gritty as it is swallowed. Mixing it in carbonated ''beverages'', however, can reduce this problem. ''The principal side effect of cholestyramine is ''constipation''. The ''constipation'' occurs because the drug binds the bile acids that otherwise would make more water available in the colon to soften the ''stool''. Adverse reactions of cyclosporine include:''Another bile acid-binding medication that can be tried to relieve itching is ''colestipol'' (''Colestid'').' Kidney dysfunction Tremor High blood pressure Gum hyperplasia"
Rifampin for itching,"'An antibiotic, rifampin (Rifidin) was initially found to improve itching due to ''cholestasis'' actually by chance. Then, a study of patients with PBC that included a cross-over between rifampin and an inactive compound (placebo) showed that rifampin did reduce itching at a dose of 150 mg taken two or three times per day. This drug may take up to one month to be effective, but should not take longer. Therefore, if the drug is not effective after one month, it should be discontinued. Not all patients with PBC benefit from this drug.''The way in which rifampin works is poorly understood. It can induce biochemical pathways in hepatocytes that theoretically may alter the bile acid environment within these cells. The side effects of rifampin include elevation of bilirubin, ''dark urine'', ''hepatitis'' (more rarely), reduced numbers of blood platelets (small elements that help stop bleeding from a cut surface), and kidney damage.' "
Opiod antagonists for itching,"""The fact that some patients who receive opiate narcotics (such as morphine) develop itching led to the hypothesis that itching in cholestasis may be caused by the body's natural opiates, called endorphins. To test this hypothesis, patients with PBC who had itching were treated with the oral drug nalmephene, an antagonist (acts against or blocks the action) of opiates. Itching improved over a 9-month period. Some patients treated with the opiate antagonist, however, developed very unpleasant symptoms of opiate ""'withdrawal'' when their natural endorphins were inhibited. Therefore, this drug is not appropriate for long-term use in PBC. A controlled study comparing an intravenous opiate antagonist called naloxone (''Narcan'') with inactive intravenous fluids showed that the naloxone improved itching in PBC patients. Because it must be given intravenously, naloxone also is inappropriate for long-term use.''Recently, the oral opiate antagonist, naltrexone (Revia), was tested in a small, randomized, controlled trial in PBC patients with itching. It improved itching in 50% of patients and did not cause opiate withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone also improved symptoms of ''fatigue'' and ''depression'', possibly by restoring the ability to ''sleep'' at night when itching is most severe. However, future studies are needed to assess its safety, how long it can be given, and whether patients will eventually become unresponsive (refractory) to its effects.' "
Charcoal hemoperfusion for itching,"'In uncontrolled studies, patients with PBC who had severe itching underwent a procedure called plasmapheresis. (Uncontrolled studies are studies in which the treatment is not ''compared'' with other treatments or placebos.) In this procedure, the blood is removed from the body, and the fluid phase (called plasma) of the blood is separated from the blood cells and platelets. The plasma is then percolated through a column containing activated charcoal. Finally, the plasma is remixed with the blood cells and returned intravenously to the patient. The idea is that the charcoal would remove some compound or compounds (as yet unknown) from the plasma that caused the itching. Anecdotally, many patients had relief of itching for periods ranging from days to months. However, no controlled trials (compared with other treatments or placebos) were performed. Hence, this procedure is still considered experimental and is not often used.' "
Osteoporosis medications,"'Whether the usually recommended therapies for osteoporosis can satisfactorily treat or prevent osteoporosis in patients with PBC is not yet clear. It makes good sense, however, to provide adequate calcium and ''vitamin D'' in the ''diet''. The ''vitamin D'' is needed for absorption of calcium from the gut. Adequate amounts of calcium can be taken by eating dairy products such as milk or yogurt or by supplementing the ''diet'' with 1000 to 1500 mg of ''calcium carbonate''. Calcium carbonate, prepared from powdered oyster shells, can be purchased over the counter. Usually, the extra ''vitamin D'' contained in a daily multivitamin is enough to satisfy the daily requirement. Exposure of the skin to sunlight also increases the production of vitamin D in the body.''For ''postmenopausal'' women with PBC, hormonal replacement therapy with estrogen can decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Estrogen, available in oral form or as a patch that allows absorption of estrogen through the skin, is safe for women with PBC. Remember, however, that there is controversy about the use of ''estrogen replacement'' therapy in postmenopausal women who have had ''breast cancer'', because of a possible risk of recurrence of the ''cancer''. There is also concern about prolonged use of ''estrogens'' with progestin in increasing the risk of coronary ''heart'' diseases, ''strokes'', and ''pulmonary embolism'"" in healthy menopausal women. Therefore, whether to use estrogen or not should be individualized after consulting one's doctor. Another alternative to estrogen to protect ""'bone density'' in patients with PBC is the bisphosphonates, which are FDA-approved drugs for the ''prevention'' of osteoporosis. Too few studies have been performed using other drugs (for example, fluoride or ''calcitonin'') for osteoporosis to recommend their use in PBC.' "
Treatment of elevated serum cholesterol and xanthomas,"'Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood are common in patients with PBC, and xanthomas (fatty deposits that appear as yellowish firm nodules in the skin) occur in about 25% of those patients with elevated cholesterol. Diets with low cholesterol content do not consistently lower serum cholesterol in these patients, because production of cholesterol by the liver is stimulated in patients with PBC. Cholestyramine, the oral medication that is often used to treat itching, can, at the same time, reduce the levels of serum cholesterol to a modest degree.''Clofibrate (Atromid) should not be used for treating elevated serum cholesterol in PBC because it elevates (rather than lowers) the ''cholesterol levels'' in these patients. Moreover, this drug may worsen xanthomas and cause formation of ''gallstones'' containing cholesterol. Two studies indicate that UDCA therapy significantly reduces serum levels of cholesterol and is recommended for use in patients with xanthomas. A new class of drugs called ''statins'' inhibits formation of cholesterol and, to a lesser degree, ''triglycerides''. The safety and effectiveness of the statins, however, have not been adequately studied in PBC. One of the common side effects of statins is liver injury. Thus, their use in a person with ''liver disease'' requires careful monitoring by a physician.' "
"Treatment of malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K)","'Reduction of dietary fat is the treatment of choice for fat malabsorption (poor absorption of fat in the gut). The idea is that if the dietary intake of fat is decreased, more of this fat will be absorbed. The goal of the low-fat diet would be to alleviate the diarrhea caused by the fat malabsorption, while still providing enough fat for adequate ''nutrition''. If this diet does not help, a supplement of special ''fats'' called '' medium-chain'' ''triglycerides'' (MCT) can be ingested. MCT can replace as much as 60% of the calories provided by ordinary dietary fat, which is mostly '' long-chain'' ''triglycerides''. MCT is a special type of fat preparation that does not require bile acids for its absorption and is actually absorbed more easily than the usual dietary fat. As noted earlier, PBC patients with malabsorption of fat should also be tested for ''celiac sprue''.''It is recommended that patients with PBC take a multivitamin supplement without ''minerals'' to increase the dietary intake of fat-soluble ''vitamins''. If the quantities of bile acids flowing through the bile ducts to the gut are marginal, intestinal absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins may not be adequate, even with ''supplements''. Two strategies exist for this situation. First, patients can take Liqui-E with meals. Liqui-E is an ''over-the-counter'' liquid preparation of ''vitamin E'' that also increases the absorption of other fat-soluble vitamins in the diet or in multivitamin preparations. Second, the fat-soluble vitamins A and K can be given by injection into the muscle once a month. Remember, however, that women who might become pregnant, should not receive injections of ''vitamin A'', because it can cause ''birth defects''.' "
Treatment of edema and ascites,"'Retention of salt and water can lead to swelling of the ankles and legs (edema) or abdomen (ascites) in patients with cirrhosis. Diuretics are medications that work in the kidneys to combat retention of fluid by eliminating salt and water into the urine. A combination of the diuretics ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') and ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') can reduce or eliminate the swelling in most people. During treatment with diuretics, it is important to monitor kidney function by measuring serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ''creatinine'' to determine if the doses of the diuretics are safe. Sometimes, when the diuretics do not work, a long needle is used to draw out the fluid directly from the abdomen (a procedure called paracentesis).' "
Treatment of bleeding from varices,"'If large varices (distended veins) develop in the ''esophagus'' or upper stomach or any episodes of bleeding from varices have occurred, physicians should consider specific therapy for the varices. Treatment with ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), a drug in a class called ''beta-blockers'', is effective in preventing initial bleeding or rebleeding from varices in patients with cirrhosis. This drug, however, has not been proven to prevent bleeding in patients with portal ''hypertension'' who do not have cirrhosis.''Other methods are available to prevent or treat varices. These methods include:' Procedures done during upper endoscopy (for example band ligation of the varices) Other drugs, for example, octreotide (Sandostatin) Other non-surgical procedures (for example, a procedure called TIPS to decrease the portal pressure) A surgical operation to create a shunt (passage) from the high-pressure portal vein to veins with lower pressure can eliminate blood flow into the varices. It is appropriate to consider such a surgical shunt for patients with PBC and portal hypertension who do not have cirrhosis or have only early cirrhosis. The hazards of shunt surgery in these patients would be less than those in patients with advanced cirrhosis."
Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy,"'PBC patients with an abnormal ''sleep'' cycle, impaired thinking, odd behavior, or other signs of ''hepatic encephalopathy'' usually should be treated with a low ''protein diet'' and oral ''lactulose''. Dietary protein is restricted because it is a source of the toxic compounds present in hepatic ''encephalopathy''. The lactulose, which is a liquid medication, traps the toxic compounds in the colon. Consequently, they cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream and cause the symptoms of encephalopathy. To be sure that adequate lactulose is present in the colon at all times, the patient should adjust the dose to produce 2 to 3 semiformed bowel movements a day. If symptoms of encephalopathy persist, the oral antibiotics,\xa0such as ''rifaximin'', can be added to the treatment regimen.' "
Treatment of enlarged spleen,"'The blood filtration function of an ''enlarged spleen'' usually results in only mild reductions of ''red blood cells'' (''anemia''), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') that do not require treatment. Severe ''anemia'', however, may require blood transfusions or treatment with ''erythropoietin'' or ''epoetin alfa'' (''Epogen'', ''Procrit''), a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. If the numbers of white blood cells are severely reduced, another hormonal drug, called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is available to increase the white blood cells. An example of an available G-CSF drug is ''filgrastim'' (''Neupogen'').''No FDA-approved medication is available yet to increase the number of platelets. As a necessary precaution, patients with low platelets should not use ''aspirin'' or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDS'') since these drugs can hinder the function of platelets. If a low number of platelets is associated with significant bleeding, transfusions of platelets usually should be given. Surgical removal of the spleen (called splenectomy) should be avoided, if possible, because of the risk of excessive bleeding during the operation and the risk of anesthesia in advanced ''liver disease''.' "
Treatment of Sicca syndrome,"'Dry eyes'':'' For chronically ''dry eyes'', use artificial tears containing methylcellulose without preservatives. These artificial tears can prevent the complications of dry eyes, such as ulcers of the ''cornea''.''Dry mouth'':'' Patients with ''dry mouth'' have a reduced amount of watery saliva but maintain production of thick saliva. Chewing gum or sucking on a small object can stimulate more watery saliva. Others may need to moisten the mouth with fluids. It is imperative that all patients with ''dry mouth'' take adequate amounts of fluids to help with swallowing during meals or when taking oral medications. It is also recommended that these patients have frequent dental appointments to check for ''cavities''.''Dry vagina:'' Lubricating jelly is suggested to prevent painful sexual intercourse. If a woman is postmenopausal, estrogen creams are also recommended to improve the function of the cells lining the vagina.' "
Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon,"""PBC patients with Raynaud's phenomenon should restrict exposure to the ""'cold'"". They can wear warm clothing, gloves, and shoes when they must be in cold environments. Some patients find that using gloves also helps avoid problems when they handle ice-cold articles, for example frozen food packages and cold cans of soda. All patients with Raynaud's phenomenon should stop ""'smoking'' cigarettes because ''smoking'' causes reduced blood flow in the blood vessels of the hands and ''feet''. Drugs called ''calcium channel blockers'' help the symptoms in the hands and feet of some patients. At the same time, unfortunately, however, these drugs may worsen swallowing difficulties associated with ''scleroderma''.' "
Treatment of scleroderma,"'Skin tightening, calcification, or telangiectasia:'' There is no known therapy to prevent or reverse skin tightening, calcium deposits, or ''telangiectasias'' in patients with scleroderma.''Swallowing problems'' and ''heartburn'':'' As previously mentioned, patients with scleroderma may experience heartburn or ''difficulty swallowing''. It is recommended that patients with these symptoms or other evidence of scleroderma or the ''CREST syndrome'':' Take drugs called proton pump inhibitors 
	(PPIs) to reduce stomach acid. Avoid eating or drinking within 2 hours of lying down or going to bed. Elevate the head of the bed about 6 to 8 inches. This gentle slope helps prevent stomach acid from flowing up into the esophagus. Consult a gastroenterologist (a specialist in diseases of the esophagus and stomach) to undergo an upper endoscopy to assess the interior of esophagus and stomach."
Treatment of gallstones,"'Cholesterol ''gallstones'' may be '' prevented'' by the UDCA used for the long-term treatment of the PBC itself. (UDCA taken orally can actually dissolve cholesterol gallstones in a '' minority'' of patients.) No treatment is necessary for patients who have gallstones that are not causing symptoms. These patients should usually just be observed because they will probably never develop symptoms from their gallstones.''An operation (cholecystectomy) to remove the gallbladder and its gallstones should be considered if the gallstones have been causing symptoms. These symptoms ordinarily are bouts of rather characteristic ''abdominal pain''. This surgery usually should ''not ''be done, however, if a patient has ''advanced ''cirrhosis because of the increased risk of complications from both the surgery and the PBC. In this situation, less risky procedures can be considered or, if the gallstones are the cholesterol type, UDCA (if not already being used to treat the PBC) can be given reasonably safely to try to dissolve the gallstones.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat PBC?,"'Most often, people will contact their primary care health-care professional with questions about the color of their ''stool''. These includes health-care professionals who care for infants and children and adults. Depending upon the cause of the stool color change, certain specialists may need to be involved. For example, for red or ''black stool'' due to bleeding, a gastroenterologist may be needed to perform endoscopy, to look for a bleeding source in the stomach or intestine. Patients with PBC are generally treated by gastroenterologists and/or hepatologists. Development of complications may require the need for other specialists. For example, an endocrinologist may be needed for the treatment of metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis). Patients who develop hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' may need the help of several specialists including an oncologist, interventional radiologist, and a liver surgeon. Patients with advanced liver disease including cirrhosis of the liver should be referred to a transplant center as they may need a ''liver transplant'' at some stage in the future.  ' "
What is the role of liver transplantation in PBC?,"'Liver transplantation is a life-saving operation for those patients with PBC who are at risk of premature death due to liver failure or the complications of cirrhosis and portal ''hypertension''. The Mayo Risk Score provides an accurate estimate of the future outcome (prognosis) for patients, regardless of whether they are being treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) permits patients with PBC to be listed for a liver transplant once their estimated survival with PBC for an additional year is 95% or less. It is recommended that physicians calculate the Mayo Risk Score at least yearly in all patients with PBC who have cirrhosis.''Most PBC candidates for transplantation have advanced cirrhosis with ''decompensated'' liver disease, which also is referred to as liver failure. Decompensated liver disease means that the patients have low levels of serum albumin and blood clotting factors made in the liver and complications of portal venous hypertension such as ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or hypersplenism. Patients are classified as having decompensated cirrhosis whether or not the complications respond to medical therapy.''Rarely, '' before'' advanced cirrhosis develops, transplantation of the liver is warranted in a few clinically disastrous situations in PBC. Examples of such situations include recurrent ''fractures'' due to advanced osteoporosis or severe, debilitating itching unrelieved by any medical therapy, and even more rarely the hepatopulmonary syndrome (''breathing'' difficulty in advanced cirrhosis). The regional review committees of UNOS accept applications for transplantation in these special circumstances and decide on a patient-by-patient basis if liver transplantation is indicated.''The outcome of liver transplantation in PBC is excellent. The survival of patients two or more years after transplantation is generally 80%. This impressive survival rate is greater than the survival of patients transplanted for most other types of liver diseases. The titers of AMA fall following successful liver transplantation, but they do not usually disappear. A minority of patients, however, develops recurrent PBC in the transplanted liver. Studies are being performed to see if reducing the maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs more slowly after transplantation can prevent recurrence of PBC. Once recurrent PBC is diagnosed, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is started to retard progression. Patients with recurrent PBC rarely will need a second liver transplant.' "
What is the future for PBC?,"'The goal of ongoing and future research in PBC is to better understand the processes (mechanisms) that initiate and perpetuate the inflammation that destroys first the small caliber bile ducts and later the hepatocytes. Logically, a more complete understanding of these mechanisms will reveal new strategies for therapy, designed to block specific crucial steps in the progression of disease.''PBC is such a slowly progressive disease that it is often initially diagnosed after the development of cirrhosis. Future therapies will probably include strategies that differ for patients with early disease compared to those with advanced disease. Presumably, patients with early phases of PBC would benefit more from therapies that block immunologic mechanisms of bile duct destruction than would patients whose bile ducts have already been destroyed. Conversely, patients whose bile ducts have already been destroyed may benefit more from therapies that prevent the formation of ''scar tissue'' and the toxic consequences of cholestasis.''The key to success is support of both basic science and clinical research in PBC, which have not been adequately funded in the past. Several promising research strategies are being pursued to reveal the mechanisms involved in developing PBC. For example, studies are in progress to evaluate the genetic (hereditary) characteristics of patients with PBC who have close relatives with the disease. By studying all of these patients with PBC and comparing them with other family members without PBC, it may be possible to better understand the predispositions to this disease. In addition, a large-scale study is underway in the United States that will compare PBC patients with healthy people of the same age and gender. The points of comparison will include their life experiences, habits, diet, medical and surgical histories, childbearing history, and exposures to environmental toxins and medications. This study likewise should provide important clues regarding predispositions to PBC.'' Studies also are in progress to see if PBC may be initiated (triggered) by an infection with either bacteria or ''viruses''. For example, studies are ongoing to confirm or disprove the notion that proteins of infectious organisms stimulate AMA autoantibodies (and the autoantibodies just happen to react to antigens present in the mitochondria). Other studies are dissecting the mechanisms involved in the lymphocyte migration toward small bile ducts and the lymphocyte killing of bile duct epithelial cells. These studies involve not only ''patients'' with PBC, but also several animal models in which T-lymphocytes destroy small bile ducts in an identical manner to that seen in PBC. These studies ultimately should identify new ways to treat PBC by, for example, blocking the killing of bile ducts by T-lymphocytes.''Finally, the issue of ''scar'' tissue formation in PBC and other diseases associated with cholestasis is now being researched in the hope of finding a way to prevent the development of cirrhosis. If cirrhosis can be prevented, even if ongoing inflammation of the liver continues, many patients might not develop the complications of portal venous hypertension and the progression to liver failure.'

What is primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'Primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) is a condition in which the immune system is weaker than normal. The term ""primary"" implies that there is an independent problem of the immune system rather than a weakening of the immune system due to another condition like ''HIV/AIDS'' (a secondary immune deficiency). ''Primary immunodeficiency disease is most often identified in infants and children, but it is possible that the condition is identified in adulthood. Primary immunodeficiency disease represents a diverse group of hundreds of diseases that can weaken the immune system. ''Most often, primary immunodeficiency disease results in increased susceptibility to both acute and chronic (long-term) infections.'  "
What are the types and examples of primary immunodeficiency diseases?,"'Primary immunodeficiency disease is a group of multiple different diseases. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes over 250 diseases that lead to primary immunodeficiency. The conditions that are immune deficient can include problems with antibody formation, problems with cell-mediated immune response, or innate immune system disorders.''The types of primary immunodeficiency disease are far too numerous to list here. Examples of some of the more commonly known primary immunodeficiency diseases include:'  Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome Severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease (SCID) DiGeorge syndrome 
Ataxia-telangectasia Chronic granulomatous disease Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of 
infancy Agammaglobulinemia Complement deficiencies Selective IgA deficiency"
"What causes primary immunodeficiency disease and who gets primary 
immunodeficiency disease?","'Most primary immunodeficiency diseases are inherited, meaning that there is a gene defect present at birth that leads to the condition. As such, the condition usually is seen in infants or children. Sometimes, however, the condition may not become apparent until late childhood or even adulthood.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'Many of the specific forms of primary immunodeficiency disease will have symptoms and signs specific to that condition, but in general, PIDDs are characterized by ''frequent infections''. In particular, symptoms and signs suggestive of primary immunodeficiency disease can include:'  Frequent or hard-to-treat infections 
Recurrent pneumonia, sinus infections, 
or ear infections Weight loss or delayed growth Enlarged lymph nodes Enlarged spleen Recurrent deep abscesses in internal 
organs Recurrent skin abscesses Digestive problems, including nausea, 
diarrhea, or abdominal cramping Abnormal blood counts"
Is primary immunodeficiency disease inherited?,"'Most cases of PIDD are genetic, inherited diseases.' "
"Which types of doctors treat primary immunodeficiency 
disease?","'Immunologists are scientists or doctors who specialize in diseases of the immune system. Immunologist physicians may manage the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency disease. Infectious disease specialists are also frequently involved in the care of these patients. Depending on the exact cause of primary immunodeficiency disease, other specialists may be consulted, including neurologists, hematologists, rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, and others. ' "
How is primary immunodeficiency disease diagnosed?,"'Any patient suspected of having a primary immunodeficiency disease will undergo a thorough medical examination. Blood tests are typically done to make the diagnosis. Blood tests are done to check for immune cell counts as well as levels of antibodies and other substances necessary for a functioning immune system. DNA testing may be done to identify a specific genetic defect.''In families with a known history of primary immunodeficiency disease, ''prenatal testing'' may be done to detect genetic problems in the developing fetus.' "
What is the treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'To treat recurrent infections ''antibiotics, antiviral medications, and antifungal drugs may be used. These medications may be stronger than those used to treat infections in people with a normally functioning immune system and may need to be administered intravenously (IV). Sometimes, long-term antibiotics are given to prevent the development of infections. ''To boost the immune system:'' The treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease depends upon the specific defect that is causing the immune system to malfunction. Examples of immune system treatments include:''Stem cell transplantation '""can be used to replace the defective immune system in patients with severe or life-threatening types of primary immunodeficiency disease. This requires a stem cell donor that is a biologic match to the patient. Typically, the patient's immune system is destroyed via ""'chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'', and the normal ''stem cells'' are transferred to the patient. Stem cell transplantation has a number of risks and is not always successful, but it can offer some patients with primary immunodeficiency disease a permanent cure.'  Intravenous or subcutaneous 
immunoglobulins to provide antibodies to fight infection Growth factor therapy if immune 
function deficiency is due to lack of certain immune cells

Can primary immunodeficiency disease be prevented?,"'Because most cases of primary immunodeficiency disease result from an inherited gene defect, there is no way to prevent their occurrence.' "
What the prognosis for a child with primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'Because primary immunodeficiency disease represents a group of hundreds of different diseases, it is not possible to assign a prognosis to this group of conditions in general. Many children and adults with primary immunodeficiency disease can attend school or work and maintain productive lives.' "
What support groups are available for primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'The Immune Deficiency Foundation'' offers a number of support and educational resources, including ''peer support programs''. Your treatment center or care team may also have information about specific support programs in your area.' "
Facts you should know about primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),"'Primary sclerosing cholangitis'' describes a disease process in which the bile ducts in the ''liver'' become inflamed, narrow and prevent bile from flowing properly.''The liver produces bile to help digest food in the intestine. Bile from liver cells is transported through the bile ducts in the biliary tree, where it then enters the gallbladder. When food enters the small intestine, bile helps break down fat into fatty acids so that they can be absorbed and used by the body. This also helps in the absorption of fat soluble ''vitamins'' (A, D, E & K).''As the bile ducts become inflamed and narrow, bile cannot easily flow and begins to back up. This increases the pressure within the liver causing liver cells to become inflamed. Over time, this inflammation decreases blood flow within the liver, increasing the pressure in the portal vein. This eventually causes ''portal hypertension'', a backup in the portal system causing veins that line the ''esophagus'', stomach, and intestine to swell (varices) and the spleen to swell (''splenomegaly'').''As the disease progress, liver cells die and are replace by ''scar tissue''. This is called ''cirrhosis'' and is associated with liver failure.'  "
What causes primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The cause of ''PSC'' is unknown but it has an association with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease, especially ''ulcerative colitis'"". It is thought that there may be an autoimmune component to the disease, where the body's immune system attacks the bile ducts in the liver and causes them to become, inflamed and narrowed."" "
What are the risk factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The cause of PSC is unknown but it may be an autoimmune disease. ''PSC is more often seen in men in the 20-30 age range. There is an association with ''inflammatory bowel'', disease, most often with ''ulcerative colitis'' and less commonly with '""Crohn's Disease""'. ''People with PSC who do not have ''inflammatory bowel disease'', are more likely to be female and older.' "
What are primary sclerosing cholangitis symptoms and signs?,"'In its early stages, PSC is asymptomatic (there are no symptoms). It is only when the person develops ''cholestasis'' because of the inability of bile to drain from the liver, do symptoms occur. These early symptoms include ''itching'' and ''fatigue''. As the ''bilirubin'' levels in the blood become elevated, ''jaundice'' or a yellowish tinge to the skin, may occur. Since there may be liver inflammation, the person may complain of ''pain'' beneath the ribs in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.''The inability of the bile ducts to adequately drain reduces the flow of bile and there can be sludge formation in the bile ducts leading to the risk of infection. This may cause ''fever'' and increased ''pain''.''Because PSC is a progressive disease, symptoms may come and go over several months and years after the diagnosis is made.''As the disease progresses, ''cirrhosis'' may occur leading to decreased ''liver function'' and its associated signs and symptoms. These include bleeding from the esophagus and stomach due to varices, ''ascites'' (fluid collection in the abdomen) because of poor protein production by the liver, ''easy bruising'' because of decreased platelets in the blood as because they are trapped in the ''enlarged spleen'', and ''confusion'' due to ''hepatic encephalopathy'' because the liver cannot clear waste products of metabolism.'  "
How do doctors make a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'PSC may remain silent for several years before symptoms arise. In patients with ''inflammatory bowel disease'', the health care professional should have a high suspicion of the diagnosis because of the relationship between PSC and ''ulcerative colitis''.''Depending upon how far the disease has progressed and the effect on liver function, physical examination may reveal an ''enlarged liver'', tenderness in the right upper quadrant beneath the ribs, and an ''enlarged spleen''. The skin may be jaundiced or yellow and there can be evidence of scratching due to intense skin ''itching''. In cirrhosis with end stage ''liver disease'', there may be ''bruising'' of the skin, a swollen abdomen due to ''ascites'' or fluid caused by decreased protein production and decreased blood flow through the scarred liver, gastrointestinal bleeding, and mental confusion because of elevated ammonia levels in the bloodstream.''Blood tests are helpful in assessing the liver and potential blockages within the bile ducts. These may include a ''complete blood count'', INR/PTT (that measures blood clotting and the ability of the liver to produce clotting factors), liver function studies including AST, and ALT to assess liver inflammation, ''alkaline phosphatase'' and bilirubin which measure the degree of bile blockage.''Imaging tests may include ''ultrasound'' to look at the liver structure and magnetic resonance cholangiogram, an ''MRI'' of the abdomen that can assess the bile duct structure of the liver.''If the diagnosis based on laboratory tests and imaging is still in doubt, a biopsy may be performed. A ''gastroenterologist'' or interventional radiologist will place a long, fine needle through the skin into the liver to obtain a piece of tissue. This is analyzed under a microscope by a pathologist to make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The treatment of PSC is supportive, monitoring the progression of the disease and treating symptoms and complications as they arise. The only ""cure"" is liver transplantation, which may be an option when the disease progresses to cirrhosis and the liver function is affected.''When some of the larger bile ducts become blocked, there is potential to open them with ''ERCP'' (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and balloon dilatation and/or ''stent'' placement. A gastroenterologist passes a thin video endoscope into the mouth and threads it through the stomach into the duodenum and using a catheter, enters the bile ducts. Should a narrow duct or stricture be found, a balloon can be used to dilate the narrowing and a stent can be placed to keep the duct open. This is similar to how a cardiologist opens a blocked blood vessel in the ''heart''In some cases, surgery may be an option to remove some scarred and blocked bile ducts and having more normal bile ducts reconnected bypassing scarred areas of the bile ducts.' "
Medications for primary sclerosing cholangitis,"'There is no medication that is approved to treat primary sclerosing cholangitis, but medications may be used to control symptoms. ''Ursodiol'' (Actigal), also known as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may improve liver function tests but has not been shown to increase survival and may be associated with complications like bleeding. While it is thought that PSC may be an autoimmune disease, immunosuppressive medications have not been shown to work.''Itching is often treated with ''antihistamines'' including ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax) and ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''). ''Cholestyramine'' (''Questran'', ''Questran Light''), a medication that helps bind bile salts may also be helpful.''Should infection occur, treatment may require antibiotics.''As the disease progresses, the damaged liver may not be able to help with the absorption of ''vitamins'' and nutrients from the intestine. Vitamins and other dietary and calorie ''supplements'' may be required to treat malnutrition.'  "
Liver transplant,"'Liver transplant'' is the only ""cure"" for primary sclerosing cholangitis, but it is only recommended for patients whose disease has progressed to liver failure. The three-year U.S. survival rate for all transplants is 81%. The five-year survival rate is about 75%, according to the data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.''The goal of liver transplantation is to restore liver function. Though unlikely, it is possible for PSC to recur in the new liver.' "
What complications are associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'PSC is a progressive disease, damaging the bile ducts and reducing the bile flow, ultimately leading to portal ''hypertension'', cirrhosis, and liver failure.''Some ''cancers'' are associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis including ''gallbladder cancer'', hepatocellular ''cancer'' (''cancer of the liver'' cells) and ''cholangiocarcinoma'' (''cancer'' of the bile ducts). The combination of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and PSC increases the risk of developing cancers of the colon and rectum'  "
Is it possible to prevent primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The specific cause of PSC is still unknown and therefore it seems not to be preventable. It is appropriate for patients with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease (especially ulcerative ''colitis'') and their health care professional to be aware of the relationship with primary sclerosing cholangitis, in case symptoms suggestive of the disease arise. However, PSC is seen in only 3% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'Aside from liver transplantation, there are no effective treatments for PSC. In the US, studies suggest that life expectancy ranges from 9 to 18 years if the patient does not undergo liver transplantation. Using different population study models, researchers in the Netherlands concluded that life expectancy may be longer than 21 years from the time when the diagnosis is made.''The prognosis and life expectance is poorer in older patients, those who have an enlarged liver and spleen, and in patients who are persistently jaundiced with elevated bilirubin levels in their bloodstream.' "
What is photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)?,"'Photorefractive ''keratectomy'' (PRK) is ''laser eye surgery'' that reduces the need for corrective ''eyewear'' by reshaping the ''cornea'"" of the eye, thereby changing the way the eye focuses light on the retina. An excimer laser ablates (removes) a thin layer of the cornea at its surface, changing the cornea's refractive (focusing) power.""'LASIK'' (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis) eye surgery is a similar procedure except first a medical professional creates a flap within the cornea with either a laser or a microkeratome blade and then performs the ablation below the flap, deeper in the cornea. In ''LASEK'' (laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis), a medical professional makes a thinner flap of just the outer layer (epithelium) and performs the ablation under the epithelium. There are pros and cons to weigh in choosing between ''LASIK'', LASEK, and PRK. In terms of cost, photorefractive keratectomy is usually less expensive than LASIK. Postoperative discomfort is typically less of an issue with LASIK. Ultimately, the choice comes down to which procedure will produce the most safe and reliable outcome, and factors such as corneal health and degree of refractive error determine this.' "
What vision problems does photorefractive keratectomy treat?,"'PRK can treat a variety of refractive errors, including ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness''), ''hyperopia'' (''farsightedness''), and ''astigmatism'"" (imperfection in the eye's curvature of the cornea or ""'lens'""). The laser treats certain medical conditions affecting the eye's surface (for example, Salzmann's nodules and recurrent erosions). When physicians use the laser for these indications, the procedure is referred to as phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)."" "
Who is a good candidate for PRK?,"'The ideal candidate is someone whose corneal tissue is well suited for the procedure. Patients must first meet several criteria. For example, corneal thickness is important. Larger corrections require more tissue ablation so thin corneas may not be suitable for refractive surgery, particularly in patients with very high ''myopia''. The surgeon will calculate if there will be sufficient residual corneal tissue to perform the ablation safely.''The eye doctor reviews the medical history and performs a complete eye examination to look for any ''eye problems'' or medical conditions that might affect the outcome of refractive surgery. Poor eye health or certain medical diseases (for example, uncontrolled ''diabetes'') may increase the risk of a poor outcome.'""Age is another factor. If a candidate's eyes are still growing (for example, in childhood and in the teen years), the refractive error may not have stabilized. Undergoing photorefractive keratectomy too soon may only provide a temporary correction of the refractive error, since the eye is still changing."" "
What are the potential side effects and complications of PRK?,"'Common side effects in the days following the PRK procedure include discomfort, ''dry eye'', foreign body sensation (gritty or sandy feeling), ''blurred vision'', and glare or haloes around lights. These symptoms tend to resolve as the eye heals. Visual recovery takes a few days, and the final uncorrected visual acuity (vision without glasses) typically stabilizes after a few months.''Long-term under-correction or overcorrection can result from variable healing rates, inaccuracies in calculations, or unstable refractive errors.''Uncommon but potentially serious complications include infection, irregular shape, and thinning of the cornea (ectasia), elevated ''intraocular pressure'' (sometimes related to postoperative steroid eyedrops), scarring, or persistent corneal erosions. These complications could result in visual blurring or glare, ''vision loss'', light sensitivity, or ''pain''. These complications have become less common with improvements in preoperative screening, more sophisticated laser ablation profiles, and better medication regimens for optimized healing.' "
How do I prepare for PRK?,"'The eye surgeon first determines if your eyes are suitable for PRK surgery in the preoperative screening.''You may be asked to refrain from wearing hard (rigid) ''contact lenses'' for up to several weeks or soft contact lenses for several days in preparation for both the preoperative screening and the procedure itself. This is important because contact lenses can temporarily reshape the cornea. You will want your cornea to be in its “natural,” unaltered state when being measured preoperatively and when being treated.''On the day of PRK surgery, do not wear ''makeup'' or perfume. Be sure to have your postoperative medications ready and review the instructions for their use.' "
What happens during the PRK procedure?,"'Typically, the patient lies on his/her back. A small lid speculum holds the eyelids open. Once the eye is numbed with anesthetic drops, the surgeon removes the outer layer (epithelium) of the cornea either mechanically (with a tiny brush or a sweeping tool) or with laser. Once the surgeon removes the epithelium, laser is applied to the surface of the cornea to precisely ablate (remove) a thin layer of corneal tissue based on the amount of myopic, hyperopic, or ''astigmatic'' correction desired. A clicking or tapping sound might be heard as the laser fires. Once the laser ablation is complete, the surgeon places a contact lens. Medical professionals remove this ""bandage"" contact lens once the epithelium heals, typically a few days later (about three to five days). The postoperative medicated eye drops are used with the contact lens in place.' "
What follow-up care do people need after PRK? What is the recovery time for PRK?,"'At the completion of your surgery, you will need someone to drive for you. You can expect to be very light sensitive, so be sure to have ''sunglasses'' with you.''Medical professionals will instruct you to use prescription medicated eyedrops afterward. These may include steroids, anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', and antibiotics. The drops are very important for healing well. They serve to control inflammation and prevent infection, as well as to minimize discomfort.''You can expect a mild to moderate amount of ''eye pain'' (light sensitivity, foreign body sensation) for the first few days as the epithelium heals. You may need to take oral medication for ''pain''.''Close monitoring of the healing process is also very important. Be sure to keep all scheduled follow-up appointments. The number and frequency of follow-up visits will depend on how quickly the eye heals. It may take several weeks to three months to reach your best corrected vision (stable refraction).' "
What is the prognosis after a photorefractive keratectomy?,"'Generally, the success rate is very good. Assuming there are no underlying medical conditions that could adversely affect the healing process, the surface of the eye (epithelium) usually heals in a few days, achieving a stable refraction in the weeks and months following the procedure. Because the surgeon made no flap, there are no concerns about the flap-related complications sometimes seen after LASIK surgery.''Over time, there may be a need to use corrective eyewear again, either because some of the corrective effect regresses or because the underlying refractive error was still in flux and had not stabilized completely prior to the procedure. Re-treatment with further photorefractive keratectomy is often possible at a later date.''Patients over the age of 40 who correct their distance vision with photorefractive keratectomy will still need to use reading glasses when ''presbyopia'' sets in. ''Presbyopia'' is the inability to see well close-up due to age-related changes in the eye\'s lens. Patients over 40 who already have presbyopia can opt to have one eye corrected for distance while having the other eye corrected for near. This is called ""monovision."" The eye doctor will discuss these options with you in the preoperative screening.' "
What is problem sleepiness?,"'Everyone feels sleepy at times. However, when sleepiness interferes with daily routines and activities, or reduces the ability to function, it is called ""problem sleepiness."" A person can be sleepy without realizing it. For example, a person may not feel sleepy during activities such as talking and listening to music at a party, but the same person can fall asleep while driving home afterward.' "
What are the symptoms of problem sleepiness?,"'You may have problem sleepiness if you:'   consistently do not get enough sleep, or get poor 
  quality sleep; fall asleep while driving; struggle to stay awake when inactive, such as when 
  watching television or reading; have difficulty paying attention or concentrating at 
  work, school, or home; have performance problems at work or school; are often told by others that you are sleepy; have difficulty remembering; have slowed responses; have difficulty controlling your emotions; or must take naps on most days."
What causes problem sleepiness?,"""Sleepiness can be due to the body's natural daily sleep-wake cycles, inadequate sleep, sleep disorders, or certain drugs."" "
Sleep-wake cycle,"""Each day there are two periods when the body experiences a natural tendency toward sleepiness; during the late night hours (generally between midnight and 7 a.m.) and again during the midafternoon (generally between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.). If people are awake during these times, they have a higher risk of falling asleep unintentionally, especially if they haven't been getting enough sleep."" "
Inadequate sleep,"'The amount of sleep needed each night varies among people. Each person needs a particular amount of sleep in order to be fully alert throughout the day. Research has shown that when healthy adults are allowed to sleep unrestricted, the average time slept is 8 to 8.5 hours. Some people need more than that to avoid problem sleepiness; others need less.''If a person does not get enough sleep, even on one night, a ""sleep debt"" begins to build and increases until enough sleep is obtained. Problem sleepiness occurs as the debt accumulates. Many people do not get enough sleep during the work week and then sleep longer on the weekends or days off to reduce their sleep debt. If too much sleep has been lost, sleeping in on the weekend may not completely reverse the effects of not getting enough sleep during the week.' "
Sleep disorders,"'Sleep disorders such as ''sleep apnea'', ''narcolepsy'', ''restless legs syndrome'', and ''insomnia'' can cause problem sleepiness. ''Sleep apnea'"" is a serious disorder in which a person's ""'breathing'' is interrupted during sleep, causing the individual to awaken many times during the night and experience problem sleepiness during the day. People with ''narcolepsy'' have excessive sleepiness during the day, even after sleeping enough at night. They may fall asleep at inappropriate times and places. ''Restless legs syndrome (''RLS'')'' causes a person to experience unpleasant sensations in the legs, often described as creeping, crawling, pulling, or painful. These sensations frequently occur in the evening, making it difficult for people with ''RLS'' to fall asleep, leading to problem sleepiness during the day. ''''Insomnia'' is the perception of poor-quality sleep due to difficulty falling asleep, waking up during the night with difficulty returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, or unrefreshing sleep. Any of these sleep disorders can cause problem sleepiness. ' "
Medical conditions/drugs,"'Certain medical conditions and drugs, including prescription medications, can also disrupt sleep and cause problem sleepiness. Examples include:'  Chronic illnesses such as asthma, 
	congestive heart 
  failure, rheumatoid arthritis, or any other chronically painful disorder; Some medications to treat high blood pressure, some 
  heart medications, and asthma medications such as theophylline; Alcohol-Although some people use alcohol to help 
  themselves fall asleep, it causes sleep disruption during the night, which can 
  lead to problem sleepiness during the day. Alcohol is also a sedating drug 
  that can, even in small amounts, make a sleepy person much more sleepy and at 
  greater risk for car crashes and performance problems; Caffeine-Whether consumed in coffee, tea, soft drinks, or 
 medications, caffeine makes it 
  harder for many people to fall asleep and stay asleep. Caffeine stays in the 
  body for about 3 to 7 hours, so even when taken earlier in the day it can 
  cause problems with sleep at night; and Nicotine from 
  cigarettes or a skin patch is a stimulant and makes it 
 harder to fall asleep and stay asleep."
Problem sleepiness and adolescents,"'Many U.S. high school and college students have signs of problem sleepiness, such as:''The need for sleep may be 9 hours or more per night as a person goes through adolescence. At the same time, many ''teens'' begin to show a preference for a later bed time, which may be due to a biological change. Teens tend to stay up later but have to get up early for school, resulting in their getting much less sleep than they need.''Many factors contribute to problem sleepiness in teens and young adults, but the main causes are not getting enough sleep and irregular sleep schedules. Some of the factors that influence adolescent sleep include:''Teens and young adults who do not get enough sleep are at risk for problems such as:''Many adolescents have part-time jobs in addition to their classes and other activities. High school students who work more than 20 hours per week have more problem sleepiness and may use more caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol than those who work less than 20 hours per week or not at all.'   difficulty getting up for school; falling asleep at school; and/or struggling to stay awake while doing homework. social activities with peers that lead to later 
  bedtimes; homework to be done in the evenings; early wake-up times do to early school start times; parents being less involved in setting and enforcing 
  bedtimes; and employment, sports, or other extracurricular activities that decrease 
 the time available for sleep. automobile crashes; poor performance in school and poor grades; depressed moods; and problems with peer and adult relationships."
Shift work and problem sleepiness,"'About 20 million Americans (20 to 25 percent of workers) perform shift work. Most shift workers get less sleep over 24 hours than day workers. Sleep loss is greatest for night shift workers, those who work early morning shifts, and female shift workers with children at home. About 60 to 70 percent of shift workers have difficulty sleeping and/or problem sleepiness.''The human sleep-wake system is designed to prepare the body and mind for sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. These natural rhythms make it difficult to sleep during daylight hours and to stay awake during the night hours, even in people who are well rested. It is possible that the ''human body'' never completely adjusts to nighttime activity and daytime sleep, even in those who work permanent night shifts.''In addition to the sleep-wake system, environmental factors can influence sleepiness in shift workers. Because our society is strongly day-oriented, shift workers who try to sleep during the day are often interrupted by noise, light, telephones, family members, and other distractions. In contrast, the nighttime sleep of day workers is largely protected by social customs that keep noises and interruptions to a minimum.''Problem sleepiness in shift workers may result in:'   increased risk for automobile crashes, especially 
  while driving home after a night shift; decreased quality of life; decreased productivity (night work performance may be 
  slower and less accurate than day performance); and/or increased risk of accidents and injuries at work."
"What treatments and remedies can help problem 
sleepiness?","'Sleep-There is no substitute!''Many people simply do not allow enough time for sleep on a regular basis. A first step may be to evaluate daily activities and sleep-wake patterns to determine how much sleep is obtained. If you are consistently getting less than 8 hours of sleep per night, more sleep may be needed. A good approach is to gradually move to an earlier bedtime. For example, if an extra hour of sleep in needed, try going to bed 15 minutes earlier each night for four nights and then keep the last bedtime. This method will increase the amount of time in bed without causing a sudden change in schedule. However, if work or family schedules do not permit the earlier bedtime, a 30 to 60 minute daily nap may help.''Medications/drugs''In general, medications do not help problem sleepiness, and some make it worse. Caffeine can reduce sleepiness and increase alertness, but only temporarily. It can also cause problem sleepiness to become worse by interrupting sleep.''While alcohol may shorten the time it takes to fall asleep, it can disrupt sleep later in the night, and therefore add to the problem sleepiness.''Medications may be prescribed for patients in certain situations. For example, the short-term use of sleeping pills has been shown to be helpful in patients diagnosed with acute insomnia. Long-term use of sleep medication is recommended only for the treatment of specific sleep disorders.'""If you're sleepy—don't drive!""'A person who is sleepy and drives is at high risk for an automobile crash. Planning ahead may help reduce that risk. For example, the following tips may help when planning a long distance car trip:''If you are a shift worker, the following may help:''If you think you are getting enough sleep, but still feel sleepy during the day, check with your doctor to be sure your sleepiness is not due to a sleep disorder.'   Get a good night's sleep before leaving Avoid driving between midnight and 7 a.m. Change drivers often to allow for rest periods Schedule frequent breaks decreasing the amount of night work; increasing the total amount of sleep by adding naps 
  and lengthening the amount of time allotted for sleep; increasing the intensity of light at work; having a predictable schedule of night shifts; eliminating sound and light in the bedroom during 
  daytime sleep; using caffeine (only during the first part of the 
  shift) to promote alertness at night; or possibly using prescription sleeping pills to help daytime sleep on 
 occasional basis (check with your doctor)."
Breastfeeding issues,"'Breast milk'' is the best ''diet'' for infants. ''Breastfeeding'' has several health benefits for the mother and her baby; moreover, it also builds an emotional bonding between them. Experts recommend exclusive breastfeeding until the baby is six months. This means that apart from breastmilk, the baby should not be given any fluids or solids till they reach six months of age, even water. This, however, may not be done because of several problems a mother may face when she is breastfeeding her young one. Most of these problems can be solved by seeking medical help. Thus, whenever a woman finds it difficult to breastfeed, it is advisable to seek help from their doctor, nurse, or a board-certified lactation counselor.''Some of the common problems mothers face when breastfeeding are described below.''Insufficient breast milk production:'' Many women give up breastfeeding because they think that their breast milk is not enough in quantity for the baby. Insufficient milk production may occur if''To stimulate milk production, the mother may''Breast and ''nipple'' ''pain'':'' This may occur due to''Mastitis'':'' It is a common cause of ''breast pain''. Inflammation of the breasts is called mastitis. It is often associated with ''breast pain'', swelling, redness, and ''fever''. Mastitis may or may not be caused by an infection. Although it can happen any time during lactation, it is commonly seen during the first six weeks after delivery. Mastitis may result due to nipple damage (such as cracked nipples) or prolonged breast engorgement. You must seek medical help if''Untreated mastitis may lead to the collection of pus, forming a breast ''abscess'' that needs surgical drainage.''Fungal infections'':'' Yeast infections are common in lactating women and can cause severe breast pain. There may be a history of vaginal ''yeast infection'' or the presence of ''thrush'' or ''diaper rash'' in their infant. The skin on the breast may appear shiny or flaky. Your doctor may prescribe treatment such as antifungal creams or gels and antifungal pills for treatment. A purple medication called gentian violet (0.25-1%) may be prescribed for application in your baby’s mouth before breastfeeding.''Bloody ''nipple discharge'': ''Bloody discharge from the nipples may occur during the first few days to weeks of lactation. The condition is more common in the first pregnancy and is also called rusty pipe syndrome. Breast milk may appear pink or red and is caused by increased blood flow to the breast tissue. This usually resolves within a few days. If bloody nipple discharge continues for over a week, medical help must be sought.''Breast milk overproduction: ''Excessive milk production beyond the infant’s demand can also make breastfeeding difficult. Milk oversupply may cause a sudden rush of milk that may make the infant choke or ''cough'' during breastfeeding. They may even bite the mother’s nipple in an attempt to clamp to it. Milk overproduction may also cause breast engorgement and pain.''The condition may subside on its own. You may consult your healthcare provider to know if overproduction is due to some hormones or medications.' There was inadequate breast development during pregnancy. The mother underwent breast surgery or radiation therapy. There is a hormonal imbalance in the mother. The mother takes medications that interfere with milk production. Feed the baby from both the breasts during feeds. Stay calm and relaxed while feeding the baby. Keep the baby close to her and hold them skin-to-skin. Feed the baby frequently (around 8-12 times per 24 hours in the first week of life, gradually decreasing to seven to nine times per 24 hours by the fourth week). Take a healthy diet. Consult her doctor to know what is causing less milk production. Breast engorgement (a condition in which the breasts become painfully overfull of milk). Nipple injury caused by the baby or a breast pump. Blocked milk ducts in the breasts. Breast and nipple infections. Excessive milk production. Skin conditions affecting the breast such as eczema or psoriasis. Sore or cracked nipples: You must consult your healthcare provider to resolve pain in the breasts or nipples. Keeping the nipples dry after feeds is important. You should not use harsh soaps or cleansers on your nipples or breasts. You must not use vitamin E on your nipples because it may be toxic for your baby in high quantities. Your doctor will also help diagnose and manage any inborn problems with the baby, such as a tongue-tie, which may be causing problems with breastfeeding. Using warm compresses and over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may lower the pain. You have a firm, painful, and red area on the breasts. You have a fever higher than 101°F or 38.5°C. You develop muscle pain, chills, or other flu-like symptoms."
Introduction,"'Tooth sensitivity following placement of a filling is fairly common. A tooth may be sensitive to pressure, air, sweet foods, or temperature. Usually, the sensitivity resolves on its own within a few weeks. During this time, avoid those things that are causing the sensitivity. ''Pain'' relievers are generally not required.''Contact your dentist if the sensitivity does not subside within 2 to 4 weeks or if your tooth is extremely sensitive. He or she may recommend you use a desensitizing ''toothpaste'', may apply a desensitizing agent to the tooth, or possibly suggest a ''root canal'' procedure.' "
Pain Around Fillings,"'There are several explanations for ''pain'' around ''fillings'', each resulting from a different cause.' Pain when you bite. With this type of pain, the pain occurs when you bite down. The pain is noticed soon after the anesthesia wears off and continues over time. In this case, the filling is interfering with your bite. You will need to return to your dentist and have the filling reshaped. Pain when your teeth touch. This pain is a very sharp pain that occurs only when your teeth touch. The pain is likely caused by the touching of two different metal surfaces (for example, the silver amalgam in a newly filled tooth and a gold crown on another tooth with which it touches). This pain should resolve on its own within a short period of time. ""Toothache-type"" pain. If the decay was very deep to the pulp of the tooth, this ""toothache"" response may indicate this tissue is no longer healthy. If this is the case, ""root canal"" treatment will be required. Referred pain. With this type of pain, you experience pain or sensitivity in other teeth besides the one that received the filling. With this particular pain, there is likely nothing wrong with your teeth. The filled tooth is simply passing along ""pain signals"" it's receiving to other teeth. This pain should decrease on its own over 1 to 2 weeks."
Allergic Reactions to Amalgam (Silver) Fillings,"'Allergic'' reactions to silver fillings are rare. Fewer than 100 cases have ever been reported, according to the ADA. In these rare circumstances, mercury or one of the metals used in an amalgam restoration is thought to trigger the allergic response. Symptoms of amalgam ''allergy'' are similar to those experienced in a typical skin ''allergy'' and include skin ''rashes'' and ''itching''. Patients who suffer amalgam ''allergies'' typically have a medical or family history of ''allergies'' to metals. Once an ''allergy'' is confirmed, another restorative material can be used.' "
Deteriorating Fillings,"'Constant pressure from chewing, grinding or clenching can cause dental fillings to wear away, chip or ''crack''. Although you may not be able to tell that your filling is wearing down, your dentist can identify weaknesses in your restorations during a regular check-up.''If the seal between the tooth enamel and the filling breaks down, food particles and decay-causing bacteria can work their way under the filling. You then run the risk of developing additional decay in that tooth. Decay that is left untreated can progress to infect the dental pulp and may cause an ''abscessed tooth''.''If the filling is large or the recurrent decay is extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to support a replacement filling. In these cases, your dentist may need to replace the filling with a crown.''New fillings that fall out are probably the result of improper ''cavity'' preparation, contamination of the preparation prior to placement of the restoration or a ''fracture'' of the restoration from bite or chewing ''trauma''. Older restorations will generally be lost due to decay or fracturing of the remaining tooth.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E.

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by. They may not be a long-term solution, but they can vastly improve your quality of life right now.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is heat rash?,"""The skin's job is to protect the inside of the body from the outside world. It acts as a preventive barrier against intruders that cause infection, chemicals, or ultraviolet light from invading or damaging the body. It also plays an important role in the body's temperature control. One way that the body cools itself is by ""'sweating'', and allowing that sweat or ''perspiration'' to evaporate. Sweat is manufactured in sweat glands that line the entire body (except for a few small spots like fingernails, toenails, and the ear canal).''Sweat glands are located in the dermis or deep layer of the skin, and are regulated by the temperature control centers in the brain. Sweat from the gland gets to the surface of the skin by a duct.'""A heat rash occurs when sweat ducts become clogged and the sweat cannot get to the surface of the skin. Instead, it becomes trapped beneath the skin's surface causing a mild inflammation or rash.""'Heat rash is also called prickly heat or miliaria.'  "
What are the causes of heat rash?,"'It is uncertain why some people get heat ''rashes'"" and others don't.""'The sweat gland ducts can become blocked if ''excessive sweating'' occurs, and that sweat is not allowed to evaporate from a specific area. Some examples of how blockage may occur include the following:''Babies'"" have immature sweat glands that aren't able to efficiently remove the sweat they produce. They can develop heat rash if they are exposed to warm weather, are overdressed, excessively bundled, or have a ""'fever''.''Heat rash may occur as a side effect of some medications (for example ''clonidine'' [''Catapres'']).'   Creases in the skin like the neck, armpit, or groin have skin touching adjacent skin, which makes it difficult for air to circulate, and prevents sweat evaporation. Tight clothing that prevents sweat evaporation. Bundling up in heavy clothing or sheets. This may occur when a person tries to keep warm in wintertime or when chilled because of an illness with fever. Heavy creams or lotions can clog sweat ducts."
What are the symptoms of heat rash in children and adults?,"'The common symptoms of heat rash are red ''bumps'' on the skin, and an ''itchy'' or prickly feeling to the skin. These are due to inflammation of the superficial layers of the skin (the ''epidermis'') and the prickly sensation is similar to the feeling of mild ''sunburn''.''The symptoms of heat rash are the same in infants and adults; however, since an infant cannot complain about the rash sensation, he or she may be fussy.'  "
Who is at risk for heat rash?,"'Newborns, infants, the elderly, and ''obese'' individuals with large areas with skin-on-skin contact areas (for example, a large overlapping area of ''abdominal fat'') are at risk for developing heat rash. They all are especially at risk if they are immobile for long periods and parts of the skin aren\'t exposed to circulating air, which results in the inability of the sweat ducts to ""breathe"" (evaporative cooling).''Heat ''rashes'' are more common in places with hot, humid, climates because people sweat more.''Intense ''exercise'' associated with lots of ''sweating'' may cause a heat rash, especially if the clothing worn does not allow adequate air circulation.' "
What does heat rash look like?,"'The appearance of the heat rash depends upon where the excess sweat is deposited in the skin.''Tiny blisters that look like small beads of sweat are seen if the sweat is blocked at the most superficial layers of the skin where the sweat duct opens on the skin surface. Called ''miliaria crystallina'', it has no symptoms other than these ""sweat bubbles.""''Classic heat rash or ''miliaria rubra'"" occurs if the sweat causes inflammation in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Like any other inflammation, the area becomes red (and therefore the name rubra = red) and the blisters become slightly larger. Because the sweat ducts are blocked and don't deliver sweat to the skin's surface, the area involved is dry and can be irritated, itchy, and sore. This rash is also called ""'prickly heat''.''Less commonly, after repeated episodes of prickly heat, the heat rash may inflame the deeper layer of the skin called the dermis, and cause ''miliaria profunda''. This rash is made up of larger, harder bumps that are more skin colored. The rash begins almost immediately after ''exercise'', and again no sweat can be found on the affected areas. Rarely, this type of heat rash may be potentially dangerous if enough skin is involved, since the lack of sweating can lead to heat-related illnesses like ''heat cramps'', ''heat exhaustion'', or ''heat stroke''.' "
Heat rash pictures, 
How is heat rash diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of heat rash is made by physical examination. Knowing that the rash appears during sweating or heat, appreciating the location on the body (in skin creases or where clothes fit tightly) and seeing what the rash looks like is enough to make the diagnosis. As with many rashes, the health care professional may look at the involved skin and because of previous experience, immediately make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for heat rash?,'Treatment for heat rash include home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' creams and sprays. Medical treatment for heat rash may involve antibiotics if the sweat glands become infected.'  
Home remedies for heat rash,"'Heat rash often resolves on its own when the skin cools. If the prickly sensation persists, ''calamine lotion'' may be helpful. Some clinicians also recommend over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or sprays.'  "
Medical treatment for heat rash,"'Heat rash resolves on its own once the skin cools, but on occasion, the sweat glands can become infected. The signs of infection include ''pain'', increased swelling, and redness that does not resolve. Pustules may form at the site of the rash. This infection occurs because bacteria have invaded the blocked sweat gland. Antibiotic treatment may be required. Chronic and recurrent heat rash may need to be treated by a health care professional or dermatologist (skin specialist).' "
How can heat rash be prevented?,"'Prevention'' is the most important treatment for heat rash. By allowing the skin to be exposed to circulating air, the potential for sweat ducts to become blocked and the glands to become inflamed decreases.''Other strategies to prevent heat rash include:' Avoid exercising in hot, humid weather Wear loose clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton Use air conditioning Keep the skin clean with frequent baths or showers to prevent sweat glands from becoming clogged Reduce the amount of overlapping skin-on-skin (fat or weight loss)"
How effective are electric fans in preventing heat rash?,"'Keeping the skin cool on hot days is an important preventive measure. Air circulation (with fans or by other methods) usually will help with skin cooling. It is important not to bundle newborns and infants too tightly so that air can get to the skin, but it also is important to keep them warm enough.''It is important to move individuals who are immobile (for example, some elderly, those with ''paralysis'', or are weak) so all parts of the body can be exposed to fresh air.' "
How can people protect their health when temperatures are extremely high?,"'The body can adapt very well in hot weather, but it takes time to acclimate. The actual temperature is just one factor when a person decides to work, play, or exercise in the heat. The ''heat index ''adds humidity to the equation since sweat cannot evaporate if the water content in the air (humidity) is high. If the air holds as much water as it can there is no place for sweat to go, and evaporation cannot cool the body.''To minimize the risk of heat-related illnesses, try to avoid working or exercising in extreme heat. Avoid ''dehydration'' and other complications by taking frequent breaks to get out of the heat, and drinking plenty of water or other fluids to replenish fluid lost through sweat.''Early signs of heat-related illnesses include ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''nausea''. It is important to get out of the heat, cool off, and rehydrate immediately to avoid severe heat-related problems such as heat exhaustion and heat ''stroke''.'""To calculate the heat index in your area,\xa0 go to the U.S. Army's Heat Index Calculator online."" "
How much water should I drink in hot weather?,"'It is hard to gauge how much water is lost through sweat, and the ''thirst'' mechanism may not be sensitive enough to remind a person to drink enough. In general, the kidneys are a good guide to whether there is enough water in the body. If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will try to hold on to as much water as possible. Decreased urine production, urine concentrated in color, and a strong ''urine odor'"" are signs that the kidneys are trying to conserve the body's water supply. Urine is clear when there is enough fluid in the body.""'In a hot environment, a person should drink enough water to make the urine clear, and make sure the body is producing sweat. Sweat and urine loss also involves ''electrolyte'' loss. Although drinking water is good, other fluids such as sports ''drinks'' should also be consumed to replace lost ''electrolytes'' to avoid other problems like ''hypokalemia'' (''low potassium''). People that are taking medications for conditions such as ''diabetes'', kidney problems, and ''congestive heart failure'' (''CHF'') need to be especially careful about their fluid intake, and discuss how to avoid hot-weather related problems with their doctor(s).' "
Should I take salt tablets during hot weather?,"'Taking salt tablets is not a good idea. While the body loses many electrolytes when it sweats, there are mechanisms in place to compensate for the loss. Usually, keeping the body hydrated with plain water is adequate but does not resupply electrolytes. Sports drinks (for example, PowerAde, Gatorade) may be reasonable alternatives if prolonged exercise or work is required in hot conditions.' "
What is the best clothing for hot weather or a heat wave?,"""Evaporation works to cool the skin only if the sweat that the body produces is allowed to evaporate. Lightweight, loose clothing allows air circulation to the body's surface and helps promote cooling. While cotton is the classic fabric that can be used, some synthetic fabrics have been developed to wick sweat from the skin, which allows the skin to be more efficient at skin or body cooling."" "
What is the prognosis for heat rash?,"'Heat rash or prickly heat tends to be selflimiting, and gets better once the skin cools and is allowed to breathe. Prevention by not allowing heat to accumulate in body areas, followed by cooling the skin are the most common ways to obtain the best prognosis for heat rash.' "
What is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of ''aging'' beginning in childhood. Affected children typically look normal at birth and in early infancy, but then grow more slowly than other children and do not gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). ' "

How common is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,'This condition is very rare; it is reported to occur in 1 in 4 million newborns worldwide. More than 130 cases have been reported in the scientific literature since the condition was first described in 1886.' 
What genes are related to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Mutations in the ''LMNA'' gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.''The ''LMNA'' gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. This protein plays an important role in determining the shape of the nucleus within cells. It is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Mutations that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.' "
How do people inherit Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The condition results from new mutations in the ''LMNA'' gene, and almost always occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.' "
What are the complications and prognosis of people with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,'Experience severe hardening of the arteries (''arteriosclerosis'') beginning in childhood. This condition greatly increases the chances having a ''stroke'' at a young age. These serious complications can worsen over time and are life-threatening for affected individuals.'

What is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of ''aging'' beginning in childhood. Affected children typically look normal at birth and in early infancy, but then grow more slowly than other children and do not gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). ' "
"What are the characteristics, signs, and symptoms of Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome?","'They develop a characteristic facial appearance including:''Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome also causes:''This condition does not disrupt intellectual development or the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and''walking''.'  prominent 
eyes,  a thin nose with a beaked tip,  thin lips, a small chin, and  protruding 
ears.  hair loss (alopecia), 
	 aged-looking skin,  joint abnormalities, and  a loss of fat under the skin 
(subcutaneous fat). "
How common is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,'This condition is very rare; it is reported to occur in 1 in 4 million newborns worldwide. More than 130 cases have been reported in the scientific literature since the condition was first described in 1886.' 
What genes are related to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Mutations in the ''LMNA'' gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.''The ''LMNA'' gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. This protein plays an important role in determining the shape of the nucleus within cells. It is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Mutations that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.' "
How do people inherit Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,"'Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The condition results from new mutations in the ''LMNA'' gene, and almost always occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family.' "
What are the complications and prognosis of people with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?,'Experience severe hardening of the arteries (''arteriosclerosis'') beginning in childhood. This condition greatly increases the chances having a ''stroke'' at a young age. These serious complications can worsen over time and are life-threatening for affected individuals.' 
"Where can I find information about diagnosis, management, or treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome?","'These resources address the diagnosis or management of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and may include treatment providers.''You might also find information on the diagnosis or management of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome in ''Educational resources'' and ''Patient support''.'

What are the techniques of programmed stimulation and entrainment?,"'Programmed stimulation and entrainment techniques are methods of setting the rhythm and rate of the ''heart''. These techniques help to gather information about the conduction system of the heart, which can further be used to guide the treatment of ''heart rhythm disorders'' (arrhythmias).''The heart has its internal electrical system to control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. During a heartbeat, the different chambers of the heart receive electrical impulses from the heart’s natural ''pacemaker'' (the sinoatrial [SA] node) that causes phasic contraction and relaxation of different parts of the heart. The normal heartbeat allows the heart to pump blood regularly and adequately to meet the body’s requirement. Faulty electrical signals in the heart lead to arrhythmias. This may cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or with an irregular rhythm. An ''arrhythmia'' may hamper the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively leading to symptoms such as:''There are several types of arrhythmias, and although their symptoms may be overlapping, each arrhythmia has a different source, cause, and treatment strategy. Programmed stimulation and entrainment techniques help in reaching to the cause of arrhythmia and accordingly help the doctor plan an appropriate management strategy.' Fatigue Fainting Breathlessness Uneasiness Chest pain Sweating"
For what conditions are programmed stimulation and entrainment techniques used?,"'Programmed stimulation and entrainment are used to evaluate the following conditions:' Tachycardia (heart rate more than normal) Syncope (fainting episodes caused by a decrease in blood pressure) in patients with structural heart disease (wear and tear in the heart due to conditions such as aging, high blood pressure, and heart attack) Risk of sudden death in patients with a history of heart attack The success of a ventricular tachycardia treatment Arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and bradyarrhythmias) Efficacy of an antiarrhythmic drug therapy Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscles)"
How will I be prepared for programmed stimulation and entrainment techniques?," To prepare you for the procedure, your doctor will familiarize you with the procedure and the possible complications, including those related to the sedation given for the procedure. You will be made aware of the requirement for bed rest after the procedure is performed. You will be provided with written home-care instructions as well. You will be asked"
Are programmed stimulation and entrainment procedures done under general anesthesia?,"'Programmed stimulation and entrainment procedures are safely performed on a conscious patient under intravenous (IV) sedation. Local anesthesia with 1% ''lidocaine'' is preferred because it does not interfere with the electrical activity of the heart (heartbeats).''General anesthesia or deep sedation may be preferred in some people in whom the expected procedural time is extensive, in whom the rhythm being investigated is hemodynamically unstable or who are unable to lie still. General anesthesia is also preferred for small children and younger adolescents.' "
Introduction to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,"'Progressive supranuclear palsy'', or PSP, is a rare neurodegenerative disease that is often misdiagnosed as '""Parkinson's""' disease because it carries similar symptoms. Because of its rarity, PSP is mostly unknown by the general public.' "
What Causes PSP?,"""PSP develops because of the deterioration of brain cells in a few small, but very important areas at the base of the brain. The most important affected area is the substantia nigra. When this area of the brain is affected by the disease, a lot of the palsy's symptoms become more visible. Research is still being conducted as to why the brain cells degenerate."" "
What Are the Early Symptoms of PSP?,"'The beginning stages of PSP include the inability to walk, falling spells, and ''stiffness''. Falls experienced by a PSP patient are often described as having a state of ''dizziness'', prior to actually falling. This ''dizziness'' description is sometimes misdiagnosed as an inner ear problem or a ''hardening of the arteries'' that are blocking blood flow to the brain.''Other common symptoms of PSP include:'   Forgetfulness Change in personality Loss of interest in usual socializing with family and friends"
What Are Some of the Later Symptoms of PSP?,"'The word ""progressive"" was included in the palsy\'s name because symptoms typically progressively worsen for a patient. After seven to nine years, PSP becomes more difficult to deal with. The disease usually causes physical imbalance and stiffness of the body to grow worse, making ''walking'' very difficult or sometimes impossible.''Problems with eyesight also occur in the later stages of PSP. Usually visual problems can become as much of an issue as impaired walking for the patient. Eyesight is most affected by the difficulty to aim the eye properly, making reading very hard. Another eyesight problem that is sometimes encountered is the inability to maintain visual contact with another person during conversation. PSP can also cause ""''tunnel vision''"", which sometimes causes problems while a person is trying to drive a car.'  "
Does PSP Affect a Person Mentally?,"'Most PSP patients eventually experience a mild to moderate degree of mental problems. With PSP, ''dementia'', or mental ''confusion'', causes a person to have a slowed thinking process or difficulty synthesizing ideas. The slowing of thoughts and thinking makes it hard for the person to hold a conversation with others or to analyze problems.' "
How Is PSP Treated?,"""There is a range of medication that can help curb PSP's symptoms.""'Sinemet'' is sometimes used because it contains levodopa, which aids in controlling shakiness and ''tremors''.''Antidepressants'' are often suggested by doctors, along with sleeping pills, to help PSP patients who are experiencing ''sleep problems''. Many ''drugs'' being developed to treat other neurological disorders are also being utilized to help treat PSP.'  "
Is There a Cure for PSP?,'There is no cure for PSP. Attention for a doctor and family of a PSP patient should be focused on keeping the person comfortable and creating the best quality of life possible.''WebMD Medical Reference' 
What is a prolactinoma (pituitary tumor)?,"'A prolactinoma is a benign tumor (called an adenoma) of the ''pituitary gland'"". A prolactinoma produces an excessive amount of the hormone prolactin. Prolactin is a natural hormone which supports a woman's normal lactation, which is the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breast. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary tumor. Symptoms of prolactinoma are caused by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues or by excessive release of prolactin from the tumor into the blood (causing a condition known as hyperprolactinemia)."" "
What is the normal function of prolactin?,"'Prolactin stimulates the breast tissues to enlarge during  ''pregnancy'"".  After delivery of the baby, the mother's prolactin level falls unless she breastfeeds her infant.  Each time the baby nurses from the breasts, prolactin levels rise to maintain milk production."" "
What is the pituitary gland?,"'Sometimes called the master gland, the pituitary gland plays a critical role in regulating growth and development, metabolism, and reproduction.  This gland produces prolactin and a number of other key hormones including:' Growth hormone, which as the name indicates, regulates 
growth; ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone) which stimulates the adrenal 
glands to produce cortisol, especially during 
stressful events (surgery, etc.) Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which signals the thyroid gland to produce thyroid 
hormone; and Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which 
regulate ovulation and estrogen and progesterone production in women, 
and sperm formation and testosterone production in men. "
Where is the pituitary gland located?,"'The pituitary gland is located in the middle of the head in a bony box that looks like a saddle and is called the sella turcica. Since the pituitary is in such a tight space, any abnormal growth can result in signs and symptoms secondary to compression of the gland. The nerves for the eyes pass directly above the pituitary gland.' "
What problems are caused by a pituitary tumor?,"'Pituitary tumors may impair or cause an increase in the production of one or more pituitary hormones. The lesion itself can damage surrounding normal tissue and thereby reduce the function of the pituitary gland (a condition called hypopituitarism).''Enlargement of the pituitary gland can also cause local symptoms, such as ''headaches'' (because of increased pressure if the fluid system bathing the brain is blocked or stimulated), or visual disturbances (because of the proximity of the pituitary gland to the optic nerves).'  "
How common is a prolactinoma?,"'Prolactinoma is one of the common type of pituitary tumors. Routine  ''autopsy'' (postmortem) studies have shown that about a quarter of the U.S. population have small pituitary tumors. About 40% of these pituitary tumors produce prolactin, but most are not considered clinically significant because they cause no symptoms or problems. Clinically significant pituitary tumors affect the health of approximately 14 out of 100,000 people (or 1 in about 7,000 people).' "
What are the types of prolactinomas?,"'Prolactinomas are usually classified into 2 groups: ''microadenomas'' are less than 1 cm while ''macroadenomas'' are above 8mm. The size may play a role in symptoms caused by local compression, and may determine the therapy of choice.' "
What causes a prolactinoma?,"'Although research continues to find causes of disordered cell growth, the sources of many pituitary tumors, including prolactinomas, still remain unknown.''Most pituitary tumors appear sporadically, meaning that no one else in the family has had a pituitary tumor. ''Some patients with prolactinomas have a ''genetic disorder'' called multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1).  MEN1 is an ''inherited'' condition characterized by a high frequency of ''peptic ulcer'' disease and abnormal hormone production from the pancreas, parathyroid, and pituitary glands.  Prolactinomas are a characteristic feature of MEN1.''A small number of people have a familial tendency to develop prolactinomas but do not appear to have MEN1.  The gene(s) responsible for such cases of prolactinoma have not yet been fully identified.' "
What symptoms are caused by a prolactinoma?,"'In women, high blood levels of prolactin usually interfere with ovulation, causing ''infertility'' and changing ''menstruation''.  In some women, periods may disappear altogether whereas in others, periods become irregular, or menstrual flow may change noticeably.  Women who are not ''pregnant'' or ''nursing'' may begin producing ''breast milk''.  Some women may experience a loss of libido (interest in sex).  Intercourse may become painful because of ''vaginal dryness''.''In men, the most common symptom of prolactinoma is ''impotence''.  Men have no reliable indicator such as ''menstruation'' to signal a problem.  Thus, many men delay going to the doctor until they have ''headaches'' or vision problems, caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the nearby nerves from the eyes.  Men may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido.  In fact, only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. As a result of later presentation, men on average, have larger prolactinomas at their presentation then women.'  "
"Aside from a prolactinoma, what else can cause prolactin levels to 
rise?","'In some people, high blood levels of prolactin can be traced to causes other than a prolactinoma. Other causes include:' Prescription drugs: Prolactin secretion in the pituitary 
is normally suppressed by the brain chemical, dopamine. Drugs that 
block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine 
stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. 
These drugs include the major tranquilizers trifluoperazine (Stelazine) and haloperidol (Haldol); metoclopramide (Reglan) 
used to treat gastroesophageal reflux and the nausea caused by 
certain cancer drugs; and less often, alpha 
methyldopa and 
reserpine 
(Harmonyl) used to control hypertension. Other pituitary tumors: Other tumors may block the flow of dopamine from the brain, which normally inhibits its prolactin-secreting cells.  Such so-called 
""mixed"" tumors arise in or near the pituitary, and include those that release excessive growth hormone (acromegaly) or stimulate cortisol production (Cushing's syndrome).  These can also cause the pituitary to secrete more prolactin. Some nonpituitary tumors: Prolactin secretion can also be 
caused by certain cancers, such as lung cancer. Hypothyroidism: Increased prolactin levels are often seen 
in people with hypothyroidism, and doctors routinely test people with 
hyperprolactinemia for hypothyroidism. Breast stimulation can modestly increase the 
amount of prolactin in the blood. Chest wall trauma (for example, an injury from a car steering wheel after an accident) can lead to 
increased levels of prolactin. Marijuana use is also a well documented cause of elevated levels of prolactin."
How is a prolactinoma diagnosed?,"'Elevations of the prolactin hormone in the body are detected by a blood test.  Prolactin blood levels are often  indicated in women with unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea), irregular menses, or ''infertility'' and,  in men with impaired sexual function or milk secretion (very rare in men).''If the prolactin level is high, thyroid function will usually be checked and questions asked about conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is the most sensitive test for detecting and measuring prolactinomas. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computer tomography (''CT scan'') also provides an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI for detection of a prolactinoma.''In addition to assessing the size of the pituitary tumor on the MRI, doctors also look for damage to surrounding tissues.' "
What follow-up tests are done after a prolactinoma diagnosis?,"'When a prolactinoma is found, other tests are often done to assess production of additional hormones from the pituitary gland.''Depending on the size of the tumor, the doctor may also request an eye exam to measure visual fields. Remember that the optic nerves run close to the pituitary gland, and any growth of this gland may lead to impingement  on the these nerves.' "
What are the goals of treatment of a prolactinoma?,"'The goals for treatment of a prolactinoma are to:''If the tumor is very large, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.' return prolactin secretion to normal,  reduce tumor size,  correct any vision abnormalities, and  restore the normal function of the pituitary gland.  "
How is a prolactinoma treated?,"'Prolactinomas are usually initially treated with medications. ''Surgery is considered if the medications cannot be tolerated, or if they are not effective.''The medical treatment may be only partially successful. In such cases, the medications may be combined with surgery or ''radiation therapy''.'  "
"What medications are used to treat
prolactinomas?","'Because dopamine is the chemical in the brain that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, doctors may treat prolactinomas with drugs that act like dopamine such as ''bromocriptine'' (''Parlodel'') or ''cabergoline'' (''Dostinex''). Both bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia (high blood prolactin levels). Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is also approved for the treatment of infertility. Treatment with these drugs is successful in shrinking the tumor and returning prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80% of cases, or four out of every five patients.''Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is associated with side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''dizziness''.  To avoid these side effects, it is important that the dose of bromocriptine be increased slowly. Transvaginal use of bromocriptine is documented as a safe alternative route for delivery if nausea is excessive. In general, side effects typically disappear while the drug continues to lower prolactin levels.''Bromocriptine (Parlodel) treatment should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist. Prolactin levels often rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every two years on a trial basis.''Cabergoline (Dostinex) is also associated with side effects such as nausea and ''dizziness'', but these effects are usually less common and less severe than with bromocriptine.  As with bromocriptine therapy, side effects may be avoided if treatment is started gradually. Recently, the use of Dostinex has been linked to ''heart'' valve problems. Many endocrinologists are using Dostinex as a last resort if bromocriptine simply cannot be tolerated. '""If side effects develop with a higher dose, the doctor may return to the previous dosage.  If a patient's prolactin blood level remains normal for six months, the doctor might consider stopping treatment.""'Medical therapy can often shrink a prolactinoma such that surgery is not required.' "
What is the surgical treatment of a prolactinoma?,"'The surgical treatment of prolactinomas involves delicately opening the brain to remove the tumor in the pituitary gland.''The results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin level as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon.  The higher the prolactin level, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin.  At best, surgery corrects prolactin levels in 80% of patients whose blood prolactin level is below 250 mg/mL.  Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range after surgery.  Drug therapy may also be started before surgery to ""debulk"" the tumor for the surgical procedure. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that in 20% to 50% of cases, the tumor will return, usually within five years.' "
How do I choose a skilled neurosurgeon?,"'Because the results of surgery are so dependent on the skill and knowledge of the neurosurgeon, patients should ask the surgeon about the number of operations he or she has performed to remove pituitary tumors, and for success and complication rates in comparison to major medical centers. Surgeons who have performed many hundreds or even thousands of such operations usually produce the best results.' "
Does a prolactinoma affect pregnancy and oral contraceptives?,"'If a woman has a small prolactinoma, there is usually no reason that she cannot conceive and have a normal pregnancy after successful medical therapy. The pituitary enlarges and prolactin production increases during normal pregnancy in women without pituitary disorders. Women with prolactin-secreting tumors may experience further pituitary enlargement and must be closely monitored during pregnancy. However, damage to the pituitary or eye nerves occurs in less than one percent of pregnant women with prolactinomas. In women with large tumors, the risk of damage to the pituitary or eye nerves is greater. If a woman has already completed a successful pregnancy, the likelihood of future successful ''pregnancies'' is extremely high.''A woman with a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to conceive with her physician so she can be carefully evaluated prior to pregnancy. This evaluation typically includes a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess the size of the tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields.''As soon as the patient becomes pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she discontinue bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex). Patients should consult their hormone specialists (endocrinologists) promptly if symptoms develop - particularly ''headaches'', visual changes, nausea,  ''vomiting'', excessive ''thirst'' or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if symptoms occur as a result of growth of the tumor during pregnancy.' "
Do prolactinomas affect oral contraceptives?,"'In the past, ''oral contraceptives'' (''birth control pills'') were thought to contribute to the development of prolactinomas. However, this notion is no longer held to be true. Patients with prolactinomas who are treated with bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex) may also take oral contraceptives. Similarly, post-menopausal ''estrogen replacement'' is safe in patients with prolactinomas who are treated with medical therapy or surgery.' "
Is osteoporosis a risk in women with high prolactin levels?,"'Women whose ovaries produce inadequate estrogen are at an increased risk for ''osteoporosis''. Hyperprolactinemia can cause reduced estrogen production. Although estrogen production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia, even a year or two without estrogen can decrease the strength of the bones. Women should protect themselves from ''osteoporosis'' by regular ''exercise'' and increased calcium intake through ''diet'' or supplementation, and by avoiding  ''smoking''.  Women may want to have ''bone density'' measurements. They may also want to discuss estrogen replacement therapy with their doctors.' "
"What is preventive mastectomy, and what types of procedures are used in preventive mastectomy?","'Preventive mastectomy (also called prophylactic or risk-reducing mastectomy ) is the surgical removal of one or both breasts in an effort to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer. Preventive mastectomy involves one of two basic procedures: total mastectomy and subcutaneous mastectomy. In a total mastectomy, the doctor removes the entire breast and ''nipple''. In a subcutaneous mastectomy, the doctor removes the breast tissue but leaves the nipple intact. Doctors most often recommend a total mastectomy because it removes more tissue than a subcutaneous mastectomy. A total mastectomy provides the greatest protection against cancer developing in any remaining breast tissue. ' "
Why would a woman consider undergoing preventive mastectomy?,"""Women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer may consider preventive mastectomy as a way of decreasing their risk of this disease. Some of the factors that increase a woman's chance of developing breast cancer include the following: """"It is important for a woman who is considering preventive mastectomy to talk with a doctor about her risk of developing breast cancer (with or without a mastectomy), the surgical procedure, and potential complications. All women are different, so preventive mastectomy should be considered in the context of each woman's unique risk factors and her level of concern. "" Previous breast cancer -- A woman who has had cancer in one breast is more likely to develop a new cancer in the opposite breast. Occasionally, such women may consider preventive mastectomy to decrease the chance of developing a new breast cancer. Family history of breast cancer -- Preventive mastectomy may be an option for a woman whose mother, sister, or daughter had breast cancer, especially if they were diagnosed before age 50. If multiple family members have breast or ovarian cancer, then a woman's risk of breast cancer may be even higher. Breast cancer-causing gene alteration - A woman who tests positive for changes, or mutations, in certain genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene) may consider preventive mastectomy. Lobular carcinoma in situ - Preventive mastectomy is sometimes considered for a woman with lobular carcinoma in situ, a condition that increases the risk of developing breast cancer in either breast. Diffuse and indeterminate breast microcalcifications or dense breasts - Rarely, preventive mastectomy may be considered for a woman who has diffuse and indeterminate breast microcalcifications (tiny deposits of calcium in the breast) or for a woman whose breast tissue is very dense. Dense breast tissue is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and also makes diagnosing breast abnormalities difficult. Multiple biopsies, which may be necessary for diagnosing abnormalities in dense breasts, cause scarring and further complicate examination of the breast tissue, by both physical examination and mammography. Radiation therapy - A woman who had radiation therapy to the chest (including the breasts) before age 30 is at an increased risk of developing breast cancer throughout her life. This includes women treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma."
How effective is preventive mastectomy in preventing or reducing the risk of breast cancer?,"'Existing data suggest that preventive mastectomy may significantly reduce (by about 90 percent) the chance of developing breast cancer in moderate- and high-risk women. However, no one can be certain that this procedure will protect an individual woman from breast cancer. Breast tissue is widely distributed on the chest wall, and can sometimes be found in the armpit, above the collarbone, and as far down as the abdomen. Because it is impossible for a surgeon to remove all breast tissue, breast cancer can still develop in the small amount of remaining tissue ' "
What are the possible drawbacks of preventive mastectomy?,"'Like any other surgery, complications such as bleeding or infection can occur. Preventive mastectomy is irreversible and can have psychological effects on a woman due to a change in ''body image'' and loss of normal breast functions. A woman should discuss her feelings about mastectomy, as well as alternatives to surgery, with her health care providers. Some women obtain a second medical opinion to help with the decision. ' "
What alternatives to surgery exist for preventing or reducing the risk of breast cancer?,"'Doctors do not always agree on the most effective way to manage the care of women who have a strong family history of breast cancer and/or have other risk factors for the disease. Some doctors may advise very close monitoring (periodic mammograms, regular checkups that include a clinical breast examination performed by a health care professional, and monthly breast self-examinations) to increase the chance of detecting breast cancer at an early stage. Some doctors may recommend preventive mastectomy, while others may prescribe tamoxifen or ''raloxifene'"", medications that have been shown to decrease the chances of getting breast cancer in women at high risk of the disease. (More information about tamoxifen and raloxifene is available in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) fact sheets, Tamoxifen: Questions and Answers, which can be found at ""'http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/tamoxifen'' on the Internet, and The Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR): Questions and Answers, which can be found at ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsQandA'' on the Internet.) ''Doctors may also encourage women at high risk to limit their consumption of ''alcohol'', eat a low-fat ''diet'', engage in regular ''exercise'', and avoid menopausal hormone use. Although these lifestyle recommendations make sense and are part of an overall healthy way of living, we do not yet have clear and convincing proof that they specifically reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. ' "
What is breast reconstruction?,"'Breast reconstruction is a ''plastic'' surgery procedure in which the shape of the breast is rebuilt. Many women who choose to have preventive mastectomy also decide to have breast reconstruction, either at the time of the mastectomy or at some later time. ''Before performing breast reconstruction, the ''plastic surgeon'"" carefully examines the breasts and discusses the reconstruction options. In one type of reconstructive procedure, the surgeon inserts an implant (a balloon-like device filled with saline or silicone) under the skin and the chest muscles. Another procedure, called tissue flap reconstruction, uses skin, fat, and muscle from the woman's abdomen, back, or buttocks to create the breast shape. The surgeon will discuss with the patient any limitations on exercise or arm motion that might result from these operations. "" "
What type of follow-up care is needed after reconstructive surgery?,"'Women who have reconstructive surgery are monitored carefully to detect and treat complications, such as infection, movement of the implant, or contracture (the formation of a firm, fibrous shell or ''scar tissue'"" around the implant caused by the body's reaction to the implant). Women who have tissue flap reconstruction may want to ask their surgeon about physical therapy, which can help them adjust to limitations in activity and exercise after surgery. Routine screening for breast cancer is also part of the postoperative follow-up, because the risk of cancer cannot be completely eliminated. When women with ""'breast implants'' have mammograms, they should tell the radiology technician about the implant. Special procedures may be necessary to improve the accuracy of the ''mammogram'' and to avoid damaging the implant. However, women who have had reconstructive surgery on both breasts should ask their doctors whether mammograms are still necessary. (More information about mammograms can be found in the NCI fact sheet, Screening Mammograms: Questions and Answers, at ''http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/screening-mammograms'' on the Internet.)

When do doctors use chemotherapy for prostate cancer?,"'Doctors may introduce ''chemotherapy'' and immune therapy if other measures fail to cure a case of ''prostate cancer''. However, unlike with other forms of ''cancer'', chemotherapy isn’t the first choice for early ''prostate cancer''.''For example, prostate ''cancer'' can sometimes be halted by removing the prostate or using ''drugs'' to tamp down male hormone production. But if surgical or medical castration prove ineffectual at controlling the prostate ''cancer'', doctors may start chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy.''Bone-targeted therapy helps a patient’s bone mass survive the chemotherapy assault and may help prevent prostate cancer ''metastasis'' to bone, the place where ''prostate cancers'' typically spread first.''The prostate is the gland in the male pelvis that wraps around the urethra and produces the fluid portion of semen. Men cannot produce offspring without a functioning prostate, and prostate cancer or some of its many types of treatments may cause ''impotence'' or ''incontinence''.' "
What is chemotherapy for prostate cancer?,"'Chemotherapy or ""''chemo''"" for prostate cancer involves the use of medications, either in pill form or by injection into the veins, which can kill or at least slow the growth of metastatic prostate cancer cells. It does not presently have a role in the treatment of early stage prostate cancer except as part of ''clinical trials''/research studies. The use of chemotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer is presently not a potentially curative treatment, but it can relieve symptoms of prostate cancer, and can prolong life. It is usually used in the setting of CRPC, castration- (medical or surgical) resistant prostate cancer.''Chemotherapy drugs work in many different ways. These drugs may damage the DNA of the cancer cells or disrupt the cells ability to divide (mitosis). These effects can cause cells to die. Not all prostate cancer cells may be sensitive to these drugs, but some may be. A ''tumor'' (a mass of cancer cells) will shrink if more cells are killed and removed than continue to grow and divide. As many normal tissues in the body also undergo the same patterns of growth and mitosis, these drugs have numerous side effects due to their effects on normal tissues.''Active chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer today include:''Although traditionally recommended for men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer, the NCCN recommended the use of docetaxel in combination with ADT and EBRT in men with high- and very-high-risk localized prostate cancer.''When these types of drugs are given to patients with prostate cancer they can help reduce ''pain'' and shrink tumors. Patients who respond to these drugs often live longer than those who do not respond.' Taxotere (Docetaxel) -- first-line chemotherapy option Carbazitaxel (Jevtana) -- option in individuals who have failed docetaxel Mitoxantrone (Novantrone)"
What is immunotherapy/vaccine therapy for prostate cancer?,"'The immune system works by trying to very specifically target infections or to attack and kill cells which are either cancerous or are not our own. The immune system attempts to eliminate these invading problems using antibodies and cells called T-lymphocytes; in cases of cancer the immune system still struggles to control the problem for many reasons. The cancer seems often to either depress or overwhelm the immune system. Immune therapies (immunotherapy) attempt to boost the capability of our immune system.''Provenge (Sipuleucel-T) is a form of immunotherapy, a ''vaccine'' therapy, used to treat prostate cancer that has metastasized. It is appropriate in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to hormonal therapy but who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. These patients may be showing a rise in PSA level after previous hormonal treatment has kept the PSA down for a long time.''Provenge therapy involves taking some of your own blood cells and growing them outside the body in the presence of a substance that is specific for prostate cancer. The cells are then given back to you by infusing them into the bloodstream. These cells can attack prostate cancer cells, and can help program other blood cells to do the same. Such treatment causes few side effects, including mild to moderate ''chills'', ''fever'', and ''headache'', and can prolong survival by several months.' "
What is bone-targeted therapy for prostate cancer?,"'Bone health is an essential component of prostate cancer treatment. Both the disease itself, as well as the treatment of the disease with ''androgen'' deprivation therapy, can have a significant impact on bone health. Several bone-targeted therapies have been approved.''The bisphosphonates are a group of drugs used to treat several conditions people can get including ''osteopenia'' and ''osteoporosis''. They also can lower elevated blood levels of calcium in people with cancer. They work by affecting cells in the bones called osteoclasts, which work to remove bone. These drugs encourage the death of the osteoclasts.''In prostate cancer they impact the course of skeletal-related events including reducing ''pain'' in the bones, and delaying the progression of bone metastases associated problems including the appearance of ''fractures'' (breaks in bones). While the bisphosphonates can affect the growth of prostate cells in the laboratory, they are presently not considered a targeted or direct-acting drug like a chemotherapy or hormonal treatment. They have also not been shown to prevent the appearance of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. Nonetheless, they are an important part of the treatment of prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.''The most potent of the bisphosphonates is called ''zoledronic acid'' (''Zometa'""). It is given intravenously. Its side effects are primarily reactions to the drug infusion. The dose of Zometa may need to be adjusted if the patient's blood tests show signs of deterioration in the function of the patient's kidneys. In addition, its use can predispose patients to serious dental conditions including what is called ""'osteonecrosis'' of the jaw, which can result in breakdown of the bone of the jaw after dental extractions. It is advised that you see your dentist and have needed dental procedures performed prior to the start of a bisphosphonate.''Denosumab (Xgeva) is a monoclonal antibody agent that inhibits the work of osteoclasts in a manner different from bisphosphonates. The medication inhibits a protein that tells the osteoclasts to remove bone. This drug is useful as a treatment for all of the conditions for which bisphosphonates are used. Given as an injection under the skin at intervals, it has a better side effect profile than the bisphosphonates. It does not require dose adjustments if kidney function deteriorates. It can still cause osteonecrosis of the jaw to occur. It is considered an important new drug in the treatment of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients. In some studies, it appears to be more effective than Zometa in delaying the initial onset of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases.' "
What should I know about prostate cancer?," The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that is a part of the male reproductive system that wraps around the male urethra at it exits from the bladder. Common problems are benign (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate called BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), acute and chronic infections of the prostate (acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis), and chronic inflammation of the prostate that is not related to bacteria (chronic prostatitis [non-bacterial]). Prostate cancer is common in men over 50 years of age, with the risk of developing prostate cancer increasing with aging. Certain populations are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer, particularly African-Americans and men with a first-degree relative, father or brother, diagnosed with prostate cancer at a younger age. Symptoms of prostate problems (and prostate cancer) include urinary problems such asdecreased force of urine stream;difficulty starting (hesitancy);the need to strain to urinate;stopping/starting of the urine stream (intermittency);frequent urination;dribbling;pain or burning during urination,erectile dysfunction;painful ejaculation;blood in urine or semen and/or deep back, hip, pelvic or abdominal pain;other symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain and lower extremity swelling. decreased force of urine stream; difficulty starting (hesitancy); the need to strain to urinate; stopping/starting of the urine stream (intermittency); frequent urination; dribbling; pain or burning during urination, erectile dysfunction; painful ejaculation; blood in urine or semen and/or deep back, hip, pelvic or abdominal pain; other symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain and lower extremity swelling. Prostate cancer screening consists of periodic laboratory testing, usually every 1-2 years, which includes a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination. Prostate cancer screening is not for everyone and the pros/cons should be discussed with a primary care provider and/or urologist (specialist who treats problems with the urinary system). A concern for prostate cancer is raised when blood testing, PSA, is abnormally increased and/or an abnormal area of the prostate is felt on a rectal examination. Prostate cancer is definitively diagnosed by removal of small cores of prostate tissue (prostate biopsies), which are then examined under the microscope by a pathologist. Treatments for prostate cancer may include observation, active surveillance, surgery (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy (external beam or placement of radioactive pellets into the prostate), hormone therapy, chemotherapy, immune/vaccine therapy, and other medical therapies that can affect prostate cancer cell growth. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer and cancer death in males; in some men, identifying it early may prevent/delay spread and death from prostate cancer."
What is prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer is cancer of ''prostate gland''. The prostate gland is a walnut-sized gland present only in men, found in the pelvis below the bladder. The prostate gland wraps around the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body) and lies in front of the rectum. The prostate gland secretes part of the liquid portion of the semen, or seminal fluid, which carries sperm made by the testes. The fluid is essential to reproduction.''Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer that develops in men and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in American men, behind ''lung cancer'' and ''colorectal cancer''. In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimated that 161,360 men will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 26,730 men will die from the disease -- though many of them had lived with the disease for years prior to their deaths.''Prostate cancer is comprised nearly always of ''adenocarcinoma'' cells -- cells that arise from glandular tissue. Cancer cells are named according to the organ in which they originate no matter where in the body we find such cells. Thus, if prostate cancer cells spread in the body to the bones, it is not then called ''bone cancer''. It is prostate cancer metastatic to the bones. ''Metastasis'' is the process of cancer spread through the blood or lymphatic system to other organs/areas throughout the body. Prostate cancer more commonly metastasizes to ''lymph nodes'' in the pelvis and to the bones.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose prostate cancer?,"""The diagnosis of prostate cancer ultimately is based on the pathologist's review of tissue removed at the time of the prostate biopsy. An abnormal PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal examination often are present and are the indications for the prostate biopsy.""'Digital rectal examination (DRE)'"": As part of a physical examination, your doctor inserts a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum and feels toward the front of your body. The prostate gland is a walnut or larger sized gland immediately in front of the rectum, and beneath your bladder. The back portion of prostate gland can be felt in this manner. Findings on this exam are compared to notes about the patient's prior digital rectal examinations.""'Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test'': The PSA blood test measures the level of a protein found in the blood that is produced by the prostate gland and helps keep semen in liquid form. The ''PSA test'' can indicate an increased likelihood of prostate cancer if the PSA is at an increased or elevated level or has changed significantly over time, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Prostate cancer can be found in patients with a low PSA level, but this occurs less than 20% of the time.''Prostate biopsy'': A biopsy refers to a procedure that involves taking of a sample of tissue from an area in the body. Prostate cancer is only definitively diagnosed by finding cancer cells on a biopsy sample taken from the prostate gland.'""The pathologist's report on the biopsy sample showing prostate cancer will contain much detailed information. The size of the biopsy core and the percentage of involvement of each core will be reported. Most importantly the prostate cancer present will be assigned a numerical score, which is usually expressed as a sum of two numbers (for example, 3 + 4) and is referred to as the ""'Gleason Score''. This characterizes the appearance of the cancer cells and helps predict its likely level of aggressiveness in the body. A Gleason score of 6 or less indicates a low grade prostate cancer, whereas scores of 8-10 indicate a high-grade prostate cancer. A new prostate cancer grading system was developed in 2014 to help assess risk and assign a Gleason grade group. This grade group is particularly useful in Gleason score 7, where the predominant cell type could be a 4 or a 3, which may impact prostate cancer risk.''The Gleason score and the extent of involvement of the biopsy core expressed as a percentage, as well as the PSA level as well as your general state of health and otherwise estimated life expectancy, all help to allow doctors to make their best recommendations for you regarding how your cancer should be treated.' Gleason grade group 1: Gleason score < 6 Gleason grade group 2: Gleason score 3+4= 7 Gleason grade group 3: Gleason score 4+3 = 7 Gleason grade group 4: Gleason 4+4 =8, 3+5 = 8 and 5+3 = 8 Gleason grade group 5: Gleason score 9 and 10"
What are the stages of prostate cancer?,"'The American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) system for prostate cancer staging is as follows:' T designations refer to the characteristics of the prostate cancer primary tumor. T1 prostate cancers cannot be seen on imaging tests or felt on examination. They may be found incidentally when surgery is done on the prostate for a problem presumed to be benign, or on needle biopsy for an elevated PSA. T1a means that the cancer cells comprise less than 5% of the tissue removed. T1b means that cancer cells comprise more than 5% of the tissue removed. T1c means that the tissue containing cancer was obtained by needle biopsy for an elevated PSA. T2 prostate cancers are those that can felt (palpated) on physical examination of the prostate gland (on digital rectal exam) or that can be visualized with imaging studies such as ultrasound, X-ray, or related studies. The prostate gland is comprised of two halves or lobes. The extent of involvement of those lobes is described here. T2a means the cancer involves one half of one lobe of the prostate or less. T2b means the cancer involves more than half of one lobe but does not involve the other lobe of the prostate. T2c means that the cancer has grown into or involves both lobes of the prostate. T3 prostate cancers have grown to the extent that the tumor extends outside of the prostate gland. Adjacent tissues, including the capsule around the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles, as well as the bladder neck, may be involved in T3 tumors. T3a means that the cancer has extended beyond the capsule (the outer edge) of the prostate gland but not into the seminal vesicles. T3b means that the cancer has invaded into the seminal vesicles. T4 prostate cancers have spread outside of the prostate gland and have invaded adjacent tissues or organs. This may be determined by examination, biopsy, or imaging studies. T4 prostate cancer may involve the pelvic floor muscles, the urethral sphincter, the bladder itself, the rectum, or the levator muscles or the pelvic wall. T4 tumors have become fixed to or invaded adjacent structures other than the seminal vesicles."
What are the treatment options for prostate cancer?,"'Treatment options for prostate cancer are many, and while this is an advantage in that prostate cancer is such a common disease in men, it can also be a cause of great ''confusion''. The following overview presents some information about these options, but it is not a complete explanation of any of these. You can find more information on treatment options in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline for Patients on Prostate Cancer for 2017 and the Physician Data Query (PDQ) web site of the National Cancer Institute, as well as information from the American Urological Association, and the American Cancer Society.''Conventional medical treatment options for prostate cancer include the following (see our in-depth articles for each of the treatments below for more detail):''Several new biomarkers have been developed in an effort to improve decision making in men considering active surveillance and in treated men considering adjuvant therapy or treatment of recurrence. These include Oncotype DX, Prolaris, and ELAVL1.''The NCCN treatment recommendations based on risk stratification are as follows:' Observation Active surveillance Surgery (radical prostatectomy [RRPX]: open, laparoscopic, robotic, perineal) Radiation therapy (external beam therapy [EBRT] and brachytherapy) Focal therapy, including cryotherapy Hormonal therapy Chemotherapy Immunotherapy/vaccine and other targeted therapies Bone-directed therapy (bisphosphonates and denosumab) Radiopharmaceuticals (radioactive substances used as drugs) Research techniques including high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and others Life expectancy < 10 years -- observation Life expectancy 10-20 years -- active surveillance Life expectancy > 20 years -- active surveillance, EBRT, brachytherapy, or RRPX Life expectancy < 10 years -- observation Life expectancy > 10 years -- active surveillance, EBRT, brachytherapy, or RRPX Life expectancy < 10 years -- observation; EBRT +/- ADT (4-6 months), +/- brachytherapy; brachytherapy Life expectancy > 10 years -- RRPX +/- lymph node dissection EBRT +/- ADT (4-6 months) +/- brachytherapy; brachytherapy EBRT + ADT (2-3 years); EBRT + brachytherapy +/- ADT; RRPX in select individuals EBRT + long-term ADT; EBRT + brachytherapy +/- long-term ADT; RRPX + lymph node dissection ADT or observation in select patients"
What is the prognosis for prostate cancer?,"""The prognosis for prostate cancer varies widely and depends on many factors, including the age and health of the patient, the stage of the tumor when it was diagnosed, the aggressiveness of the tumor, and cancer's responsiveness to treatment, among other factors."" The 5-year survival rate for most men with local or regional prostate cancer is 100%. Ninety-eight percent are alive at 10 years. For men diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 30%."
Is it possible to prevent prostate cancer?,"'For a disease as common as prostate cancer, a condition which one man in six will be diagnosed with in their lifetime, the ideal approach is to prevent men from getting prostate cancer.''Two ''clinical trials'' referred to as the Prostate ''Cancer Prevention'' Trial (PCPT) and the subsequent Reduction by ''Dutasteride'' of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial were conducted over the past two decades. These studies demonstrated that both ''finasteride'' and dutasteride (Propecia and ''Avodart''), when used in men between 50 and 75 years of age, reduced the incidence of prostate cancer by 28% and 23% respectively as compared to similar men taking a placebo.''The reduction in the overall incidence of prostate cancer was significant. The use of these drugs and their FDA-approval for ''prevention'' has been slow to come in part because of the lingering concern over the high-grade prostate cancer risk. Men in these trials got less prostate cancer if treated with these drugs, but the prostate cancers that they did get were more often high-grade (had higher Gleason scores) and thus appeared to be at risk for behaving more aggressively. Men with a family history of prostate cancer or other high risk factors, and in fact any man, should discuss the use of these drugs for this purpose.''Trials have been conducted on several ''vitamins'' and nutritional ''supplements'' and naturally-occurring compounds in an attempt to prevent prostate cancer.''Vitamin E'' and selenium were not effective in the prevention of prostate cancer in the SELECT trial. Vitamin E supplementation may have increased the incidence of prostate cancer.''Vitamin D'' and its derivatives have been studied in prostate cancer. There is no evidence that ''vitamin D'' protects against prostate cancer. The ''vitamin D'' derivative, ''calcitriol'', has some therapeutic utility against this disease, and is still under study.''Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men (after ''skin cancer''), and the third leading cause of death from cancer in men. The biology of prostate cancer is better understood today than it was in the past. The natural history of the disease and its staging have been well defined. There are numerous potentially curative approaches to prostate cancer treatment when the disease is localized. Treatment options also exist for prostate cancer that has spread. Ongoing research continues to search for treatments for metastatic prostate cancer.' Lycopene was also ineffective as a preventive agent. Pomegranate juice had no meaningful impact on prostate cancer prevention. Green tea had some early results suggestive of a possible protective effect, and a larger trial is under way."
What is focal therapy?,"'Several new and experimental therapies for ''prostate cancer'' are under study, including treatments that use ''ultrasound'', lasers, tissue-freezing ''gas'', and new ways of administering ''radiation''.''The prostate is the male gland in the pelvis that wraps around the urethra and excretes the fluid part of semen. ''Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common ''cancers'' in men.''These new methods are types of focal therapy, that is, treatment focused on the ''cancer'' cells in the prostate, rather than systemic therapy that administers medications or other treatments to the whole body with the aim of treating the prostate.' "
What types of focal therapy are available for prostate cancer?,"'Focal therapy involves ablation (a type of surgical removal) of the prostate ''cancer'' within the prostate with preservation of the surrounding healthy tissue. A number of focal therapies under investigation, but there is no basis for comparison of the efficacy of each of these therapies, given the limited data. Focal therapies being investigated include:''As many of these are considered experimental, only cryotherapy will be briefly reviewed.' cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, laser ablation, photodynamic therapy, irreversible electroporation, radiofrequency ablation, and focal brachytherapy."
"What is cryotherapy (cryosurgery, cryoablation) for prostate cancer treatment?","'Cryotherapy is a minimally invasive therapy that damages tissue by local freezing.''Cryotherapy is most frequently used as a salvage treatment after failure of ''radiation therapy''. As an outpatient, hollow needles are placed into the prostate through the perineum (the space between the scrotal sac and the anus) under image guidance. A gas is passed through the needles to freeze the prostate. Warm liquid is passed through the urethra at the same time to protect it. The needles are removed after the procedure. While potentially effective for local control of ''cancer'' in the ''prostate gland'', the side effects can be significant and include ''pain'' and the ''inability to urinate''. Potential long-term effects include tissue damage in needle-insertion areas, ''impotence'', and ''incontinence''. Cryotherapy is not currently recommend as a primary treatment for management of prostate cancer.' "
What are promising treatments under study for prostate cancer?,"'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an approach to therapy that is presently approved for use in Europe, and is under study in the U.S. It uses high intensity sound waves focused on the prostate gland to heat and thereby kill cancer cells. It should only be used as part of a research study (a clinical trial). The safety, side effects, and comparative effectiveness to surgery and radiation therapy must be established.''Clinical trials'' are research studies being conducted to evaluate new treatments for prostate cancer. These include approaches such as HIFU, as well as modifications of surgical and radiation techniques, and new ''drugs'' and immune therapy approaches.' "
How do you sign up for a clinical trial?,"'The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a group assembled from the major comprehensive cancer centers of the U.S., considers that the best care of a cancer patient is afforded by their participation in a clinical trial. Patients with prostate cancer should always ask if there is a clinical trial option for them at any point in their therapy. Clinical trial participation assures you that your treatment has been considered by numerous cancer experts and is at least as good as a standard treatment that you may receive off of a clinical trial. In addition, the results of your treatment will be carefully analyzed in anonymous fashion, and results can be used to help others.' "
What does prostate cancer feel like?,"'Difficulty with urination – frequency, weak stream, trouble getting started, etc. – is usually a first sign of ''prostate cancer''. But the early symptoms can also come from benign prostate conditions, so diagnostic testing is important.''The prostate is the gland in a man’s pelvis that wraps around the urethra and secretes the fluid part of semen. A working prostate is crucial for ejaculation and sexual intercourse.''Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common ''cancers'' in men. Age, family history, nationality, ''obesity'' and other factors determine your risk for prostate ''cancer''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer?,"'A patient with early prostate ''cancer'' is usually asymptomatic. However, prostate ''cancer symptoms'' associated with enlargement of the prostate due to prostate ''cancer'', which may occur with early and late-stage/advanced-stage disease, include the following:''Many symptoms of early prostate cancer can also be attributed to benign (noncancerous) conditions of the prostate, including''Signs and symptoms of advanced prostate cancer (late-stage prostate cancer) that has already spread from the prostate gland to elsewhere in the body (called metastatic prostate cancer) include''It is always best to find and diagnose prostate cancer at an early stage and hopefully still confined to its site of origin. At that point, treatments can cure it. When prostate cancer is widespread or metastatic, it can be treated, but it cannot be cured.' Frequent urination, during the day and/or at night Difficulty in starting (hesitancy), maintaining, or stopping the urine stream A weak or interrupted urine stream Straining to urinate Inability to urinate (urinary retention) Loss of control of urination Difficulty urinating when standing, requiring sitting during urination Pain with urination or ejaculation Blood in the urine or in the semen Abnormal rectal examination benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), or infection in the prostate gland or urinary system. a new dull, then progressively severe, pain in the bones, especially the low back; unexplained weight loss; fatigue; increasing shortness of breath while doing activities previously well-tolerated; low-impact fracture of bone(s) without a lot of trauma (or broken bone[s] from minor trauma); and swelling of the legs related to obstruction of the lymph tissue by prostate cancer."
What causes prostate cancer?,"'The exact causes of prostate cancer are not known. Several risk factors for developing prostate cancer have been identified, but which of these risk factors cause a prostate cell to become cancerous is not fully known.''For cancer to develop, changes must occur in the chemicals that make up the DNA, which makes up the genes in the cell. The genes control how the cell works, for example, how quickly the cell grows, divides into new cells, and dies, as well as correcting any mistakes that occur in the DNA of the cell to keep the cell working normally.''For prostate cancer, approximately 5%-10% of ''prostate cancers'' are due to inherited gene changes. Several inherited genes have been identified that increase the risk of prostate cancer, including''Kote-Jarai and colleagues identified that men who carry a hereditary mutation in homeobox 13 (HoxB13) have a higher than average risk of developing prostate cancer. In a systematic review and meta-analysis the investigators noted that in these men with the HoxB13 mutation, the risk of prostate cancer is also affected by a family history of prostate cancer and the year of their birth.''Gene changes may also be acquired (develop during the course of your life). These changes are not passed on to children. Such changes may occur when a cell normally undergoes growth and division. It is thought that at times during normal cell growth, risk factors may affect the DNA of the cell.' Cancer occurs when certain genes that either control the growth or death of the cell are affected, which results in abnormal cell growth and/or death. Genes are inherited (passed on from parents to their children) and thus some changes in the genes (gene mutations) that increase the risk of developing cancer may be inherited. RNASEL, BRCA 1, and BRCA 2, DNA mismatch genes, HPC1, and HoxB13."
What are the risk factors for prostate cancer?,"'Certain risk factors may predispose a person to prostate cancer. These include the following:' Age: Sixty percent of cases of prostate cancer arise in men over 65 years of age. The disease is rare in men under 40. Race or ethnicity: African-American men and Jamaican men of African ancestry are diagnosed with prostate cancer more often than are men of other races and ethnicities. Asian and Hispanic men are less likely to develop prostate cancer than are non-Hispanic white males. Family history: Prostate cancer can run in families. A man whose father or brother (first-degree relative) has or had prostate cancer is twice as likely to develop the disease. The younger the family member is when he is diagnosed with prostate cancer, the higher the risk is for male relatives to develop prostate cancer. The risk of developing prostate cancer also increases with the number of relatives affected. Nationality: Prostate cancer is more common in North America, Europe (especially northwestern countries in Europe), the Caribbean, and Australia. It is less common in Asia, Africa, and South and Central America. Multiple factors, such as diet and lifestyle, may account for this. Genetic factors: Mutations in a portion of the DNA called the BRCA2 gene can increase a man's risk of getting prostate cancer, as well as other cancers. This same mutation in female family members may increase their risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. However, very few cases of prostate cancer can be directly attributed to presently identifiable genetic changes. Other inherited genes associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer include RNASEL, BRCA 1, DNA mismatch genes, HPC1, and HoxB13. Other factors: High-fat diets (fatty foods) and diets high in red meats and fatty foods and low in fruits and vegetables appear to be associated with a higher risk of developing prostate cancer. Obesity is also linked to a higher risk of the disease. Increased calcium intake and dairy foods may increase the risk of prostate cancer."
When do doctors choose radiation for prostate cancer treatment?,"'Radiation'' is a powerful tool at doctors’ disposal to treat and even cure ''prostate cancer''.''The ''prostate gland'' wraps around the urethra in men and provides the liquid portion of semen. This gland is necessary for reproduction, and ''cancer'' or damage from ''cancer'' treatments may cause ''impotence'' and/or ''incontinence''. Using radiation to kill ''cancer'' cells may still cause side effects, but ideally they are less severe than those from surgery or other more invasive treatments.''Radiation therapy'' can be performed via external beam therapy (EBRT) or the placement of radioactive seeds into the prostate (prostate ''brachytherapy''). Radioactive ''drugs'' are called “radiopharmaceuticals” and may also be part of therapy for ''prostate cancer''.' "
What is EBRT therapy?,"'An X-ray machine uses a low energy radiation beam to take a picture of a portion of the body. Radiation therapy machines put out high energy beams that can be focused very precisely to deliver treatment to a site. The radiation does not ""''burn'' out"" the cancer, but damages the cells\' DNA, which causes the cancer cells to die. This process can take some time to occur after the radiation treatments have been given.''The radiation passes directly through the tissues in EBRT. Radiation treatment used today delivers very little energy to normal tissues. It just passes through. Most of the energy is able to be focused and delivered directly to the area of the prostate gland containing cancer. This process minimizes damage to healthy tissue.''EBRT can be administered in a variety of different ways including 3-D CRT, IMRT, and others. EBRT is classically administered in brief daily treatments, 5 days a week over several weeks. While the radiation does not remain in the body with this approach, the effect of the daily fractions is cumulative. Newer forms of EBRT using machines called CyberKnife allow the treatment to be completed in shorter periods of time.''A recently popular technique of EBRT is called proton beam radiation, which can theoretically more closely focus on the area being treated. Proton beam radiation therapy is more expensive. Its side effects presently appear similar to those discussed for standard radiation therapy, except for an increased incidence of gastrointestinal side effects with Proton beam radiation. Studies comparing the effectiveness and overall results of conventional radiation therapy versus proton beam therapy have not been completed yet.''Radiation therapy to the prostate gland by external beam technique may cause ''fatigue'' and bladder and/or rectal irritation. One may experience frequency of urination or stools and ''blood in the urine'' or stools. These effects are usually temporary but may recur or persist long after treatments are finished. Radiation damage to adjacent tissues can cause skin irritation and local ''hair loss''. Delayed onset of ''impotence'' can occur after radiation therapy due to its effect on normal tissues, including nerves adjacent to the prostate. Radiation therapy may be given alone or in combination with hormonal therapy, which can also shrink up the prostate gland, thereby reducing the size of the radiation area or field that needs to be treated. The NCCN guidelines recommend that patients with high-risk and very-high-risk prostate cancer receive neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ''hormone therapy'' (''androgen'' deprivation therapy [ADT]) for a total of 2-3 years if the overall health of the patient permits and that patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer be considered for 4-6 months of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant hormone therapy (ADT). Pelvic ''lymph node'' radiation may be considered for high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients with low-risk ''prostate cancers'' should not receive ADT or lymph node radiation.''EBRT is appropriate for men who are candidates for radical ''prostatectomy'' but do not wish to undergo the surgery or who are not ideal surgical candidates.''EBRT may also be used to treat recurrent prostate cancer localized to the prostate bed (where the prostate was before it was removed surgically). It is also used to treat bone metastases (spread of the prostate cancer to the bone) to reduce ''pain'' or if the cancer is pressing on important structures, including the spinal cord.' "
What is brachytherapy?,"'Brachytherapy refers to the use of radiation sources -- sometimes referred to as seeds -- placed into the prostate gland. Brachytherapy may be done with what is called low-dose rate (LDR) or high-dose rated (HDR) technique. In LDR brachytherapy, types of radioactive seeds, which only briefly put out a form of radiation that does not travel very far through tissues, are permanently implanted in the prostate gland. High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of different types of seeds or sources that give off higher amounts of more penetrating radiation. These seeds administer higher doses of radiation for longer periods of time and cannot be left in the body.''Such sources are placed in the prostate gland through surgically implanted tubes. These HDR sources are removed along with the tubes in a couple of days. In LDR brachytherapy, the seeds are placed in the operating room using image guidance to ensure the seeds go into the right places -- 40-100 seeds may be placed. With LDR, you can go home shortly after you wake up after the procedure. In HDR, you must stay at the hospital for a few days. If the prostate gland is large, hormonal treatment (ADT) may be used to shrink the gland before the brachytherapy is done. Brachytherapy may also be combined with external beam radiation therapy to further increase the dose of radiation therapy given to the prostate gland.''Brachytherapy can cause some ''blood in the urine'' or semen. It can cause a feeling similar to ''constipation'' due to the swelling of the prostate gland. One can also experience transient troubles urinating, called ''urinary retention'', related to swelling of the prostate gland, that may require short-term catheter placement. It can also make you feel that you want to move your bowels more often. There may be some long-term problems with irritation of the rectum, ''difficulty urinating'' due to ''scar tissue'' formation, and even delayed-onset ''impotence''.''The NCCN guidelines version 2.2017 indicate that brachytherapy can be used as a single therapy (monotherapy) in patients with low-risk ''cancers'' and select individuals with low-volume intermediate risk cancers. Intermediate-risk ''prostate cancers'' can be treated by a combination of brachytherapy and EBRT +/- 4-6 months of neoadjuvant, concomitant/adjuvant ADT.''High-risk patients can be treated with a combination of EBRT and brachytherapy +/- 2-3 years of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ADT.''Patients with a very large prostate or very small prostate, those with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction, or who have had a previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) are more difficult to treat and have a greater risk of side effects.''Brachytherapy can be used as a salvage therapy for recurrent/persistent prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The risk of side effects is increased when used as a salvage therapy.' "
What are radiopharmaceuticals?,"'The use of substances that are radioactive as a treatment for bone metastases has been tried for years. Strontium-89 and samarium-153 have been used in the past. They decrease ''pain'' in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases but they do not prolong life; these medications lower levels of healthy blood cells in patients who receive them.''Recently a form of radium called Ra-223 (''Xofigo'') has been approved for use in prostate cancer patients with metastases to bone but not to other internal organs. Radium is like calcium and it migrates to bone where it acts locally. As an alpha emitter, radiation from radium does not travel far enough in the body to damage other healthy tissues. Unlike the bisphosphonates, the use of this agent reduces pain and can prolong survival. It is administered by an injection into a vein. It can cause ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', and low blood counts.' "
When do doctors consider surgery for prostate cancer?,"'Radical ''prostatectomy'', or surgical removal of the entire ''prostate gland'', isn’t typically the first choice in ''prostate cancer'' treatment, but sometimes a radical approach is necessary to keep the ''cancer'' from metastasizing.''Cancer of the prostate'', the male gland in the pelvis that produces the fluid part of semen, is one of the most common ''cancers'' in men. Because it’s so common and tends to be slower-growing than many other kinds of ''cancer'', there are a variety of radiological, ''chemotherapy'', immunotherapy and other non-invasive treatments that have shown success in stopping ''prostate cancer''’s progression.''Some cases are too severe or diagnosed too late for ''drugs'' or ''radiation'' to have much effect, however. In these cases, treatment teams may opt for a radical prostatectomy, despite potential side effects like ''impotence'' and ''incontinence''.' "
What do they do to remove your prostate?,"""The removal of the entire prostate gland and the urethra that runs through the prostate and the attached seminal vesicles is referred to as a radical prostatectomy. A variety of approaches are available for performing this procedure. The type of approach may vary with your surgeon's preference, your physique, and medical conditions. Traditionally, radical prostatectomy was performed through an incision that extended from below the ""'belly button'' (umbilicus) down to the pubic bone or through an incision underneath the scrotum (perineal approach). In an effort to decrease the chance of complications or bad outcomes from the procedure, laparoscopic approaches to performing a radical prostatectomy were developed. The use of the robot to perform the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, is currently the most common method to perform a radical prostatectomy. Compared to open radical prostatectomy, robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is associated with less postoperative discomfort and sooner return to full activity, as well as less intraoperative blood loss with comparable outcomes regarding urinary continence and erectile function. Radical prostatectomy is an appropriate treatment option for those individuals with clinically localized prostate ''cancer'' that can be removed completely surgically and who have a life expectancy of 10 or more years and have no medical contraindications to surgery.''In some men, a pelvic ''lymph node'' dissection may be recommended depending on the staging or the ''Gleason score'', PSA, and radiologic findings. This involves removing ''lymph nodes'' in the pelvis that are common sites for prostate cancer to spread. This may be performed at the time of the radical prostatectomy or rarely as a separate procedure prior to definitive therapy.' "
What are the side effects of radical prostatectomy?,"'Side effects of radical prostatectomy may have a significant impact on quality of life. Thus, it is essential that you discuss with your surgeon prior to the surgery the risk of such side effects occurring, as well as treatments that can occur after surgery to treat such sides effects.''Erectile dysfunction'' is a side effect of radical prostatectomy. The risk of developing ''erectile dysfunction'' varies with your age, erectile function status prior to surgery, and the need to remove one, both, or neither of the pelvic nerve bundles during the radical prostatectomy. The pelvic nerve bundles lie on either side of the prostate, just outside the capsule or outer edge of the prostate. The pelvic nerve bundles are involved in the erectile process, the ability to have an erection. ''Impotence'', or the inability to have and sustain an erection of a quality sufficient for successful intercourse, can occur after radical prostatectomy due to ''trauma'', damage, or removal of the pelvic nerve bundles. Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy can be performed in select individuals with lower risk prostate cancer. Even after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, one may experience transient erectile troubles related to reversible trauma to the nerves during surgery. Specialists treating ''erectile dysfunction'' may recommend penile rehabilitation therapy in hopes of helping the nerves recover their function better and faster after radical prostatectomy.''Urinary incontinence'' is another risk after radical prostatectomy. The radical prostatectomy involves the removal of a portion of the urethra, which passes through the prostate gland. During the procedure, the urethra is sewn back to the bladder. When the prostate gland is removed, there may be some trauma to the sphincter around the urethra, which helps prevent leakage of urine. As with the risk of erectile troubles, the risk of incontinence may vary with your continence status prior to surgery, whether or not you have had prior surgery on the prostate (transurethral prostatectomy [TURP]) and the function of your sphincter muscle prior to surgery.''Both erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are treatable conditions. The treatment for either may involve medical and/or surgical therapies. You should discuss such risks and the treatment of these with your surgeon prior to surgery.' "
Other risks of prostate removal,"'Other risks of radical prostatectomy include infection, bleeding, discomfort, and ''blood clots'' (deep venous thrombosis [''DVT'']) and rarely death. To help prevent a ''DVT'', you may be asked to wear special compression devices on your legs or be administered a blood thinner.''Radical prostatectomy is rarely performed as a salvage procedure after other primary therapy, such as ''radiation therapy'', has failed. The risk of complications, such as, erectile dysfunction, incontinence, bleeding, and stricture, are greater with salvage therapy.' "
What is screening?,"'Cancer screening'' looks for a hidden ''cancer'' before a person has any warning signs or symptoms. This can help find ''cancer'' at an early stage. When abnormal tissue or ''cancer'' is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread. ''Scientists are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done. ''It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no ''cancer symptoms''. Screening tests may be repeated on a regular basis. ''If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests. ' "
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.,"'The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system located just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The ''prostate gland'' produces fluid that makes up part of semen. ''Anatomy of the male reproductive and urinary systems, showing the prostate, testicles, bladder, and other organs.''As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with urination. Rarely, this may cause problems with sexual function as well. This condition is called ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' or of other problems in the prostate may be similar to symptoms of ''prostate cancer''. ''Normal prostate and ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An ''enlarged prostate'' presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.' "
How common is prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer'' is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States.''Prostate cancer is found mainly in older men. Although the number of men with prostate cancer is large, most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.' "
What are prostate cancer risk factors?,"'Age, race, and family history of prostate cancer can affect the risk of developing prostate cancer.'""Anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease is called a risk factor. Risk factors for prostate cancer include the following: "" Being 50 years of age or older. Being black. Having a brother, son, or father who had prostate cancer. Eating a diet high in fat or drinking alcoholic beverages."
What tests are used to screen for prostate cancer?,"'Some screening tests are used because they have been shown to be helpful both in finding ''cancers'' early and decreasing the chance of dying from these cancers. Other tests are used because they have been shown to find cancer in some people; however, it has not been proven in ''clinical trials'' that use of these tests will decrease the risk of dying from the cancer for which a person is being screened. '""Scientists study screening tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes symptoms) decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, finding and treating the disease at an early stage may result in a better chance of recovery. ""'Screening tests for prostate cancer continue to be under study. Decisions about undergoing screening for prosate cancer should be discussed one on one with a doctor. One may wish to participate in the study of screening tests for prostate cancer. These studies are called clinical trials. There are clinical trials taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the ''NCI Web site''. ''Tests to detect (find) prostate cancer that are being studied include the following'': ''Digital rectal exam (DRE) is an exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel the prostate for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. ''Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the prostate to check for anything abnormal.''A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a test that measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made mostly by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. The level of PSA may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (BPH; an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate). ''Scientists are studying the combination of PSA testing and digital rectal exam as a way to get more accurate results from the screening tests. ' "
What are the risks of prostate cancer screening tests?,"'Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer. ''Finding prostate cancer may not improve health or help a man live longer.''Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have cancer that has already spread to the area outside of the prostate or to other places in your body. ''Some cancers never cause symptoms or become life-threatening, but if found by a screening test, the cancer may be treated. Finding these cancers is called overdiagnosis. It is not known if treatment of these cancers would help you live longer than if no treatment were given, and treatments for cancer, such as surgery and ''radiation therapy'', may have serious side effects.''Some studies of patients with prostate cancer showed these patients had a higher risk of death from cardiovascular (''heart'' and blood vessel) disease or ''suicide''. The risk was greatest the first year after diagnosis.''If a ''PSA test'' is higher than normal, a biopsy of the prostate may be done. Complications from a biopsy of the prostate may include ''fever'', ''pain'', ''blood in the urine'' or semen, and ''urinary tract infection''. Even if a biopsy shows that a patient does not have prostate cancer, he may worry more about developing prostate cancer in the future. ''Screening test results may appear to be normal even though prostate cancer is present. A man who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if he has symptoms. '""Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause ""'anxiety'' and is usually followed by more tests, (such as biopsy) which also have risks. ''Your doctor can advise you about your risk for prostate cancer and your need for screening tests. ' "

How is prostate cancer staged?,"'Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common types of ''cancer'' that develops in men and is the second leading cause of ''cancer'' deaths in American men, behind ''lung cancer'' and just ahead of ''colorectal cancer''. The prognosis for ''prostate cancer'', as with any ''cancer'', depends on how advanced the cancer has become, according to established stage designations.''The ''prostate gland'' is a walnut-sized gland present only in men, found in the pelvis below the bladder. The prostate gland wraps around the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body) and lies in front of the rectum. The prostate gland secretes part of the liquid portion of the semen, or seminal fluid, which carries sperm made by the testes. The fluid is essential to reproduction.''The term to stage a cancer means to describe the evident extent of the cancer in the body at the time that the cancer is first diagnosed.''Prostate cancer is comprised nearly always of ''adenocarcinoma'' cells -- cells that arise from glandular tissue. Cancer cells are named according to the organ in which they originate no matter where in the body we find such cells.' Clinical staging of prostate cancer is based on the pathology results, physical examination, PSA, and if appropriate, radiologic studies. The stage of a cancer helps doctors understand the extent of the cancer and plan cancer treatment. Knowing the overall results of the different treatments of similarly staged prostate cancers can help the doctor and patient make important decisions about choices of treatment to recommend or to accept. If prostate cancer cells spread in the body to the bones, it is labeled prostate cancer metastatic to the bones, not bone cancer. Metastasis is the process of cancer spread through the blood or lymphatic system to other organs/areas throughout the body. In the late stages of the disease, prostate cancer more commonly metastasizes to lymph nodes in the pelvis and to the bones."
What are the stages of prostate cancer?,"'Cancer staging is first described using what is called a TNM system. The ""T"" refers to a description of the size or extent of the primary, or original, ''tumor''. ""N"" describes the presence or absence of, and extent of spread of the cancer to lymph nodes that may be nearby or further from the original tumor. ""M"" describes the presence or absence of metastases -- usually distant areas elsewhere in the body other than regional (nearby) lymph nodes to which the cancer has spread. ''Cancers'"" with specific TNM characteristics are then grouped into stages, and the stages are then assigned Roman numerals with the numerals used in increasing order as the extent of the cancer being staged increases or the cancer prognosis worsens. Prognosis is finally reflected by considering the patient's PSA score at presentation as well as their ""'Gleason score'' (the grading system used to determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer) in assigning a final stage designation.''The American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) system for prostate cancer staging is as follows:''Traditionally, advanced prostate cancer was defined as disease that had widely metastasized beyond the prostate, the surrounding tissue, and the pelvic lymph nodes and was incurable. However, a more contemporary definition includes patients with lower grade disease with an increased risk of progression and/or death from prostate cancer in addition to those with widely metastatic disease.''The National Cancer Institute and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on prostate cancer version 2.2017 indicate the following:''CT scan'' is used for the initial staging in select patients including''Bone scan'' is recommended in the initial evaluation of patients at high risk for skeletal metastases including''N designations refer to the presence or absence of prostate cancer in nearby lymph nodes, including what are referred to as the hypogastric, obturator, internal and external iliac, and sacral nodes.''M refers to the presence or absence of prostate cancer cells in distant lymph nodes or other organs. Prostate cancer that has spread through the bloodstream most often first spreads into the bones, then into the ''lungs'' and ''liver''.' T designations refer to the characteristics of the prostate cancer primary tumor. T1 prostate cancers cannot be seen on imaging tests or felt on examination. They may be found incidentally when surgery is done on the prostate for a problem presumed to be benign, or on needle biopsy for an elevated PSA. T1a means that the cancer cells comprise less than 5% of the tissue removed. T1b means that cancer cells comprise more than 5% of the tissue removed. T1c means that the tissue containing cancer was obtained by needle biopsy for an elevated PSA. T2 prostate cancers are those that can felt (palpated) on physical examination of the prostate gland (on digital rectal exam) or that can be visualized with imaging studies such as ultrasound, X-ray, or related studies. The prostate gland is comprised of two halves or lobes. The extent of involvement of those lobes is described here. T2a means the cancer involves one half of one lobe of the prostate or less. T2b means the cancer involves more than half of one lobe but does not involve the other lobe of the prostate. T2c means that the cancer has grown into or involves both lobes of the prostate. T3 prostate cancers have grown to the extent that the tumor extends outside of the prostate gland. Adjacent tissues, including the capsule around the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles, as well as the bladder neck, may be involved in T3 tumors. T3a means that the cancer has extended beyond the capsule (the outer edge) of the prostate gland but not into the seminal vesicles. T3b means that the cancer has invaded into the seminal vesicles. T4 prostate cancers have spread outside of the prostate gland and have invaded adjacent tissues or organs. This may be determined by examination, biopsy, or imaging studies. T4 prostate cancer may involve the pelvic floor muscles, the urethral sphincter, the bladder itself, the rectum, or the levator muscles or the pelvic wall. T4 tumors have become fixed to or invaded adjacent structures other than the seminal vesicles. T3 or T4 disease, and T1 or T2 disease and nomogram probability of lymph node involvement > 10% may be candidates for pelvic CT. A nomogram is a predictive tool that takes a set of information (data) and makes a prediction about outcomes. Standard MRI techniques can be considered for the initial evaluation of high-risk patients including T3 or T4 disease, and T1 or T2 disease and nomogram indicating probability of lymph node involvement > 10% may be candidates for pelvic MRI. T1 disease with PSA > 20, T2 disease and PSA > 10, Gleason score > 8 or T3/T4 disease; and any stage disease with symptoms of bone metastases (for example, bone pain). N0 means that there is no prostate cancer evident in the nearby nodes. N1 means that there is evidence of prostate cancer in the nearby nodes. NX means that the lymph nodes cannot or have not been assessed. M0 means that there is no evidence of spread of prostate cancer into distant tissues or organs. M1a means that there is spread of prostate cancer into distant lymph nodes. M1b means that there is evidence that prostate cancer has spread into bones. M1c means that prostate cancer has spread into other distant organs in addition to or instead of into the bones."
Stratifying prostate cancer by risk,"'The NCCN guidelines stratify prostate cancer by risk. The risk groups are based on the staging of the prostate cancer, the Gleason score, PSA, and number and extent of biopsy cores positive for cancer. The risk stratification may help decide what treatment option is best for each individual.' Very low risk: stage T1c, Gleason score ≤ 6, Gleason grade group 1, PSA < 10 ng/mL, < 3 prostate biopsy cores positive for cancer, < 50% cancer in any core, PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g Low risk: stage T1-T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, Gleason grade group 1, PSA < 10 ng/mL Intermediate risk: stage T2b-T2c, Gleason score 3+4 = 7, Gleason grade group 2 or Gleason score 4+3=7, Gleason grade group 3, or PSA 10-20 ng/mL High risk: stage T3a or Gleason score 8, Gleason grade group 4, or Gleason 9-10, Gleason grade group 5, PSA > 20 ng/mL Very high risk: stage T3b-T4, primary Gleason pattern 5, Gleason grade group 5 or > 4 cores with Gleason 8-10, Gleason grade group 4-5"
What are prostate cancer survival rates by stage?,"'Staging evaluation is essential for the planning of treatment for prostate cancer.'""Prognosis refers to the likelihood that the cancer can be cured by treatment, and what the patient's life expectancy is likely to be as a consequence of having had a prostate cancer diagnosis.""'If a cancer is cured, your life expectancy is what it would have been had you never been diagnosed with prostate cancer. If the cancer cannot be cured due to it recurring in distant locations as metastases, or recurs either locally (where it started) or in an area no longer able to be treated in a curative manner, then estimates can be made of what is likely to be your survival based again on group statistics for people who have been in the same situation.'""Nomograms are charts or computer-based tools that use complex math from analysis of many patients' treatment results.""""The prognosis for prostate cancer varies widely, and depends on many factors, including the age and health of the patient, the stage of the tumor when it was diagnosed, the aggressiveness of the tumor, and the cancer's responsiveness to treatment, among other factors."" A basic staging evaluation includes the patient examination, blood tests, and the prostate biopsy including ultrasound images of the prostate. Further testing and calculations may be performed to best estimate a patient's prognosis and help the doctor and patient decide upon treatment options. They help to estimate the likelihood of a patient surviving free of recurrence after a treatment. They also can determine the likelihood of a cancer being found confined to the prostate, or spread beyond the prostate, or into the nearby lymph glands. Your doctor will likely input the data from your staging evaluation into a nomogram in order to best counsel you regarding your treatment options. The 5-year survival rate for most men with local or regional prostate cancer is 100%. Ninety-eight percent are alive at 10 years. For men diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 30%."
Coping with prostate cancer,"'The diagnosis of cancer can cause great ''anxiety'' to the individual and his family and friends. At times, one may have troubles coping with the diagnosis, the disease, and its treatment. Searching online for information may prove overwhelming also and may not be the best resource. Ask your physician or local hospital about local resources. Often, there are local prostate cancer support groups which may help you cope with your feelings and provide local resources for more knowledge.''You may consider contacting one or more of the following organizations:''The Internet has provided access to a number of sites focusing on prostate cancer treatment and outcomes. The National Cancer Institute and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have patient information, as well as the American Urological Association.' US Prostate Cancer Foundation, American Urological Association Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Cancer Society, and Patient Advocates for Advanced (Prostate) Cancer Treatment."
How does hormonal therapy affect prostate cancer?,"'Hormonal therapy for ''prostate cancer'' depends on stopping the male hormone testosterone from interacting with ''cancer'' cells.''The prostate is the male gland in the pelvis that wraps around the urethra and produces the fluid portion of semen. ''Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common ''cancers'' in men.''Prostate ''cancer'' is highly sensitive to, and dependent on, the level of the male hormone testosterone, which drives the growth of prostate ''cancer'' cells in all but the very high-grade or poorly-differentiated forms of prostate cancer. Testosterone belongs to a family of hormones called androgens, and today front-line hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer is called ''androgen'' deprivation therapy (ADT).' "
What is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)?,"'In the past, this was accomplished by surgical castration called bilateral orchiectomy. In that procedure, the testes were both removed. Today, doctors can block the function of the testes in a controllable and most often reversible fashion with ''drugs'' that prevent the production of testosterone (medical castration). These agents can result in shrinkage of the ''prostate gland'', can stop prostate cancer cells from growing for up to several years, and can relieve ''pain'' caused by prostate cancer that has spread or metastasized into the bones by shrinking the cancer. The use of ADT does not produce a cure. Over time, the prostate cancer cells will develop an ability to grow despite the lack of hormones (castrate resistance). Another form of hormonal therapy is the use of androgen receptor blockers; these medications prevent testosterone from attaching (binding) to the prostate cancer cell and being absorbed into the cell where it can help the cell survive and grow.''Hormonal treatment today is primarily used in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. It may be used in conjunction with primary curative therapies (surgical and ''radiation'' based) to shrink the cancer/prostate to increase the likelihood of cure of the treatment, neoadjuvant therapy, and with ''radiation therapy'' for several years after treatment (adjuvant therapy). However, the primary role of ADT is in the treatment of widespread or metastatic prostate cancer. While it is not a curative treatment in that setting, it can both reduce symptoms and slow down the growth of the prostate cancer to prolong life.' "
What medications block testosterone for prostate cancer treatment?,"'Today medicines used to block testosterone production by the testes include:''Flutamide'' (''Eulexin''), ''bicalutamide'' (''Casodex''), ''nilutamide'' (''Nilandron''), and an even more effective form called enzalutamide (Xtandi)'': Xtandi is recommended for use only in individuals with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that is refractory to traditional ADT), including those with and without metastases. Xtandi is different than the other androgen receptor blockers in that it has three mechanisms of action:''The most common side effects of Xtandi include''Less commonly, ''seizures'' and posterior reversible ''encephalopathy'' syndrome characterized by ''seizure'', ''headache'', lethargy, ''confusion'', and ''blindness'' may occur. A newer androgen receptor blocker with a similar mechanism of action as Xtandi, apalutamide (Erleada), is indicated for use in men with nonmetastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.''Both surgical and medical castration result in ''impotence''. They also can cause ''hot flashes'', ''fatigue'', ''anemia'', and thinning of the bones (''osteoporosis'') over time. These drugs may be given individually or combined with an androgen receptor blocker in what is called a combined androgen blockade.''Other hormonal treatment options include:''Estrogen'': This female hormone has been utilized in the treatment of prostate cancer as it also results in medical castration. Its mechanism of action remains under study, and its association with a high risk of ''heart attack'' and ''blood clots'' when used in high doses has diminished the frequency of its use, particularly in front-line therapy. Other side effects include breast enlargement/''pain'' (''gynecomastia''). Estrogen and related drugs may still have a role in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in select individuals.''Adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors'': The adrenal glands, a pair of small glands that are located above the kidneys, also produce a small amount of testosterone. Individuals on traditional ADT have testicular production of testosterone suppressed but still may have testosterone production from the adrenal glands. In individuals on ADT who have continued growth of the prostate cancer (rising PSA), the use of adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors may be useful. This group includes a drug called ''ketoconazole'', which was primarily developed to treat ''fungal infections'', but has shown to be effective in the treatment of prostate cancer. More recently, an agent called abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) has been developed. It has a similar effect on androgen synthesis, but it is more powerful than an older agent called ketoconazole (''Nizoral'') and has fewer side effects. The use of Zytiga in combination with ''prednisone'' is considered in individuals failing traditional ADT and individuals who have castrate-resistant prostate cancer (failed first-line ADT). More common side effects of Zytiga include ''fatigue'', back or joint discomfort, peripheral ''edema'', ''diarrhea'', ''nausea'', ''constipation'', and ''low potassium'' levels. ''Blood pressure'', ''liver tests'', potassium, and phosphate levels should be monitored regularly when initially using Zytiga.''Steroids'': These agents including prednisone may have beneficial hormonal effects in prostate cancer, including slowing the production of androgen by the adrenal glands. They often make the patient feel better, but have many side effects including inducing or worsening ''diabetes'', fluid retention, ''cataract'' formation, ''weight gain'', and ''osteoporosis''.''Agents that block the conversion of testosterone to its active metabolite: ''Finasteride'' (''Proscar'') and ''dutasteride'' (''Avodart'') are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of prostate cancer, however, they have been used (off-label) in treating prostate cancer by preventing the conversion of testosterone to its active metabolite called DHT (dihydrotestosterone). These drugs are frequently utilized for the symptoms of ''prostate enlargement'' in men without prostate cancer and appear to reduce the risk of development of prostate cancer. Their side effects are limited. They are used in combination with other agents to optimize androgen blockade.' LH-RH agonists: Leuprolide (Lupron), goserelin (Zoladex), histrelin (Supprelin LA), and triptorelin (Trelstar) are examples of these mediations. These are either given by injection into the muscle or under the skin at varying intervals of at least 1 month or longer. LH-RH antagonists: Degarelix (Firmagon) is a monthly injection that is given under the skin. It prevents androgens (testosterone) from binding to the androgen receptor, it prevents the androgen receptor from moving into the central area (nucleus) of the cell, and it prevents binding of the androgen receptor to DNA and stimulating growth. fatigue, back pain, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, diarrhea, hot flush, upper respiratory tract infection, swelling of the legs, shortness of breath with exertion, headache, hypertension, dizziness, and weight loss."
What are the causes of prostate infection?,"'If the ''prostate gland'' becomes swollen and tender, it is called ''prostatitis'"" or prostate infection. The prostate gland is a walnut-shaped organ that lies just below a man's urinary bladder. The prostate produces a fluid that goes into the semen. An inflamed or infected prostate gland may be seen in men of all ages. While the exact cause of prostate infection isn’t known, some cases of ""'prostatitis'' are clearly related to ''bacterial infections''. Bacterial prostatitis isn’t ''contagious'' and isn’t a ''sexually transmitted disease''. Below are a few common causes of prostate infection:' Urinary tract infection Severe injury to the groin Recurrent use of a urinary catheter Prostate biopsy Pre-existing diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)"
What are the common symptoms of prostate infection?,"'There are four types of prostate infections. Each has its own symptoms:''Acute\xa0bacterial prostatitis: ''This kind of prostatitis is caused by an acute bacterial infection of the prostate. It is diagnosed by an increased presence of bacteria and white blood cells in the urine, semen, and prostatic secretion.\xa0 Symptoms include:''Severe bacterial prostatitis:'' Severe\xa0bacterial prostatitis is caused by recurring bacterial infection of the prostate; the infection does not respond immediately to antibiotics and needs further treatment.\xa0Symptoms may be the same as acute bacterial prostatitis.''Severe nonbacterial prostatitis:'' It is also called chronic ''pelvic pain'' syndrome. Patients may exhibit the same symptoms like those of severe bacterial prostatitis, but no bacteria presence is detected in urine, semen, or prostate secretion.\xa0Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis, but very little is understood about it.\xa0''Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis:'' It occurs is when the prostate is inflamed, but the patient shows no symptoms at all. Because of the lack of symptoms, this condition is often diagnosed during tests for\xa0''infertility''\xa0or\xa0elevated prostate-specific antigen\xa0(PSA) level when a large amount of white blood cells is found in ejaculation.\xa0The presence of high-level white blood cells in the semen can cause male ''infertility''.

Fever Chills Fatigue Joint and/or muscle aches  Pain in the area of the perineum, pelvis, and genitals Pain/burning with urination and ejaculation Symptoms of urinary tract obstruction such as frequent urination (especially at night), urgency (sudden strong urge to urinate), hesitancy (unable to start stream), weak stream, and incomplete voiding Lower back and/or lower abdominal pain Spontaneous urethral discharge, which is a fluid that is not urine or sperm but the product of an infected or irritated urethra Decreased sexual activity or interest"
What are the remedies for prostate infection?,"'The common remedies of prostate infection include:''Warm baths'' called sitz baths''Local heat therapy'' with hot water bottles or heating pads''Physical therapy:''Phytotherapy'': Plant extracts such as quercetin, bee ''pollen'', and saw palmetto may help in relieve symptoms.''Acupuncture''Avoiding food that triggers'' symptoms such as ''caffeine'', spicy foods, and ''alcohol''Using a cushion ''if you will be sitting for a long time' Kegel exercises: Tightening and relaxing the muscles that hold urine in the bladder and hold the bladder in its proper position. These are also called pelvic muscle exercises. Myofascial release: Pressing and stretching, sometimes with cooling and warming, of the muscles and soft tissues in the lower back, pelvic region, and upper legs. It is also known as myofascial trigger point release."
How is prostate infection treated?,"'Treatment depends on the type of prostatitis. Prostatitis is a treatable condition. Even if the problem cannot be cured, patients may usually get relief from their symptoms by following the recommended treatment.''Treatments include the following:' Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen or paracetmol Antibiotic medications may be initially started for 7-14 days; however, they may be taken longer for severe conditions. Alpha-blocking agents may improve the urinary stream and often reduce the other voiding symptoms in patients with chronic prostatitis. Alpha-blocking agents include Flomax (tamsulosin) or Uroxatral (alfusozin) for patients with voiding symptoms and those who do not empty their bladders well. Other treatments for severe noninfectious prostatitis include the drugs Proscar (finasteride), terazosin, and doxazosin. These drugs relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow and reduce symptoms."
What is the prostate gland? What does it look like?,"'The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system, and it is a walnut-sized gland found in men that is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine and semen exit the body. Its main function is to produce seminal fluid in order to transport sperm through the urethra.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of prostatitis?,"'The symptoms associated with prostatitis can vary depending on the underlying cause of prostatitis. The symptoms may appear slowly or come on quickly, and they may improve rapidly (depending on the cause and treatment available) or they may last for several months and they can keep recurring (chronic prostatitis). The rapidity and severity of onset is usually most pronounced with acute bacterial prostatitis. The following are signs and symptoms that may be present with prostatitis:'

   Painful, difficult and/or frequent urinating Blood in the urine Groin pain, rectal pain, abdominal pain and/or low back pain Fever and chills Malaise and body aches Urethral discharge Painful ejaculation or sexual dysfunction"
When should you call your doctor if you think you may have prostatitis symptoms?,"'If you have any of the signs or symptoms consistent with prostatitis, you should see your health care professional for further evaluation. Depending on the symptoms and your response to therapy, your doctor may need to refer you to a ''urologist'' (a physician specializing in the genitourinary system).' "
What causes prostatitis?,"'Prostatitis can be caused by bacteria that leak into the prostate gland from the urinary tract (the most common bacterial cause) and from direct extension or lymphatic spread from the rectum. It can also result from various sexually transmitted organisms such as ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', or ''HIV''. Other organisms responsible for infection are the same found most frequently in ''urinary tract infections'', such as ''Escherichia coli''. In many instances (especially in the chronic form of prostatitis), no specific cause of prostatitis can be found.' "
What are the risk factors for prostatitis?,"'Men of all ages can be affected by prostatitis, but it is more common in young and middle-aged men. Other risk factors for the development of prostatitis include the following:' A prior history of prostatitis Having a recent urinary tract infection Recent use of a urinary catheter or a recent urologic procedure Enlarged prostate gland Engaging in rectal intercourse Having a structural or functional urinary tract abnormality Dehydration (not enough fluids) Local pelvic trauma or injury such as from bicycle riding or horseback riding"
What tests diagnose prostatitis? What are prostate-specific antigens?,"'Prostatitis is usually diagnosed by analyzing a urine sample and undergoing an examination of your prostate gland by your health care practitioner. This examination involves a digital rectal examination to palpate the prostate gland and feel for abnormalities of the gland. Occasionally, the physician may also collect and test a sample of the prostatic fluid.''Sometimes a prostate ''massage'' is performed to compare samples of the prostatic fluid both before and after this intervention has been performed. To perform this procedure, the doctor will ''stroke''/massage the prostate gland during the digital rectal examination. Because there is the concern that this procedure can release bacteria into the bloodstream, this test is contraindicated in cases of acute bacterial prostatitis.''Additional tests that may be obtained include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), an ''electrolyte'' panel, blood cultures, a swab of urethral discharge if present, and sometimes a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. The ''PSA test'', which is used as a screening test for ''prostate cancer'', may also be elevated with prostatitis.''Other tests that may also be obtained include urodynamic tests (to check how well you empty your bladder and establish if prostatitis is affecting your ability to urinate), ''ultrasound'' imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, ''cystoscopy'', and a prostate biopsy.''If recurring episodes of ''urinary tract infections'' and prostatitis occur, see your doctor for a more detailed evaluation of your genitourinary system for anatomic abnormalities, which may make you more prone to infections.' "
What is the best treatment for prostatitis?,"'Treatment for prostatitis depends on the underlying cause and type of prostatitis. Antibiotics are prescribed if the cause is a bacterial infection. All forms of prostatitis require ''pain'' control if needed, treatment, relief of complications and side effects, and need to be closely monitored by your doctor. In certain instances, some people with prostatitis may need to be hospitalized for treatment.'

   Antibiotics: Your doctor will decide the specific antibiotic and the duration of treatment. Anti-inflammatory medications: These can help manage your pain. Alpha-blockers: By relaxing the muscle fibers around the bladder and prostate gland, alpha-blockers may decrease your urinary symptoms and help you empty your bladder."
"What natural or home remedies relieve pain, symptoms, and treat prostatitis?","'In addition to medical treatment, natural home remedies for prostatitis include:' Warm sitz baths Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. Prostate massage: In a few studies, prostate massage has been shown to decrease symptoms in some patients with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. Lifestyle changes: If you cycle or ride horses, it is recommended to suspend this activity until you improve. Although there are many herbal preparations available, there is no current evidence that herbal remedies are definitely helpful with prostatitis. Acupuncture has shown a decrease in symptoms for some people who suffer from prostatitis."
What are the complications of prostatitis?,"'There are several potential complications of prostatitis, which may include the following:''Prostatitis can elevate the PSA level. There is no evidence that prostatitis leads to prostate ''cancer''. If the acute inflammation/episode of prostatitis has resolved, the PSA level will usually return to baseline levels.'   acute prostatitis becoming chronic prostatitis, bladder outlet obstruction or urinary retention, infertility, abscess of the prostate gland, spreading of the infection to the blood stream (bacteremia/sepsis), and rarely death."
What is the prognosis for prostatitis? Does it increase the risk of developing prostate cancer?,"'Prostatitis caused by bacterial illness often can be treated with antibiotics, or the condition can be chronic that recurs and requires long-term medical attention.' Acute bacterial prostatitis can often be treated very successfully and has a very good prognosis. Chronic prostatitis, and especially chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, can often lead to long-term symptoms and discomfort if treatment is unsuccessful. It is important to have close follow-up and continued care by either your primary care doctor or a urologist. Prostatitis does not increase your risk of developing prostate cancer."
What is the prostate gland?,"'The prostate is a gland about the size of a walnut. It is part of the male reproductive system and wraps around the tube that carries urine out of the bladder. It grows larger as you get older. If your prostate gets too large, it can cause health issues. Having prostate problems does not always mean you have cancer.''Sometimes a doctor may find a problem during a routine checkup or by doing a rectal exam. If you think there is something wrong with your prostate, see your doctor right away.' "
What are common prostate problems? What are the symptoms and signs?,"'Here are some examples of non-cancer prostate problems:''Benign prostatic hyperplasia'', or ''BPH'', means your prostate is enlarged, but is not cancerous. It is very common in older men. An ''enlarged prostate'' may make it very difficult to urinate or cause dribbling after you urinate. You may feel the need to urinate a lot, often at night. See your family doctor for an exam. Treatments for BPH include:''Acute bacterial prostatitis'' usually starts suddenly from a bacterial infection. It can cause ''fever'', ''chills'', or pain. It might hurt when you urinate, or you may see blood in your urine. See your doctor right away. He or she can prescribe medicine to make you feel better.''Chronic bacterial prostatitis'' is an infection that comes back again and again. This is a rare problem that can be hard to treat. Sometimes taking antibiotics for a long time may work. Talk with your doctor about other things you can do to help you feel better.''Chronic prostatitis'', also called Chronic ''Pelvic Pain'' Syndrome (CPPS), is a common prostate problem. It can cause pain in the lower back, in the groin area, or at the tip of the penis. Men with this problem often have painful ejaculation. They may feel the need to urinate frequently, but pass only a small amount of urine. Treating this condition may require a combination of medicines, surgery, and lifestyle changes.'   Watchful waiting, also called active surveillance. If your symptoms are not too bad, your doctor may tell you to wait before starting any treatment to see if the problem gets worse. Your doctor will tell you how often you need to return for checkups. You can start treatment later if your symptoms worsen. Medications. There are medicines that can help shrink the prostate or help relax muscles near your prostate to ease your symptoms. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects. Surgery. If nothing else has worked, your doctor may suggest surgery to help urine flow. There are many types of BPH surgery. Talk with your doctor about the risks. Regular checkups are important after surgery. Other treatments. Sometimes radio waves, microwaves, or lasers are used to treat urinary problems caused by BPH. These methods use different kinds of heat to reduce extra prostate tissue."
What is PSA testing?,"'Some doctors think that men younger than 75 should have yearly PSA tests; others do not. Not all ''prostate cancers'' are life-threatening, and treatments can cause side effects. Sometimes high PSA levels can be caused by infections, BPH, or small ''cancers'' that may not grow or spread. Your doctor may prefer ""watchful waiting"" until there are signs that treatment is needed. Researchers are studying ways to improve the ''PSA test'' so that it detects only cancers that need treatment.'  "
What is prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer is common among American men. Your chance of getting prostate cancer may be affected by your:' Age. Men age 50 and older run a greater risk. Race. Prostate cancer is most common among African-American men. Family history. If your father or brother has had prostate cancer, you are more likely to have it, too. Diet. Eating high-fat food with few fruits and vegetables may raise your risk."
How is prostate cancer diagnosed?,"'At the start, prostate cancer does not cause symptoms. As the cancer grows, you may have trouble urinating. Some men need to urinate often, especially at night. Others have pain or burning during urination, ''blood in the urine'' or semen, pain in the back, hips, or pelvis, and painful ejaculation.'""To find out if these symptoms are caused by prostate cancer, your doctor will ask about your past medical problems and your family's medical history. He or she will perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will put a gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for hard or lumpy areas.""'Your doctor may also do a blood test to check the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. PSA levels can be high in men with an ''enlarged prostate'' gland or with prostate cancer. You may also need an ultrasound exam that takes computer pictures of the prostate.''If tests show that you might have cancer, your doctor will want to confirm this with a biopsy. He or she will take out tiny pieces of the prostate to look for cancer cells. Your doctor may want to do a biopsy again to re-check the results.'  "
What is the treatment for prostate cancer?,"'Treatment for prostate cancer depends on whether cancer is in part or all of the prostate or if it has spread to other parts of the body. It also depends on your age and overall health. Talk with your doctor about the best treatment choice for you. You may want to ask another doctor for a second opinion.''For cancer that has not spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, your doctor may suggest:'""Get more details on treatment choices for prostate cancer by calling the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-422-6237. Or, visit their website at www.cancer.gov/prostate.""   Watchful Waiting or Active Surveillance. If the cancer is growing slowly and not causing problems, you may decide not to treat it right away. Instead, your doctor will check regularly for changes in your condition. Surgery. The most common type of surgery removes the whole prostate and some nearby tissue. As with any surgery, there are risks. Talk to your doctor about problems that may result from surgery. Radiation Therapy. This treatment uses radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. The radiation may come from an x-ray machine or from tiny radioactive seeds placed inside or near the tumor. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects. Hormone Therapy. Men having other treatments like radiation therapy may also be treated with drugs to stop the body from making testosterone. This is done if it seems likely that the cancer will come back. Hormone therapy can also be used for prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate."
How can you protect yourself against prostate problems?,"'Remember that the following can be signs of a prostate problem:''If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.'   Frequent urge to urinate Need to get up many times during the night to urinate Blood in urine or semen Painful or burning urination Not being able to urinate Painful ejaculation Frequent pain or stiffness in lower back, hips, pelvic or rectal area, or upper thighs Dribbling of urine"

What is a PSA test?,"'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a substance produced only by certain cells within the male prostate gland. Biochemically, it belongs to the protease family of kallikrein and is also known as human kallikrein 3 (hK3). PSA is released by the prostate into the semen where it acts to liquefy the semen following ejaculation. Most of the PSA produced by the prostate gland is carried out of the body in semen, but a very small amount escapes into the bloodstream, so PSA is normally found in low amounts (nanograms per milliliter or ng/mL) in the blood. PSA has also been found in some breast tissue in women, although these amounts of PSA are very low.''If the PSA level is high for your age or is steadily increasing (with or without an abnormal physical exam), further investigation, namely a prostate biopsy, may be recommended. The health care provider should consider other health risk factors of prostate cancer such as family history, prostate volume, the presence of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), urinary symptoms, rectal exam findings, ethnicity, and medications that you are taking before recommending the biopsy. At this time, prostate biopsy for pathology review is the only way to determine if prostate cancer or other abnormal cells are present in the prostate.' "
How is the PSA count measured?,"'PSA is measured by a simple blood test that does not require fasting or special preparation. Since the amount of PSA in the blood is very low, detection of it requires a very sensitive type of technology (monoclonal antibody technique). The PSA protein can exist in the blood by itself (known as free PSA) or be bound with other substances (known as bound or complexed PSA). PSA is mostly bound to three substances: alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), and albumin. Total PSA is the sum of the free and the bound forms. The total PSA is what is measured with the standard PSA test. More recently, a precursor of PSA, proenzyme PSA ([-2] proenzyme PSA), has been identified, which may be helpful in determining prostate cancer risk in men with a PSA under 10 and a normal digital rectal examination. The prostate health index (PHI) is a new approved test that measures the total PSA, free PSA, and [-2] proenzyme PSA. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines include use of PHI as a secondary test option for men making decisions about an initial or repeat biopsy. The 4K score test is another test that incorporates PSA. The 4K score uses a prediction model based on clinical variables (age, prior biopsy, digital rectal examination results) and laboratory measurements of total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and a related protein known as hK2 (human kallikrein-related peptidase 2).' "
What causes elevated PSA levels?,"'It is believed that elevation of PSA in the blood is due to its release into the circulation (bloodstream) because of a breakdown (disruption) of the prostate cellular architecture (structure). However, the reasons are not fully known. A high PSA level can occur in the setting of different prostate diseases/conditions including prostate cancer but also as a result of noncancerous causes. It is important to note that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer but to prostatic tissue, and therefore PSA elevations may indicate the presence of any kind of prostate disease. Common benign causes of PSA elevation include ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' or BPH (an age-related, natural enlargement of the prostate, secondary to a noncancerous growth of prostate glandular cells), ''prostatitis'' (inflammation or infection of the prostate), and ''urinary tract infection''. In fact, PSA elevation can also occur with prostate manipulation such as ejaculation, prostate examination (digital rectal examination), medical instrumentation (cystoscopy), ''urinary retention'' or Foley catheter placement, and prostate biopsy. It is also thought that vigorous ''exercise'' that may affect the prostate, such as bicycle riding, can increase the PSA. It is for these reasons that patients should abstain from sex one to two days prior to PSA testing. Some physicians may recommend repeating a PSA test to ensure that the elevation is not related to these noncancerous causes.' "
What can lower the PSA test results?,"'Medications commonly taken to treat benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) such as ''finasteride'' (''Proscar''), ''dutasteride'' (''Avodart''), and a combination of dutasteride and ''tamsulosin'' (Jalyn) can decrease the PSA by about 50% within six to 12 months of starting their use. Another medication used to treat ''fungal infections'', ''ketoconazole'', can also lower PSA levels. Lastly, herbal ''supplements'' such as saw palmetto and those containing phytoestrogens, which are plant-derived chemicals with estrogen-like effects, can also lower the PSA level. It is important to tell your health care provider all the medications, both prescription and nonprescription, as well as any herbal preparations or health ''supplements'' that you are taking.' "
What is the accuracy of the PSA test?,"'One of the limitations of the PSA test is that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer and that it can be affected by several common conditions such as benign enlargement of the prostate, inflammation, and infection of the prostate. Furthermore, there is some variability in PSA results when using different testing equipment. One study showed that 25% (one in four) men who had an initial PSA result between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL had a normal test result when it was repeated.''Limitations of PSA testing include a high false-positive rate (a test that incorrectly indicates that a particular condition is present). In fact, only about 25% of men who have an elevated PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL will have prostate cancer identified on prostate biopsy and 75% will not. If one uses a lower cutoff of 3.1 ng/mL, PSA had a sensitivity (the proportion of men who test positive for the condition among those that have the condition) of 32% and specificity (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as negative) of 87% for identifying prostate cancer.''Another concern in addition to the low specificity in detecting the presence of prostate cancer is the inability of the test to discriminate between a more aggressive, high-risk, prostate cancer from one that is less likely to cause harm, or a low-risk prostate cancer. This is thought to lead to overtreatment in up to 50% of men with prostate cancer.' "
What are normal results for the PSA test?,"'The ""normal"" PSA serum concentration remains a debate, however, for most laboratory readings, it should be less than 4.0 ng/mL. The prostate gland generally increases in size and produces more PSA with increasing age, so it is normal to have lower levels in young men and higher levels in older men. Due to these normal changes in PSA with age, the concept of age-adjusted PSA normals have been described and recommended. What is considered to be a normal PSA level also depends on ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. Once an initial PSA has been obtained, the change in the PSA over time, the PSA velocity, plays a role in clinical decision making. It is felt that the PSA velocity over a year should be less than 0.75 ng/mL. For example, a man 50 to 59 years of age with a PSA level that is 0.5 ng/mL one year and increases to 2.5 ng/mL the following year, may be viewed as having a normal PSA level, but the rate of change in his PSA (PSA velocity) would be worrisome for an underlying prostate cancer. Lastly, as the size of the prostate gland may affect the PSA level, PSA density (PSA level divided by prostate volume) can also be a helpful number. A PSA density of 0.18 or less appears to be an optimal number.'  "
What are age-specific reference ranges for serum PSA?,"'The use of age-specific PSA ranges for the detection of prostate cancer is helpful to avoid unnecessary investigations in older men with larger prostate glands (typically walnut-sized). Median PSA value for men aged 40 to 49 years is 0.7 ng/mL and for men 50 to 59 years is 0.9 ng/mL. Not all studies have agreed that this is better than simply using a level of 4.0 ng/mL as the highest normal value. Nevertheless, due to the age-related growth of the prostate, the concept of adjusting the cutoff values based on age has helped reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in older men to improve early prostate cancer detection. Below are the suggested age-adjusted values based on age and race.' "
How is PSA used for early detection of prostate cancer?,"'Clinically localized prostate cancer (prostate cancer confirmed to the prostate gland) generally does not usually cause any symptoms. In general, most men with organ-confined (early, localized) ''prostate cancers'' have PSA values that are typically less than 20 ng/mL. Once PSA values are greater than 20 ng/mL, the risk for metastatic (distant spread) disease increases significantly. Men with early prostate cancer usually feel perfectly well and have no urinary symptoms related to the prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of prostate cancer cells in a prostate biopsy specimen, elevated PSA remains the most common indication for prostate biopsy. An abnormal prostate on digital rectal examination is also an indication for prostate biopsy, and thus ''prostate cancer screening'' should not be solely PSA-based.''It is the hope that the ability to identify changes like increases in PSA or abnormalities on rectal examination will allow for early detection of prostate cancer and allow for close monitoring (active surveillance) or definitive treatment to prevent the development of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-related deaths. However, given the sensitivity of PSA testing, the trade-off of evaluating those individuals with an elevated PSA is the possibility of an unnecessary prostate biopsy and associated risks (infection, ''blood in the urine''/ejaculate) and ''anxiety''. In addition, current ''prostate cancer screening'' is limited by its ability to identify individuals with high-risk prostate cancer, prior to prostate biopsy.''Limitations with PSA testing have led to a search for alternative biomarkers. More recently, other novel biomarkers and tests (PCA3, 4K, PHI, as well as prostate ''MRI'' imaging) have emerged as additional adjuncts to patient counseling. Unfortunately, none can confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Nor can these tests, including PSA, allow one to predict prior to biopsy if an individual has an aggressive form of prostate cancer.''Although not perfectly specific as a biomarker, the level of PSA has been demonstrated to be an independent variable to predict the presence of prostate cancer. In fact, the higher the level, the more likely prostate cancer is present. An abnormality in results will usually require additional testing. However, definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer depends on the presence of cancer cells obtained either from prostate biopsy or surgical specimens.''In general, PSA levels greater than 4 ng/mL are usually considered suspicious. As levels increase above 10.0 ng/mL, the probability of cancer increases dramatically. However, not all men with prostate cancer have elevated PSA levels. It is known that a small but significant number of people with prostate cancer can present with a PSA level of less than 4.0 ng/mL. This is why health care professionals may use lower thresholds to decide when to do a biopsy, depending on the presence of risk factors (for example, family history of prostate cancer, ethnicity) and other factors such as PSA density and PSA velocity.''For an average man over the age of 50 with a normal digital rectal exam, the average probability of having prostate cancer detectable by prostate biopsy according to his PSA level is as follows:''Since the likelihood of having prostate cancer increases proportionately with PSA level, there is no threshold below which a man can be reassured that prostate cancer is not present.''In order to improve the specificity of the PSA test in the early detection of prostate cancer, several modifications of the serum PSA value have been described including the ratio of free/total PSA and the measurement of PSA change over time.' "
What is the cost of the PSA test?,"""The PSA blood test is frequently covered by insurance, especially for men who are 50 years of age and older. PSA blood tests costs $20-$50. However, if it is obtained in the doctor's office during a visit to the doctor there may be an additional charge of $25-$100 for the office visit. There are PSA blood tests available for home use. The home blood test comes with a lancet to prick your finger and squeeze out a sample of blood, a kit to collect the blood, a bandage, and an address or prepaid mailer to return to the laboratory. Not all of the advertised home blood tests are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You can access the FDA web site to make sure you are using an approved test."" "
What is free/total PSA ratio?,"'Although prostate cancer cells do not produce more PSA than benign prostate tissue, the PSA produced from cancerous cells appears to escape an enzymatic processing that cleaves the bond between PSA and the protein that binds to it. Therefore, men with prostate cancer have a greater fraction of complexed, or bound, serum PSA and a lower amount of unbound (free) PSA compared with men without prostate cancer. Therefore, the free/total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) can be additionally used in clinical practice to discriminate between PSA elevation secondary to benign prostatic disease and ''prostate cancers''. This is particularly useful for patients with a total PSA level between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a negative normal rectal exam to help the health care provider to decide if a biopsy is necessary. In one study, prostate cancer was found in 56% of men with a free/total PSA less than 0.10 (10%) but in only 8% of men with free/total PSA greater than 0.25 (25%). Nevertheless, the concept of free PSA must be used with caution as several factors may influence the free/total PSA ratio such as temperature and prostate size. Furthermore, the free PSA measurement is not clinically useful for patients with total serum PSA values less than 10.0 ng/mL or in the follow-up of patients with known prostate cancer.''More recently, a chemical precursor of PSA has been identified, [-2] proenzyme PSA. Preliminary studies show some promise that the level of this chemical, [-2] proenzyme PSA, may help differentiate between prostate cancer and benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) in men with a normal rectal examination and a PSA between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL.' "
What is PSA velocity and PSA doubling time?,"'Change in PSA levels over time can be used to assess both cancer risk and aggressiveness of the particular ''tumor''. Most urologists use these PSA metrics to help drive patient counseling and care. PSA velocity is defined as the rate (speed) of change in PSA over time. PSA doubling time is the time it takes the PSA value to increase by 100% (or double). Although these two measures do not appear to be useful in determining who is at risk for prostate cancer, they do appear to be useful in monitoring some individuals with prostate cancer.' "
How is PSA testing used for pretreatment staging of prostate cancer?,"'Once prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of cancer cells on prostate biopsy and assigned a cancer grade (''Gleason score''), PSA is used in combination with the grade of the prostate cancer to determine further medical studies needed for cancer staging. Staging (otherwise viewed as the extent of spread of the cancer within the body, or ""Where in the body are the cancer cells?"") determines if the cancer is localized (confined to the organ) or metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body). Staging therefore drives the best management and appropriate treatment for the cancer. As mentioned earlier, serum PSA levels correlate with the risk of prostate cancer extension outside of the prostate including seminal vesicle invasion as well as ''metastasis'' to the pelvic ''lymph nodes''.''The proportion of men with cancer confined to the prostate is about 80% when the PSA level at diagnosis is less than 4.0 ng/mL; about 70% when the PSA level is between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL; and about 50% when the PSA level is greater than 10.0 ng/mL. This is why patients with serum PSA levels of less than 10.0 ng/mL are most likely to respond well to local therapy such as ''prostatectomy'' (surgical removal of the prostate) or external beam ''radiation'' (''radiation therapy''). The need for additional medical tests such as a ''bone scan'' and ''CT scan'' to assess the extent of the prostate cancer will depend on the prostate biopsy results and PSA. Bone scans, used to determine if the prostate cancer has spread to the bones, are recommended if there is high grade prostate cancer present, extensive disease on the biopsy, and PSA > 10-20 ng/mL. CT scan is used to assess for pelvic ''lymph node'' enlargement suggestive of prostate cancer metastases to the lymph nodes and is recommended for individuals with high grade prostate cancer and PSA > 10 ng/mL. Over the past few decades, several predictive tools (otherwise called nomograms) have included the PSA in their parameters to predict posttreatment outcomes. These nomograms include the Partin and Kattan nomograms from Memorial Sloan Kettering. For instance, the Kattan nomogram is an online predictive tool that is available to the public (''https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate'').' "
How is PSA testing used in the management of prostate cancer after treatment?,"'A periodic PSA determination is used to detect disease recurrence after treatment. Serum PSA should decrease and remain at undetectable levels after a radical prostatectomy (complete removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles). An increase in the PSA over time after radical prostatectomy is suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, failure of the PSA to decrease to an undetectable level after radical prostatectomy may indicate residual prostate cancer. Similarly, serum PSA should fall to a low level (nadir) following radiation therapy, high intensity focused ''ultrasound'', and ''cryotherapy'' and remain at or near this level over time.' "
What are the limitations of the PSA test?,"'The level of PSA is a continuous parameter; the higher the value, the higher the probability of having prostate cancer. On the other hand, men may have prostate cancer despite low levels of PSA. In a U.S. ''prevention'' study, 6.6% of the men whose PSA level was less than 0.5 ng/mL had prostate cancer. Thus, although age and ethnicity-based normal reference ranges exist, they have limitations. Furthermore, PSA does not allow one to predict the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer (meaning cancer that is likely to be aggressive and require treatment) being present, thus subjecting men to potentially unnecessary biopsy and treatment and the morbidity associated with these.' "
What is digital rectal examination (DRE)?,"'Most prostate ''cancers'' are located in the peripheral zone of the prostate and may be detected by DRE. During this examination a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum to feel the prostate for lumps, size, shape, tenderness, and hardness. A suspect DRE is an absolute indication for prostate biopsy, regardless of the PSA level. In about 18% of patients with abnormal DRE, prostate cancer will be detected regardless of the PSA level.' "
What is the PSA screening controversy?,"'The goal of measuring PSA in men with no symptoms of cancer as a screening test for prostate cancer is to reduce the mortality caused by this cancer. Although the advent of prostate ''cancer screening'' is associated with decreased prostate cancer deaths, concerns exist regarding risks of overtreatment and the associated risks of such treatments.''A substantial number of the cancers detected by PSA screening are early stage and low-risk, and these patients will likely never die from this disease. PSA screening, due to its low specificity, does not allow differentiating between low-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. Hence PSA systematic screening is inevitably associated with over-diagnosis and potentially overtreatment. Therefore, not only do these patients not benefit from early detection but they also carry the burden of a cancer diagnosis. In addition, a subset of these patients may suffer the side effects of an unnecessary treatment.''One large European trial (ERSPC) found that PSA screening significantly reduces the mortality (death rate) of prostate cancer but is also associated with a high risk of over-diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2% in the PSA screening group and 4.8% in the control group. Patients in the screening group were 20% less likely to die from prostate cancer compared with the control group. The absolute risk difference between the two groups was 0.71 deaths per 1,000 men. This means that to prevent one death from prostate cancer, 1,410 men would need to be screened with PSA testing and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated.''Another trial (PLCO) conducted in the United States recently concluded that there is no evidence of an improvement in death rate from prostate cancer with annual PSA screening compared with usual medical care. After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control groups were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10,000 person-years, respectively, meaning that there was no significant difference between the two groups.''Based on the results of the PLCO trial, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) initially advised against PSA screening in their draft recommendation issued in 2011. More recently, the USPSTF issued a draft of revised recommendations that await finalization. This draft statement reports that the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individualized one. That USPSTF recommended individualized decision-making about ''screening for prostate cancer'' after discussion with the physician so that each man has the opportunity to understand the potential benefits and harms of screening and to incorporate his values and preferences into his decision.''Several urological associations, including the American Urological Association (AUA), Canadian Urological Association (CUA), and European Urological Association (EAU), still value the benefit of PSA screening and recommend physician-patient discussions about screening on an individual basis. The American Urological Association guidelines currently do not recommend routine prostate cancer screening in men between the ages of 40 and 54 years who are felt to be at average risk. For men less than 55 years of age at higher risk (for example, family history of prostate cancer, African-American race), decisions regarding prostate cancer screening should be individualized. The guidelines panel recommends shared decision-making for men 55-69 years of age who are considering prostate cancer screening. Furthermore, the panel notes that to reduce the harms of screening a routine screening interval of two years or more may be preferred over annual screening in those men who shared in clinical decision-making and decided on screening. Lastly, routine PSA screening was not recommended in men 70 years of age and older or any male with less than a 10- to 15-year life expectancy.''The American Cancer Society recommends that asymptomatic men (with no symptoms) who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at 50 years of age. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before 50 years of age.''The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer noted that most panel members favored informed prostate cancer screening, in men with 10 or more year life expectancy, beginning at age 45 years of age. The panel recommended testing at one- to two-year intervals for men with a PSA of > 1.0 ng/ml and every two to four years for those with PSA < 1 ng/mL.' "
How should the PSA test be used for the early detection of prostate cancer?,"'Ultimately, the decision to use PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer should be individualized. Men should be informed of the known risks and the potential benefits of early screening. Not all men are appropriate candidates for screening efforts. For instance, screening in men with less than a 10-year life expectancy, either due to age or other illness, is discouraged as there will be most likely no benefit for them.''If prostate cancer is detected on prostate biopsy, all treatment options should be discussed. The benefits and risks of the many treatment options should be reviewed and discussed with men found to have prostate cancer. The AUA recommends that this discussion include active surveillance in men with low-risk prostate cancer. The goal of active surveillance is to allow men to maintain their quality of life when the disease is slow-growing or inactive but still allow them to be cured of prostate cancer when the disease appears to become more aggressive or is fast-growing. Other novel biomarkers, such as PCA3 (see below), may assist the clinician in these decisions.' "
What is PCA3?,"'A newly discovered biomarker is known as PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3). PCA3 may help to discriminate between cancer-related versus nonspecific PSA elevations. PCA3 was initially identified by comparing prostate cancer tissue with nonmalignant normal prostatic tissue. PCA3 is a type of genetic material known as noncoding RNA that is found at high levels in prostate cancerous tissue. But unlike PSA, it is only present at a low level in benign prostatic tissue. Hence PCA3 can be considered a prostate cancer specific marker.''While PSA is detected in the blood, PCA3 is measured in the urine obtained after prostatic ''massage''. The main advantages of PCA3 over PSA testing are its higher sensitivity and specificity. In particular, PCA3 may be useful for identifying prostate cancer in men who initially had negative biopsies despite an elevated PSA. This is why the use of a PCA3 test may help reduce the number of potentially unnecessary biopsies generated by nonspecific positive PSA screening tests. PCA3 scores that are over 35 are considered higher risk and would then warrant investigation by a prostate biopsy. The 2013 AUA guidelines on early detection of prostate cancer recognize that PCA3 plays a role as a secondary screening test (after PSA screening) and can be used as an adjunct for informing decisions about the need for biopsy or repeat biopsy.' "
What is the 4K biomarker?,"'The ''4kscore test'' measures free and total PSA, human kallikrein 2 (hk2), and intact PSA and considers age, digital rectal exam results, and prior biopsy status. The test result reports the percent likelihood of finding high-grade prostate cancer on a prostate biopsy result. This test is not approved by the FDA, rather it is regulated as a laboratory-developed test. No cutoff threshold has been established for this test. Currently, the NCCN recommendations are that this test can be considered in patients prior to biopsy and for those with a prior negative prostate biopsy who are thought to be at higher risk for a high grade prostate cancer.' "
What is a PSA test?,"'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a substance produced only by certain cells within the male prostate gland. Biochemically, it belongs to the protease family of kallikrein and is also known as human kallikrein 3 (hK3). PSA is released by the prostate into the semen where it acts to liquefy the semen following ejaculation. Most of the PSA produced by the prostate gland is carried out of the body in semen, but a very small amount escapes into the bloodstream, so PSA is normally found in low amounts (nanograms per milliliter or ng/mL) in the blood. PSA has also been found in some breast tissue in women, although these amounts of PSA are very low.''If the PSA level is high for your age or is steadily increasing (with or without an abnormal physical exam), further investigation, namely a prostate biopsy, may be recommended. The health care provider should consider other health risk factors of prostate cancer such as family history, prostate volume, the presence of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), urinary symptoms, rectal exam findings, ethnicity, and medications that you are taking before recommending the biopsy. At this time, prostate biopsy for pathology review is the only way to determine if prostate cancer or other abnormal cells are present in the prostate.' "
How is the PSA count measured?,"'PSA is measured by a simple blood test that does not require fasting or special preparation. Since the amount of PSA in the blood is very low, detection of it requires a very sensitive type of technology (monoclonal antibody technique). The PSA protein can exist in the blood by itself (known as free PSA) or be bound with other substances (known as bound or complexed PSA). PSA is mostly bound to three substances: alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), and albumin. Total PSA is the sum of the free and the bound forms. The total PSA is what is measured with the standard PSA test. More recently, a precursor of PSA, proenzyme PSA ([-2] proenzyme PSA), has been identified, which may be helpful in determining prostate cancer risk in men with a PSA under 10 and a normal digital rectal examination. The prostate health index (PHI) is a new approved test that measures the total PSA, free PSA, and [-2] proenzyme PSA. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines include use of PHI as a secondary test option for men making decisions about an initial or repeat biopsy. The 4K score test is another test that incorporates PSA. The 4K score uses a prediction model based on clinical variables (age, prior biopsy, digital rectal examination results) and laboratory measurements of total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and a related protein known as hK2 (human kallikrein-related peptidase 2).' "
What causes elevated PSA levels?,"'It is believed that elevation of PSA in the blood is due to its release into the circulation (bloodstream) because of a breakdown (disruption) of the prostate cellular architecture (structure). However, the reasons are not fully known. A high PSA level can occur in the setting of different prostate diseases/conditions including prostate cancer but also as a result of noncancerous causes. It is important to note that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer but to prostatic tissue, and therefore PSA elevations may indicate the presence of any kind of prostate disease. Common benign causes of PSA elevation include ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' or BPH (an age-related, natural enlargement of the prostate, secondary to a noncancerous growth of prostate glandular cells), ''prostatitis'' (inflammation or infection of the prostate), and ''urinary tract infection''. In fact, PSA elevation can also occur with prostate manipulation such as ejaculation, prostate examination (digital rectal examination), medical instrumentation (cystoscopy), ''urinary retention'' or Foley catheter placement, and prostate biopsy. It is also thought that vigorous ''exercise'' that may affect the prostate, such as bicycle riding, can increase the PSA. It is for these reasons that patients should abstain from sex one to two days prior to PSA testing. Some physicians may recommend repeating a PSA test to ensure that the elevation is not related to these noncancerous causes.' "
What can lower the PSA test results?,"'Medications commonly taken to treat benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) such as ''finasteride'' (''Proscar''), ''dutasteride'' (''Avodart''), and a combination of dutasteride and ''tamsulosin'' (Jalyn) can decrease the PSA by about 50% within six to 12 months of starting their use. Another medication used to treat ''fungal infections'', ''ketoconazole'', can also lower PSA levels. Lastly, herbal ''supplements'' such as saw palmetto and those containing phytoestrogens, which are plant-derived chemicals with estrogen-like effects, can also lower the PSA level. It is important to tell your health care provider all the medications, both prescription and nonprescription, as well as any herbal preparations or health ''supplements'' that you are taking.' "
What is the accuracy of the PSA test?,"'One of the limitations of the PSA test is that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer and that it can be affected by several common conditions such as benign enlargement of the prostate, inflammation, and infection of the prostate. Furthermore, there is some variability in PSA results when using different testing equipment. One study showed that 25% (one in four) men who had an initial PSA result between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL had a normal test result when it was repeated.''Limitations of PSA testing include a high false-positive rate (a test that incorrectly indicates that a particular condition is present). In fact, only about 25% of men who have an elevated PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL will have prostate cancer identified on prostate biopsy and 75% will not. If one uses a lower cutoff of 3.1 ng/mL, PSA had a sensitivity (the proportion of men who test positive for the condition among those that have the condition) of 32% and specificity (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as negative) of 87% for identifying prostate cancer.''Another concern in addition to the low specificity in detecting the presence of prostate cancer is the inability of the test to discriminate between a more aggressive, high-risk, prostate cancer from one that is less likely to cause harm, or a low-risk prostate cancer. This is thought to lead to overtreatment in up to 50% of men with prostate cancer.' "
What are normal results for the PSA test?,"'The ""normal"" PSA serum concentration remains a debate, however, for most laboratory readings, it should be less than 4.0 ng/mL. The prostate gland generally increases in size and produces more PSA with increasing age, so it is normal to have lower levels in young men and higher levels in older men. Due to these normal changes in PSA with age, the concept of age-adjusted PSA normals have been described and recommended. What is considered to be a normal PSA level also depends on ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. Once an initial PSA has been obtained, the change in the PSA over time, the PSA velocity, plays a role in clinical decision making. It is felt that the PSA velocity over a year should be less than 0.75 ng/mL. For example, a man 50 to 59 years of age with a PSA level that is 0.5 ng/mL one year and increases to 2.5 ng/mL the following year, may be viewed as having a normal PSA level, but the rate of change in his PSA (PSA velocity) would be worrisome for an underlying prostate cancer. Lastly, as the size of the prostate gland may affect the PSA level, PSA density (PSA level divided by prostate volume) can also be a helpful number. A PSA density of 0.18 or less appears to be an optimal number.'  "
What are age-specific reference ranges for serum PSA?,"'The use of age-specific PSA ranges for the detection of prostate cancer is helpful to avoid unnecessary investigations in older men with larger prostate glands (typically walnut-sized). Median PSA value for men aged 40 to 49 years is 0.7 ng/mL and for men 50 to 59 years is 0.9 ng/mL. Not all studies have agreed that this is better than simply using a level of 4.0 ng/mL as the highest normal value. Nevertheless, due to the age-related growth of the prostate, the concept of adjusting the cutoff values based on age has helped reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in older men to improve early prostate cancer detection. Below are the suggested age-adjusted values based on age and race.' "
How is PSA used for early detection of prostate cancer?,"'Clinically localized prostate cancer (prostate cancer confirmed to the prostate gland) generally does not usually cause any symptoms. In general, most men with organ-confined (early, localized) ''prostate cancers'' have PSA values that are typically less than 20 ng/mL. Once PSA values are greater than 20 ng/mL, the risk for metastatic (distant spread) disease increases significantly. Men with early prostate cancer usually feel perfectly well and have no urinary symptoms related to the prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of prostate cancer cells in a prostate biopsy specimen, elevated PSA remains the most common indication for prostate biopsy. An abnormal prostate on digital rectal examination is also an indication for prostate biopsy, and thus ''prostate cancer screening'' should not be solely PSA-based.''It is the hope that the ability to identify changes like increases in PSA or abnormalities on rectal examination will allow for early detection of prostate cancer and allow for close monitoring (active surveillance) or definitive treatment to prevent the development of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-related deaths. However, given the sensitivity of PSA testing, the trade-off of evaluating those individuals with an elevated PSA is the possibility of an unnecessary prostate biopsy and associated risks (infection, ''blood in the urine''/ejaculate) and ''anxiety''. In addition, current ''prostate cancer screening'' is limited by its ability to identify individuals with high-risk prostate cancer, prior to prostate biopsy.''Limitations with PSA testing have led to a search for alternative biomarkers. More recently, other novel biomarkers and tests (PCA3, 4K, PHI, as well as prostate ''MRI'' imaging) have emerged as additional adjuncts to patient counseling. Unfortunately, none can confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Nor can these tests, including PSA, allow one to predict prior to biopsy if an individual has an aggressive form of prostate cancer.''Although not perfectly specific as a biomarker, the level of PSA has been demonstrated to be an independent variable to predict the presence of prostate cancer. In fact, the higher the level, the more likely prostate cancer is present. An abnormality in results will usually require additional testing. However, definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer depends on the presence of cancer cells obtained either from prostate biopsy or surgical specimens.''In general, PSA levels greater than 4 ng/mL are usually considered suspicious. As levels increase above 10.0 ng/mL, the probability of cancer increases dramatically. However, not all men with prostate cancer have elevated PSA levels. It is known that a small but significant number of people with prostate cancer can present with a PSA level of less than 4.0 ng/mL. This is why health care professionals may use lower thresholds to decide when to do a biopsy, depending on the presence of risk factors (for example, family history of prostate cancer, ethnicity) and other factors such as PSA density and PSA velocity.''For an average man over the age of 50 with a normal digital rectal exam, the average probability of having prostate cancer detectable by prostate biopsy according to his PSA level is as follows:''Since the likelihood of having prostate cancer increases proportionately with PSA level, there is no threshold below which a man can be reassured that prostate cancer is not present.''In order to improve the specificity of the PSA test in the early detection of prostate cancer, several modifications of the serum PSA value have been described including the ratio of free/total PSA and the measurement of PSA change over time.' "
What is the cost of the PSA test?,"""The PSA blood test is frequently covered by insurance, especially for men who are 50 years of age and older. PSA blood tests costs $20-$50. However, if it is obtained in the doctor's office during a visit to the doctor there may be an additional charge of $25-$100 for the office visit. There are PSA blood tests available for home use. The home blood test comes with a lancet to prick your finger and squeeze out a sample of blood, a kit to collect the blood, a bandage, and an address or prepaid mailer to return to the laboratory. Not all of the advertised home blood tests are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You can access the FDA web site to make sure you are using an approved test."" "
What is free/total PSA ratio?,"'Although prostate cancer cells do not produce more PSA than benign prostate tissue, the PSA produced from cancerous cells appears to escape an enzymatic processing that cleaves the bond between PSA and the protein that binds to it. Therefore, men with prostate cancer have a greater fraction of complexed, or bound, serum PSA and a lower amount of unbound (free) PSA compared with men without prostate cancer. Therefore, the free/total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) can be additionally used in clinical practice to discriminate between PSA elevation secondary to benign prostatic disease and ''prostate cancers''. This is particularly useful for patients with a total PSA level between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a negative normal rectal exam to help the health care provider to decide if a biopsy is necessary. In one study, prostate cancer was found in 56% of men with a free/total PSA less than 0.10 (10%) but in only 8% of men with free/total PSA greater than 0.25 (25%). Nevertheless, the concept of free PSA must be used with caution as several factors may influence the free/total PSA ratio such as temperature and prostate size. Furthermore, the free PSA measurement is not clinically useful for patients with total serum PSA values less than 10.0 ng/mL or in the follow-up of patients with known prostate cancer.''More recently, a chemical precursor of PSA has been identified, [-2] proenzyme PSA. Preliminary studies show some promise that the level of this chemical, [-2] proenzyme PSA, may help differentiate between prostate cancer and benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) in men with a normal rectal examination and a PSA between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL.' "
What is PSA velocity and PSA doubling time?,"'Change in PSA levels over time can be used to assess both cancer risk and aggressiveness of the particular ''tumor''. Most urologists use these PSA metrics to help drive patient counseling and care. PSA velocity is defined as the rate (speed) of change in PSA over time. PSA doubling time is the time it takes the PSA value to increase by 100% (or double). Although these two measures do not appear to be useful in determining who is at risk for prostate cancer, they do appear to be useful in monitoring some individuals with prostate cancer.' "
How is PSA testing used for pretreatment staging of prostate cancer?,"'Once prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of cancer cells on prostate biopsy and assigned a cancer grade (''Gleason score''), PSA is used in combination with the grade of the prostate cancer to determine further medical studies needed for cancer staging. Staging (otherwise viewed as the extent of spread of the cancer within the body, or ""Where in the body are the cancer cells?"") determines if the cancer is localized (confined to the organ) or metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body). Staging therefore drives the best management and appropriate treatment for the cancer. As mentioned earlier, serum PSA levels correlate with the risk of prostate cancer extension outside of the prostate including seminal vesicle invasion as well as ''metastasis'' to the pelvic ''lymph nodes''.''The proportion of men with cancer confined to the prostate is about 80% when the PSA level at diagnosis is less than 4.0 ng/mL; about 70% when the PSA level is between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL; and about 50% when the PSA level is greater than 10.0 ng/mL. This is why patients with serum PSA levels of less than 10.0 ng/mL are most likely to respond well to local therapy such as ''prostatectomy'' (surgical removal of the prostate) or external beam ''radiation'' (''radiation therapy''). The need for additional medical tests such as a ''bone scan'' and ''CT scan'' to assess the extent of the prostate cancer will depend on the prostate biopsy results and PSA. Bone scans, used to determine if the prostate cancer has spread to the bones, are recommended if there is high grade prostate cancer present, extensive disease on the biopsy, and PSA > 10-20 ng/mL. CT scan is used to assess for pelvic ''lymph node'' enlargement suggestive of prostate cancer metastases to the lymph nodes and is recommended for individuals with high grade prostate cancer and PSA > 10 ng/mL. Over the past few decades, several predictive tools (otherwise called nomograms) have included the PSA in their parameters to predict posttreatment outcomes. These nomograms include the Partin and Kattan nomograms from Memorial Sloan Kettering. For instance, the Kattan nomogram is an online predictive tool that is available to the public (''https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate'').' "

Serum PSA should decrease and remain at undetectable levels after a radical prostatectomy (complete removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles). An increase in the PSA over time after radical prostatectomy is suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, failure of the PSA to decrease to an undetectable level after radical prostatectomy may indicate residual prostate cancer. Similarly, serum PSA should fall to a low level (nadir) following radiation therapy, high intensity focused ''ultrasound'', and ''cryotherapy'' and remain at or near this level over time.' "

The 2013 AUA guidelines on early detection of prostate cancer recognize that PCA3 plays a role as a secondary screening test (after PSA screening) and can be used as an adjunct for informing decisions about the need for biopsy or repeat biopsy.' "
What is the 4K biomarker?,"'The ''4kscore test'' measures free and total PSA, human kallikrein 2 (hk2), and intact PSA and considers age, digital rectal exam results, and prior biopsy status. The test result reports the percent likelihood of finding high-grade prostate cancer on a prostate biopsy result. This test is not approved by the FDA, rather it is regulated as a laboratory-developed test. No cutoff threshold has been established for this test. Currently, the NCCN recommendations are that this test can be considered in patients prior to biopsy and for those with a prior negative prostate biopsy who are thought to be at higher risk for a high grade prostate cancer.' "
What is the prostate gland? What does it look like?,"'The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system, and it is a walnut-sized gland found in men that is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine and semen exit the body. Its main function is to produce seminal fluid in order to transport sperm through the urethra.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of prostatitis?,"'The symptoms associated with prostatitis can vary depending on the underlying cause of prostatitis. The symptoms may appear slowly or come on quickly, and they may improve rapidly (depending on the cause and treatment available) or they may last for several months and they can keep recurring (chronic prostatitis). The rapidity and severity of onset is usually most pronounced with acute bacterial prostatitis. The following are signs and symptoms that may be present with prostatitis:'

   Painful, difficult and/or frequent urinating Blood in the urine Groin pain, rectal pain, abdominal pain and/or low back pain Fever and chills Malaise and body aches Urethral discharge Painful ejaculation or sexual dysfunction"
When should you call your doctor if you think you may have prostatitis symptoms?,"'If you have any of the signs or symptoms consistent with prostatitis, you should see your health care professional for further evaluation. Depending on the symptoms and your response to therapy, your doctor may need to refer you to a ''urologist'' (a physician specializing in the genitourinary system).' "
What causes prostatitis?,"'Prostatitis can be caused by bacteria that leak into the prostate gland from the urinary tract (the most common bacterial cause) and from direct extension or lymphatic spread from the rectum. It can also result from various sexually transmitted organisms such as ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', or ''HIV''. Other organisms responsible for infection are the same found most frequently in ''urinary tract infections'', such as ''Escherichia coli''. In many instances (especially in the chronic form of prostatitis), no specific cause of prostatitis can be found.' "
What are the risk factors for prostatitis?,"'Men of all ages can be affected by prostatitis, but it is more common in young and middle-aged men. Other risk factors for the development of prostatitis include the following:' A prior history of prostatitis Having a recent urinary tract infection Recent use of a urinary catheter or a recent urologic procedure Enlarged prostate gland Engaging in rectal intercourse Having a structural or functional urinary tract abnormality Dehydration (not enough fluids) Local pelvic trauma or injury such as from bicycle riding or horseback riding"
What tests diagnose prostatitis? What are prostate-specific antigens?,"'Prostatitis is usually diagnosed by analyzing a urine sample and undergoing an examination of your prostate gland by your health care practitioner. This examination involves a digital rectal examination to palpate the prostate gland and feel for abnormalities of the gland. Occasionally, the physician may also collect and test a sample of the prostatic fluid.''Sometimes a prostate ''massage'' is performed to compare samples of the prostatic fluid both before and after this intervention has been performed. To perform this procedure, the doctor will ''stroke''/massage the prostate gland during the digital rectal examination. Because there is the concern that this procedure can release bacteria into the bloodstream, this test is contraindicated in cases of acute bacterial prostatitis.''Additional tests that may be obtained include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), an ''electrolyte'' panel, blood cultures, a swab of urethral discharge if present, and sometimes a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. The ''PSA test'', which is used as a screening test for ''prostate cancer'', may also be elevated with prostatitis.''Other tests that may also be obtained include urodynamic tests (to check how well you empty your bladder and establish if prostatitis is affecting your ability to urinate), ''ultrasound'' imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, ''cystoscopy'', and a prostate biopsy.''If recurring episodes of ''urinary tract infections'' and prostatitis occur, see your doctor for a more detailed evaluation of your genitourinary system for anatomic abnormalities, which may make you more prone to infections.' "
What is the best treatment for prostatitis?,"'Treatment for prostatitis depends on the underlying cause and type of prostatitis. Antibiotics are prescribed if the cause is a bacterial infection. All forms of prostatitis require ''pain'' control if needed, treatment, relief of complications and side effects, and need to be closely monitored by your doctor. In certain instances, some people with prostatitis may need to be hospitalized for treatment.'

   Antibiotics: Your doctor will decide the specific antibiotic and the duration of treatment. Anti-inflammatory medications: These can help manage your pain. Alpha-blockers: By relaxing the muscle fibers around the bladder and prostate gland, alpha-blockers may decrease your urinary symptoms and help you empty your bladder."
"What natural or home remedies relieve pain, symptoms, and treat prostatitis?","'In addition to medical treatment, natural home remedies for prostatitis include:' Warm sitz baths Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods. Prostate massage: In a few studies, prostate massage has been shown to decrease symptoms in some patients with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. Lifestyle changes: If you cycle or ride horses, it is recommended to suspend this activity until you improve. Although there are many herbal preparations available, there is no current evidence that herbal remedies are definitely helpful with prostatitis. Acupuncture has shown a decrease in symptoms for some people who suffer from prostatitis."
What are the complications of prostatitis?,"'There are several potential complications of prostatitis, which may include the following:''Prostatitis can elevate the PSA level. There is no evidence that prostatitis leads to prostate ''cancer''. If the acute inflammation/episode of prostatitis has resolved, the PSA level will usually return to baseline levels.'   acute prostatitis becoming chronic prostatitis, bladder outlet obstruction or urinary retention, infertility, abscess of the prostate gland, spreading of the infection to the blood stream (bacteremia/sepsis), and rarely death."
What is the prognosis for prostatitis? Does it increase the risk of developing prostate cancer?,"'Prostatitis caused by bacterial illness often can be treated with antibiotics, or the condition can be chronic that recurs and requires long-term medical attention.' Acute bacterial prostatitis can often be treated very successfully and has a very good prognosis. Chronic prostatitis, and especially chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, can often lead to long-term symptoms and discomfort if treatment is unsuccessful. It is important to have close follow-up and continued care by either your primary care doctor or a urologist. Prostatitis does not increase your risk of developing prostate cancer."
Prostatitis vs. BPH quick comparison of differences and similarities," Both BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and prostatitis are problems with the prostate gland, a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder in males. The prostate gland is responsible for releasing prostatic fluid that helps make up part of the semen. The normal prostate gland is about the size of a walnut. As it increases in size, for whatever reason, it can press on the urethra and cause urinary problems. Both prostatitis and BPH can result in an enlarged prostate. Most men over 50 years old have some prostate enlargement with no symptoms, while bacterial prostatitis usually occurs in men younger than 35 years old and non-infectious prostatitis occurs in older men. You can have either BPH or prostatitis, and have no signs or symptoms. Nevertheless, both can cause pain (dysuria or pain with urination). Prostatitis is caused by infections (usually bacterial) or other related health problems, while doctors don’t know exactly what causes an enlarged prostate, but they think it may be related to hormones. BPH can be treated but not cured, but prostatitis is curable in many patients. The large majority of men with prostatitis have an infection of the prostate gland, while those with BPH do not have an infection."
What is prostatitis?,'The definition of prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate tissue. Causes of the inflammation can be from infection or other health problems.' 
What is BPH (enlarged prostate)?,"'Most men over the age of 50 have some prostate enlargement due to the proliferation of the cells that comprise the prostate gland. Most of these men have BPH, or ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'', even though do not have any symptoms. This gland enlargement is noncancerous and is termed ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'' or BPH. There is only one type of BPH, “benign,” meaning non-cancerous or not ''malignant'' in medical terms.' "
Are prostatitis and BPH the same prostate gland problem?,"'The answer to this question is yes and no, because both may have some similar health symptoms (problems), but each prostate problem have different causes. Yes, BPH is by definition an ''enlarged prostate'', and no, because the cause is not an infection/inflammation like prostatitis. However, not all enlarged prostates are due to BPH. An enlarged prostate may be caused by BPH, prostatitis, and ''prostate cancer''.' "
Do prostatitis and BPH cause pain?,"'Both BPH and prostatitis may cause pain. However, if BPH causes pain, it usually occurs with urination (dysuria).''Prostatitis may cause ''painful urination'', painful ejaculations, and generalized groin/''abdominal pain''. Prostatitis pain may be more constant and may be due to the inflammation of the prostatic tissue and/or adjacent tissues. Experts point out that often the source of pain from prostatitis is unclear.' "
How can I tell the difference between prostatitis and BPH (signs and symptoms)?,"'If you do not have any symptoms of BPH or any of the types of prostatitis, which can be the situation for some men, you may not be able to tell if you have either problem. However, a doctor or other health care professional can detect enlargement of the prostate with a digital rectal exam (digital examination of the rectal area and prostate), even if you don’t have any symptoms.''If you do have symptoms, they are related to the increase in size of your prostate gland. When the gland enlarges, it can constrict the urethra and produce one or more of these symptoms.''The ''symptoms of prostatitis'' depend upon the type of prostatitis.''Some men may have some of these symptoms with both BPH and prostatitis. If you are over age 50, it is more likely BPH than prostatitis, and if you are under age 35, acute bacterial prostatitis is more likely than BPH. In some patients, prostatitis may be recurrent (you may get the condition again).'   The need to urinate frequently during the day or night The sudden urgent need to urinate Difficulty initiating urinary stream Feeling like you still need to urinate even though you recently urinated Feeling like you need to push or strain to empty your bladder A decrease in the force of the urine stream Loss of small amounts of urine (dribbling urine) Fever Chills Muscle soreness Joint discomfort Feeling tired Prostatic discomfort and/or pain Painful urination (dysuria) Low back pain and/or abdominal pain Possible urethral discharge Urinary stream problems such as frequency, urgency, weak urine stream Intermittent painful urination Intermittent obstructive urinary tract symptoms Recurrent urinary tract infections (with some symptoms for type I) Pelvic pain and/or discomfort Obstructive urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, painful urination, and incomplete urination Pain with ejaculation Erectile dysfunction (ED) By definition, type IV has no symptoms, but sometimes is diagnosed from a prostate biopsy or suspected when a prostate-specific antigen test (PSA blood test) is elevated."
What causes prostatitis vs. BPH?,"'The cause of BPH or enlarged prostate is by benign growth that enlarges the prostate gland. Researchers do not know exactly what causes the gland to enlarge, but they have speculated that it might be related to hormonal changes as men age.''In men under the age of 35, the most common type of prostatitis is acute bacterial prostatitis, while in older patients non-bacterial prostatitis is the most common type. There are four types or syndromes of prostatitis.''The cause of acute bacterial prostatitis is by bacteria that may be present in the urethra and then infect the prostate gland. Chronic bacterial prostatitis (about 75% of infections are due to ''E. coli'') occurs because of inadequate treatment or because of a structural/functional problem in the urinary tract. Researchers and doctors do not completely understand the cause of chronic prostatitis, but it is speculated that the cause may be initiated by neurological injury and/or related to infection.' Type I - Acute bacterial prostatitis Type II - Chronic bacterial prostatitis Type III Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome Type IV is asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis."
"Where is the prostate gland located, and what does it look like?", 
What should I do if I think I may have prostate problems?,"'Regardless of which problem you may think you have, you should see your primary care doctor. To make the diagnosis your doctor will take a complete history, physical exam that includes a digital rectal exam, and other appropriate diagnostic tests, for example, a ''urinalysis'', urine culture, blood tests such as the ''PSA test'', ''electrolytes'', ''creatinine'', and occasionally blood urea nitrogen levels. Your doctor may order other tests, for example, an ''ultrasound'', ''endoscopy'', urine flow rate studies, and biopsy of the prostate gland. Your doctor also may refer you to a specialist called a urologist, especially if you require surgery as part of your treatment.' "
Are the treatments for prostatitis and BPH different?,"'The treatment for an enlarged prostate and prostatitis are very different.''BPH treatment may include an interactive questionnaire to determine the extent of your symptoms. The results of the questionnaire may influence what medications or other treatments you may need. ''Drugs'' used to treat BPH include:''Some patients with more severe prostatic enlargement may need surgery. A transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the usual procedure to reduce pressure on the urethra by reducing the size of the prostate.''Treatment for prostatitis depends on the type.'  Alpha receptor blockers (alpha-1, alpha- adrenergic, 5-alpha reductase) Phosphodiesterase inhibitors Anticholinergic agents Bacteria acute and chronic prostatitis (type I and type II) are typically treated and cured with antibiotics like fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim. These infections typically take longer to cure so you may have to take antibiotics for as long as 4-8 weeks. Some infections of the prostate gland are resistant or unresponsive to treatment so antibiotics like gentamicin or doxycycline may need to be injected directly into the gland. Type III, chronic bacterial prostatitis and pelvic pain syndrome, is treated similarly with antibiotics, however, alpha-blockers and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), for example, aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Aleve, Advil), naproxen (Naproxen) also are used. Type IV, asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, in most patients requires no treatment. However, some doctors prescribe antibiotics and NSAIDs for this condition."
Can prostatitis and BPH be cured (prognosis)?,"'The prognosis for BPH for most patients that undergo treatment is good to fair, depending upon how well patients respond. BPH that requires surgery may result in complications such as ''erectile dysfunction''. The prognosis for patients with more severe BPH symptoms that require surgery and medication for symptom relief is fair. There is no cure for BPH.''Most men with prostatitis (all types) may have significant symptom relief, and most men can be cured with long-term appropriate antibiotic treatments. The prognosis for prostatitis ranges from good to fair because some patients have a tendency to have recurrent bouts of the condition.' "

Other habits involve playing sports and doing other activities that you probably think have nothing to do with your teeth."
Grinding teeth,"'What is ''teeth grinding''? Officially known as ''bruxism'', teeth grinding affects an estimated 8% of adults and the behavior can start as early as when they are infants. People who suffer from the condition often grind their teeth at night and in their ''sleep''. The symptoms of teeth grinding may include ''jaw pain'', ear pain, ''headaches'', and worn down teeth. The causes of teeth grinding are not entirely known, but factors like ''stress'', ''anxiety'', ''snoring'', and use of ''caffeine'', alcohol, and ''nicotine'' may play a role. Because the behavior can be so uncomfortable, many people want to know how to stop grinding their teeth at night.'""While there is no cure bruxism, using a mouth guard for teeth grinding is effective in *adults. A dentist may also prescribe a mouth splint to help protect the teeth and oral structures against grinding. Because children's are still growing and developing, a mouth guard is not recommended until growth has been completed. Although there is no solid scientific evidence that the following natural remedies are effective against teeth grinding, they may offer some benefit and are not harmful:""  Eat a crunchy snack before bed. Chewing relaxes the jaw muscles so you may be less likely to clench them at night. Place a warm compress on your jaw to promote muscle relaxation. Practice yoga or meditation regularly to combat stress, which may be associated with teeth grinding."
Chewing on ice,"""Chewing on ice is bad for your teeth because you could crack or chip them. Small cracks in your teeth can get bigger over time, eventually leading to a tooth fracture. Can't resist the urge to nibble on ice cubes? Sip water and ""'beverages'' that have been chilled in the fridge. ''Interestingly, the medical term for chewing on ice compulsively is pagophagia. Ice chewing is a form of pica, which refers to the eating of substances – including ice – that have no nutritional value. Ice chewing may occur in those who suffer from ''anemia'' or ''iron deficiency''. Populations especially at risk for ice chewing include:'  young people, menstruating women, and those who donate blood."
Playing sports without a mouth guard,"'All sports carry the risk of injury and ''dental injuries'' are certainly no exception. This is particularly true for high contact and impact sports such as hockey, basketball, soccer and football. A sports mouth guard helps to reduce the risk of common dental injuries such as fractured teeth, knocked out teeth, and temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'"") dislocation. A mouth guard helps to cushion your teeth and jaws from heavy impact and is an essential part of an athlete's protective gear. The mouth guard can be custom-made to fit properly so that it won't affect your ability to breathe or speak while at play.""'Your mouth guard can do double duty when used for teeth grinding. Grinding your teeth can cause jaw ''pain'', ''headaches'', and even fractured teeth! Using a mouth guard for teeth grinding will help reduce the stress on your jaw and teeth at night.' "
Tongue piercings,"'Different types of tongue or mouth piercings may be popular, but they can damage your teeth and mouth. Bacteria thrive in warm, moist areas. Unfortunately, the mouth is the ideal environment for a ''wound'', such as a piercing, to become infected. Pain and swelling are just a few of the potential complications you may experience after getting different kinds of oral piercings. Tongue piercings may chip or*damage teeth and gums if they come in contact with these structures. Be mindful of mouth jewelry and avoid contact that could damage your teeth and hurt your mouth.''Oral piercings require meticulous aftercare. Keep the site clean and report any symptoms of infection (''fever'', pain, swelling, ''chills'"") to your doctor or dentist immediately. Use mouth rinses frequently to hinder the growth of bacteria and avoid infection. Check jewelry periodically to make sure it is secure. You don't want to accidentally swallow it! Remove your piercing and use a mouth guard before playing sports, especially contact sports."" "
Bedtime bottles,"'Even though baby teeth are temporary, they are  essential for proper ''nutrition'' and preparing the way for the future permanent teeth in the mouth. Baby teeth are also still susceptible to decay. Giving your baby a bottle at night at bedtime increases the risk of dental decay. The decay can be so extreme that it has been given the name “''Baby Bottle Tooth Decay''.” Milk contains ''sugar'' that feeds bacteria in the mouth. The bacteria produce acids that damage teeth leading to dental decay. Allowing your baby to continuously ''sleep'"" at night with a milk bottle allows the mouth bacteria many uninterrupted hours to damage your little one's teeth. Give your baby a bottle of milk well before the baby goes to bed and afterwards, plan on cleaning the teeth and mouth with gauze or a ""'toothbrush''.'""Start good habits early in life to protect your baby's ""'oral health'"". Establish a bedtime routine that doesn't involve a bottle of milk. A warm bath and soothing music may be all your baby needs to promote sleep. If your baby still wants a bottle, filling it with water instead may still provide some comfort.""""Start good habits early in life to protect your baby's oral health.

Cough drops,"'Cough'' drops are meant to help calm your ''cough'' and soothe your throat, but they may do so at the expense of your teeth if they have ''sugar''. Because they are slow to dissolve in your mouth, cough drops bathe your teeth in sugar, which feeds bacteria. This sets you up for enamel erosion and possible ''tooth decay''. If you need a cough drop, opt for different kinds that are sugar free.'""The health of your teeth isn't the only thing to consider when choosing a cough drop. Although cough drops are generally considered safe while ""'pregnant'' or ''breastfeeding'', check with your health care professional before taking any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication. Having some tea with a bit of honey is another time-honored way to soothe your cough.' "
Gummy candy,"'Do you love ''chocolate'', lollipops, gum, and chewy candy? Frankly, none of them is great for your teeth, but sticky, chewy types are especially the worst offenders. Gummy candy, jelly beans, and caramel stick to your teeth and stay there in the crevices until they dissolve. This provides an ongoing sugar feast for bacteria in your mouth that produce acids that eat away at your tooth enamel.''If you must have candy, opt for sugar-free options. Better yet, choose healthy foods to snack on instead. Fruit can provide you with a bit of sugar to satisfy your sweet tooth while giving you a dose of nutrients that are actually good for you. Fruit supplies you with:' vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber that your body needs."
Drinking too much soda,"""Soda may be public enemy number one for your health and your teeth. It's a source of high sugar and liquid calories that are bad for your smile as well as your waistline. Sugary soda increases the risk of tooth decay and soda is also high in phosphoric and citric acids, which can eat through tooth enamel. It's best to skip soda all together. If you must indulge, sip it through a straw to minimize contact with your teeth. Rinse your mouth out with water immediately after drinking soda to wash away sugar and acid. However, wait 30 minutes after drinking soda before brushing your teeth. After drinking soda, the enamel on your teeth is softer and more easily damaged so you don't want to do further damage by brushing right after.""'What are other potential side effects of drinking soda? Soda drinking increases the risks of both ''diabetes'' and ''obesity'"". Think you're off the hook by choosing ""'diet'' sodas? Not so fast. ''Diet'' sodas have health risks, too. Daily consumption of diet soda has been associated both ''metabolic syndrome'' and type 2 diabetes. ''Metabolic syndrome'' is a set of risk factors that include ''high blood pressure'', ''abdominal fat'', high levels of ''cholesterol'', and ''high blood sugar''.' "
Opening stuff with your teeth,"""We've all done it, but using your teeth to open a bag of chips or wrench the cap off of a bottle is a really bad idea. Using your teeth to open things can lead to ""'tooth damage'"" like chips, fractures, and other kinds of damage. If you're lucky, a damaged tooth may be repaired with just a filling. If the damage is severe or very deep, you may need a ""'root canal'' and a ''crown'' to preserve the look and function of your tooth.'""Remember this cautionary tale the next time you're tempted to use your teeth to rip open a bag of chips. Reach for a pair of scissors, bottle opener, or other implement instead to open that package or bottle. Save your teeth from unnecessary potential damage."" "
Sports drinks,"'Sipping a sports drink after being active may seem like a good thing to do, but think again. Just like soda, sports ''drinks'' contain sugar and acid that can damage your teeth. These drinks damage your teeth for up to 20 minutes after you drink them. Admittedly, sports drinks have less sugar than soda, but because they are less sweet, you may be inclined to drink more of it. This increased sugar intake can also raise your risk of ''diabetes'' and obesity.'""To preserve and protect your teeth, choose plain water instead of acidic, sugary sports drinks to rehydrate. If you do drink a sports drink, rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterward. Then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. The acids in sports drinks soften tooth enamel, so if you brush immediately after sipping the drink, you risk further damage to your teeth. Sports drinks are no better for your teeth and waistline than soda. Remember that and don't buy into the marketing hype that tries to tell you otherwise."" "
Fruit juice,"'One survey found that adults grossly underestimate the amount of sugar in fruit drinks, sometimes by as much as 50%. The sugar content of some fruit juices is equivalent to that found in soda. In terms of ''dental health'"", fruit juice's high sugar content increases the risk of tooth decay. Citrus juices such as orange juice and lemonade are very acidic and contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel. Additionally, the same survey found that liquid calories comprised about 25% of the daily calories consumed by those participating in the study.""""The sugar, acid, and calories in fruit juice aren't good for your teeth and body. You can get your fruit fix in much healthier ways:"" You can enjoy the taste of juice without the wallop to your teeth and waistline by adding just a splash of juice to a glass of mineral water. Drink plain water with a squeeze of lemon or lime. Enjoy whole fruits that are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are good for you."
Potato chips,'High-starch foods stick to teeth and remain longer in the mouth than non-starchy foods. Potato chips are a perfect example. They remain on your teeth long after eating them and the results are similar to constant snacking. The starches serve as food for bacteria in your mouth. Bacteria produce acid and the acid wears down your enamel and sets the stage for tooth decay.''Use these tips to protect your teeth after eating potato chips:' Eat a crunchy apple or carrot to help remove starches stuck to your teeth. Brush or floss after you eat to remove food particles and minimize plaque formation.
Constant snacking,"""Constant snacking during the day means your teeth are exposed to more sugar. Bacteria in the mouth feed on that sugar producing acids that can erode tooth enamel. Frequent snacking contributes not only to tooth decay, but also to an increased risk of obesity. Follow these snacking do's and dont's:"" If you're hungry between meals, resist the urge to reach for sticky, starchy snacks like potato chips and pretzels. Forego liquid calories, too. Drinking more soda or alcohol bathes your teeth in sugar for bacteria to feed on. The best smile-friendly drink to reach for if you're thirsty is water. Curb your hunger by munching on cleansing-type snacks like carrots, apples, and celery. They will help remove food particles from your teeth."
Chewing on pencils,"'Chewing on pencils or other objects is a bad habit many people have. People may chew on pencils, erasers, bottle caps, and other things. The behavior is bad for teeth because it puts unnecessary stress on your teeth and could lead to a tooth chip or fracture. Chewing on foreign objects may also introduce potentially-dangerous bacteria into the mouth. This habit may also injure the gums and other soft tissues in the mouth, causing them to become swollen.''If you have the urge to chew, choose sugarless gum containing xylitol that promotes saliva flow and is actually good for your teeth.' "
Drinking coffee,"'Coffee may be the fuel you use to start your day, but ''caffeine'' in your morning brew can contribute to ''dry mouth'' and tooth decay. Caffeine stains teeth and inhibits saliva flow. Saliva neutralizes acids in the mouth and helps clear food particles from teeth. Combat ''dry mouth'' from caffeine by drinking more water throughout the day. And if you add sugar to coffee, your teeth may suffer for it. If you indulge in multiple coffee refills throughout the day, your risk of ''cavities'' increases even more.''If you must have coffee, follow these tips.' Choose decaf varieties to skip caffeine that can lead to dry mouth. If you must have sweetener, choose a sugar free kind that won't harm your teeth. Chew sugarless gum containing xylitol which is proven to reduce the risk of dental carries and stimulate saliva flow."
Smoking,"'Tobacco'' is bad for your teeth, oral tissues, and body. Here are just a few ways that ''smoking''*tobacco use are bad for you:''Several strategies are available to help you stop smoking. Speak to your doctor about patches, medications, and other treatments that can help you kick the habit.' It causes dry mouth which allows plaque to build up. Smoking is a risk factor for gum disease which is the leading cause of tooth loss among adults. Tobacco use stains teeth and increases the risk of tooth decay. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to lose teeth. Smoking and tobacco use are associated with increased rates of oral and lung cancers."
Drinking red wine,"'Several substances in red wine contribute to staining. Tooth enamel is not totally smooth. It contains small cracks that are susceptible to stains. Chromogens, acids, and tannins are three components of red wine that seep into cracks in tooth enamel, causing stains. Chromogens give red wine its deep, rich, red color. Acids erode tooth enamel. Tannins promote dryness that allows red pigments to bind to and discolor teeth.''You can do things to keep red wine stains from forming on your teeth. Eat a protein-rich snack, like cheese, when you drink wine. Rinse your mouth out with water after you imbibe. CChewing gum afterwards can help, too. These activities promote saliva flow that can help neutralize acids in the mouth.''Daily wine consumption may provide health benefits for some people. In one study, people who had well-controlled ''type 2 diabetes'' who drank red wine every night experienced moderate benefits in their cholesterol numbers. However, not everyone should drink wine before bed. Women should not drink red wine or other alcoholic beverages while pregnant. The risks and benefits of alcohol consumption differ slightly for men and for women. Speak with your healthcare professional if you want to know if wine consumption is a healthy practice for you.' "
Drinking white wine,"""Red wine is not the only kind that can do damage to teeth. One study suggests that white wine has the potential to cause more severe enamel erosion than red wine. White wine strips more calcium from teeth than red wine. White wines contain the same damaging tannins and acids that red wines do. The food you eat after drinking white wine affects staining, too. Skip the beet salad immediately after you've had wine. Wine primes your teeth to pick up whatever pigments are in the foods you're about to eat. The same rules apply for drinking white wine as compared to red. Women should not consume wine and other types of alcohol while pregnant."" "
Binge eating,"'Binge eating disorder'' is a condition in which the sufferer consumes vast amounts of food and feels unable to stop eating.  A person with the disorder often chooses high-calorie foods and drinks to binge on, often at night. The behavior is damaging to health, and the excess sugar is harmful to teeth. ''Bulimia'' is a similar disorder involving bingeing but the sufferer also vomits to purge what he or she has eaten. Stomach contents are highly acidic and very damaging to teeth. Symptoms and signs of ''eating disorders'' may include ''depression'', ''weight gain'', and feelings of shame and being out of control. The causes of binge eating disorders and other eating disorders are complex.''People who have an eating disorder can seek help to control their behavior in order to safeguard their health and teeth.

People who suffer from the condition often grind their teeth at night and in their ''sleep''. The symptoms of teeth grinding may include ''jaw pain'', ear pain, ''headaches'', and worn down teeth. The causes of teeth grinding are not entirely known, but factors like ''stress'', ''anxiety'', ''snoring'', and use of ''caffeine'', alcohol, and ''nicotine'' may play a role. Because the behavior can be so uncomfortable, many people want to know how to stop grinding their teeth at night.'""While there is no cure bruxism, using a mouth guard for teeth grinding is effective in *adults. A dentist may also prescribe a mouth splint to help protect the teeth and oral structures against grinding. Because children's are still growing and developing, a mouth guard is not recommended until growth has been completed. Although there is no solid scientific evidence that the following natural remedies are effective against teeth grinding, they may offer some benefit and are not harmful:""  Eat a crunchy snack before bed. Chewing relaxes the jaw muscles so you may be less likely to clench them at night. Place a warm compress on your jaw to promote muscle relaxation. Practice yoga or meditation regularly to combat stress, which may be associated with teeth grinding."
Chewing on ice,"""Chewing on ice is bad for your teeth because you could crack or chip them. Small cracks in your teeth can get bigger over time, eventually leading to a tooth fracture. Can't resist the urge to nibble on ice cubes? Sip water and ""'beverages'' that have been chilled in the fridge. ''Interestingly, the medical term for chewing on ice compulsively is pagophagia. Ice chewing is a form of pica, which refers to the eating of substances – including ice – that have no nutritional value. Ice chewing may occur in those who suffer from ''anemia'' or ''iron deficiency''. Populations especially at risk for ice chewing include:'  young people, menstruating women, and those who donate blood."
Playing sports without a mouth guard,"'All sports carry the risk of injury and ''dental injuries'' are certainly no exception. This is particularly true for high contact and impact sports such as hockey, basketball, soccer and football. A sports mouth guard helps to reduce the risk of common dental injuries such as fractured teeth, knocked out teeth, and temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'"") dislocation. A mouth guard helps to cushion your teeth and jaws from heavy impact and is an essential part of an athlete's protective gear. The mouth guard can be custom-made to fit properly so that it won't affect your ability to breathe or speak while at play.""'Your mouth guard can do double duty when used for teeth grinding. Grinding your teeth can cause jaw ''pain'', ''headaches'', and even fractured teeth! Using a mouth guard for teeth grinding will help reduce the stress on your jaw and teeth at night.' "
Tongue piercings,"'Different types of tongue or mouth piercings may be popular, but they can damage your teeth and mouth. Bacteria thrive in warm, moist areas. Unfortunately, the mouth is the ideal environment for a ''wound'', such as a piercing, to become infected. Pain and swelling are just a few of the potential complications you may experience after getting different kinds of oral piercings. Tongue piercings may chip or*damage teeth and gums if they come in contact with these structures. Be mindful of mouth jewelry and avoid contact that could damage your teeth and hurt your mouth.''Oral piercings require meticulous aftercare. Keep the site clean and report any symptoms of infection (''fever'', pain, swelling, ''chills'"") to your doctor or dentist immediately. Use mouth rinses frequently to hinder the growth of bacteria and avoid infection. Check jewelry periodically to make sure it is secure. You don't want to accidentally swallow it! Remove your piercing and use a mouth guard before playing sports, especially contact sports."" "
Bedtime bottles,"'Even though baby teeth are temporary, they are  essential for proper ''nutrition'' and preparing the way for the future permanent teeth in the mouth. Baby teeth are also still susceptible to decay. Giving your baby a bottle at night at bedtime increases the risk of dental decay. The decay can be so extreme that it has been given the name “''Baby Bottle Tooth Decay''.” Milk contains ''sugar'' that feeds bacteria in the mouth. The bacteria produce acids that damage teeth leading to dental decay. Allowing your baby to continuously ''sleep'"" at night with a milk bottle allows the mouth bacteria many uninterrupted hours to damage your little one's teeth. Give your baby a bottle of milk well before the baby goes to bed and afterwards, plan on cleaning the teeth and mouth with gauze or a ""'toothbrush''.'""Start good habits early in life to protect your baby's ""'oral health'"". Establish a bedtime routine that doesn't involve a bottle of milk. A warm bath and soothing music may be all your baby needs to promote sleep. If your baby still wants a bottle, filling it with water instead may still provide some comfort.""""Start good habits early in life to protect your baby's oral health. Establish a  bedtime routine that doesn't involve a bottle of milk. A warm bath and soothing music may be all your baby needs to promote sleep. If your baby still wants a bottle, filling it with water instead may still provide some comfort."" "
Cough drops,"'Cough'' drops are meant to help calm your ''cough'' and soothe your throat, but they may do so at the expense of your teeth if they have ''sugar''. Because they are slow to dissolve in your mouth, cough drops bathe your teeth in sugar, which feeds bacteria. This sets you up for enamel erosion and possible ''tooth decay''. If you need a cough drop, opt for different kinds that are sugar free.'""The health of your teeth isn't the only thing to consider when choosing a cough drop. Although cough drops are generally considered safe while ""'pregnant'' or ''breastfeeding'', check with your health care professional before taking any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medication. Having some tea with a bit of honey is another time-honored way to soothe your cough.' "
Gummy candy,"'Do you love ''chocolate'', lollipops, gum, and chewy candy? Frankly, none of them is great for your teeth, but sticky, chewy types are especially the worst offenders. Gummy candy, jelly beans, and caramel stick to your teeth and stay there in the crevices until they dissolve. This provides an ongoing sugar feast for bacteria in your mouth that produce acids that eat away at your tooth enamel.''If you must have candy, opt for sugar-free options. Better yet, choose healthy foods to snack on instead. Fruit can provide you with a bit of sugar to satisfy your sweet tooth while giving you a dose of nutrients that are actually good for you. Fruit supplies you with:' vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber that your body needs."
Drinking too much soda,"""Soda may be public enemy number one for your health and your teeth. It's a source of high sugar and liquid calories that are bad for your smile as well as your waistline. Sugary soda increases the risk of tooth decay and soda is also high in phosphoric and citric acids, which can eat through tooth enamel. It's best to skip soda all together. If you must indulge, sip it through a straw to minimize contact with your teeth. Rinse your mouth out with water immediately after drinking soda to wash away sugar and acid. However, wait 30 minutes after drinking soda before brushing your teeth. After drinking soda, the enamel on your teeth is softer and more easily damaged so you don't want to do further damage by brushing right after.""'What are other potential side effects of drinking soda? Soda drinking increases the risks of both ''diabetes'' and ''obesity'"". Think you're off the hook by choosing ""'diet'' sodas? Not so fast. ''Diet'' sodas have health risks, too. Daily consumption of diet soda has been associated both ''metabolic syndrome'' and type 2 diabetes. ''Metabolic syndrome'' is a set of risk factors that include ''high blood pressure'', ''abdominal fat'', high levels of ''cholesterol'', and ''high blood sugar''.' "
Opening stuff with your teeth,"""We've all done it, but using your teeth to open a bag of chips or wrench the cap off of a bottle is a really bad idea. Using your teeth to open things can lead to ""'tooth damage'"" like chips, fractures, and other kinds of damage. If you're lucky, a damaged tooth may be repaired with just a filling. If the damage is severe or very deep, you may need a ""'root canal'' and a ''crown'' to preserve the look and function of your tooth.'""Remember this cautionary tale the next time you're tempted to use your teeth to rip open a bag of chips. Reach for a pair of scissors, bottle opener, or other implement instead to open that package or bottle. Save your teeth from unnecessary potential damage."" "
Sports drinks,"'Sipping a sports drink after being active may seem like a good thing to do, but think again. Just like soda, sports ''drinks'' contain sugar and acid that can damage your teeth. These drinks damage your teeth for up to 20 minutes after you drink them. Admittedly, sports drinks have less sugar than soda, but because they are less sweet, you may be inclined to drink more of it. This increased sugar intake can also raise your risk of ''diabetes'' and obesity.'""To preserve and protect your teeth, choose plain water instead of acidic, sugary sports drinks to rehydrate. If you do drink a sports drink, rinse your mouth out with water immediately afterward. Then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. The acids in sports drinks soften tooth enamel, so if you brush immediately after sipping the drink, you risk further damage to your teeth. Sports drinks are no better for your teeth and waistline than soda. Remember that and don't buy into the marketing hype that tries to tell you otherwise."" "
Fruit juice,"'One survey found that adults grossly underestimate the amount of sugar in fruit drinks, sometimes by as much as 50%. The sugar content of some fruit juices is equivalent to that found in soda. In terms of ''dental health'"", fruit juice's high sugar content increases the risk of tooth decay. Citrus juices such as orange juice and lemonade are very acidic and contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel. Additionally, the same survey found that liquid calories comprised about 25% of the daily calories consumed by those participating in the study.""""The sugar, acid, and calories in fruit juice aren't good for your teeth and body. You can get your fruit fix in much healthier ways:"" You can enjoy the taste of juice without the wallop to your teeth and waistline by adding just a splash of juice to a glass of mineral water. Drink plain water with a squeeze of lemon or lime. Enjoy whole fruits that are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are good for you."
Potato chips,'High-starch foods stick to teeth and remain longer in the mouth than non-starchy foods. Potato chips are a perfect example. They remain on your teeth long after eating them and the results are similar to constant snacking. The starches serve as food for bacteria in your mouth. Bacteria produce acid and the acid wears down your enamel and sets the stage for tooth decay.''Use these tips to protect your teeth after eating potato chips:' Eat a crunchy apple or carrot to help remove starches stuck to your teeth. Brush or floss after you eat to remove food particles and minimize plaque formation.
Constant snacking,"""Constant snacking during the day means your teeth are exposed to more sugar. Bacteria in the mouth feed on that sugar producing acids that can erode tooth enamel. Frequent snacking contributes not only to tooth decay, but also to an increased risk of obesity. Follow these snacking do's and dont's:"" If you're hungry between meals, resist the urge to reach for sticky, starchy snacks like potato chips and pretzels. Forego liquid calories, too. Drinking more soda or alcohol bathes your teeth in sugar for bacteria to feed on. The best smile-friendly drink to reach for if you're thirsty is water. Curb your hunger by munching on cleansing-type snacks like carrots, apples, and celery. They will help remove food particles from your teeth."
Chewing on pencils,"'Chewing on pencils or other objects is a bad habit many people have. People may chew on pencils, erasers, bottle caps, and other things. The behavior is bad for teeth because it puts unnecessary stress on your teeth and could lead to a tooth chip or fracture. Chewing on foreign objects may also introduce potentially-dangerous bacteria into the mouth. This habit may also injure the gums and other soft tissues in the mouth, causing them to become swollen.''If you have the urge to chew, choose sugarless gum containing xylitol that promotes saliva flow and is actually good for your teeth.' "
Drinking coffee,"'Coffee may be the fuel you use to start your day, but ''caffeine'' in your morning brew can contribute to ''dry mouth'' and tooth decay. Caffeine stains teeth and inhibits saliva flow. Saliva neutralizes acids in the mouth and helps clear food particles from teeth. Combat ''dry mouth'' from caffeine by drinking more water throughout the day. And if you add sugar to coffee, your teeth may suffer for it. If you indulge in multiple coffee refills throughout the day, your risk of ''cavities'' increases even more.''If you must have coffee, follow these tips.' Choose decaf varieties to skip caffeine that can lead to dry mouth. If you must have sweetener, choose a sugar free kind that won't harm your teeth. Chew sugarless gum containing xylitol which is proven to reduce the risk of dental carries and stimulate saliva flow."
Smoking,"'Tobacco'' is bad for your teeth, oral tissues, and body. Here are just a few ways that ''smoking''*tobacco use are bad for you:''Several strategies are available to help you stop smoking. Speak to your doctor about patches, medications, and other treatments that can help you kick the habit.' It causes dry mouth which allows plaque to build up. Smoking is a risk factor for gum disease which is the leading cause of tooth loss among adults. Tobacco use stains teeth and increases the risk of tooth decay. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to lose teeth. Smoking and tobacco use are associated with increased rates of oral and lung cancers."
Drinking red wine,"'Several substances in red wine contribute to staining. Tooth enamel is not totally smooth. It contains small cracks that are susceptible to stains. Chromogens, acids, and tannins are three components of red wine that seep into cracks in tooth enamel, causing stains. Chromogens give red wine its deep, rich, red color. Acids erode tooth enamel. Tannins promote dryness that allows red pigments to bind to and discolor teeth.''You can do things to keep red wine stains from forming on your teeth. Eat a protein-rich snack, like cheese, when you drink wine. Rinse your mouth out with water after you imbibe. CChewing gum afterwards can help, too. These activities promote saliva flow that can help neutralize acids in the mouth.''Daily wine consumption may provide health benefits for some people. In one study, people who had well-controlled ''type 2 diabetes'' who drank red wine every night experienced moderate benefits in their cholesterol numbers. However, not everyone should drink wine before bed. Women should not drink red wine or other alcoholic beverages while pregnant. The risks and benefits of alcohol consumption differ slightly for men and for women. Speak with your healthcare professional if you want to know if wine consumption is a healthy practice for you.' "
Drinking white wine,"""Red wine is not the only kind that can do damage to teeth. One study suggests that white wine has the potential to cause more severe enamel erosion than red wine. White wine strips more calcium from teeth than red wine. White wines contain the same damaging tannins and acids that red wines do. The food you eat after drinking white wine affects staining, too. Skip the beet salad immediately after you've had wine. Wine primes your teeth to pick up whatever pigments are in the foods you're about to eat. The same rules apply for drinking white wine as compared to red. Women should not consume wine and other types of alcohol while pregnant."" "
Binge eating,"'Binge eating disorder'' is a condition in which the sufferer consumes vast amounts of food and feels unable to stop eating.  A person with the disorder often chooses high-calorie foods and drinks to binge on, often at night. The behavior is damaging to health, and the excess sugar is harmful to teeth. ''Bulimia'' is a similar disorder involving bingeing but the sufferer also vomits to purge what he or she has eaten. Stomach contents are highly acidic and very damaging to teeth. Symptoms and signs of ''eating disorders'' may include ''depression'', ''weight gain'', and feelings of shame and being out of control. The causes of binge eating disorders and other eating disorders are complex.''People who have an eating disorder can seek help to control their behavior in order to safeguard their health and teeth. Recovery is possible and treatment is available to help overcome the disorder.' "
What is proton beam therapy and for what is it used?,"'Proton beam therapy is a type of ''radiation therapy'' that uses protons instead of ''X-rays'' (photons) and can be used for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ''liver cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' or HCC). Protons are positively charged particles that, produced with high energy, can destroy ''cancer'' cells. Proton beam therapy is able to deliver targeted high doses of protons to a defined local area, minimizing damage to surrounding tissue and reducing side effects. The ideal patient with HCC for this treatment has only a small (less than 5 centimeters in diameter) solitary lesion (''tumor'') though benefit in a few patients with larger tumors has been described.''Proton therapy may be used by itself, or along with other treatments including standard ''radiation'' therapy, surgery, ''chemotherapy'', and/or immunotherapy. It also may be used when surgery is contraindicated.''Proton beam therapy is used for patients who have tumors that are solid with well-defined borders that have not spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body.' "
Why is proton beam therapy used?,"'Proton beam therapy is used to treat several types of solid tumors including HCC. Proton beam therapy allows physicians to better control what tissues are affected by the radiation and, at the same, reduce damage to healthy surrounding tissue and vital organs.''X-ray therapy or traditional radiation causes more damage to the healthy tissues surrounding a targeted tumor while proton beam therapy radiation is able to more precisely target cancerous tumors.''Proton beam therapy may be useful in treating ''cancer'' that is located in a critical area where it is important to preserve the surrounding tissue as much as possible (for example, tumors in the brain, spinal cord, or in the eye). It may also be quite beneficial in children because standard radiation can damage developing organs and have long-term effects in children. Proton beam therapy minimizes the damage and long-term effects.' "
How is proton beam therapy done?,"'Proton beam therapy is typically done in an outpatient setting. Prior to the start of proton beam therapy, the patient undergoes a CT or ''MRI'' scan to localize the exact site of the ''cancer''. The scan is performed with the patient sitting or lying in a device that immobilizes the part of the body that will undergo therapy. Based on the scan, plans are made to deliver the proton beam to the cancer. For each session of therapy, the patient is placed again in the immobilization device. In addition, X-rays or scans are taken before every session to make sure the patient is in the exact same position so the protons hit the tumor and not the surrounding healthy tissue.''The proton beam is invisible and painless. The number of treatment sessions depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Therapy usually is conducted 5 days per week, usually for 15 days. Proton beam therapy sessions last about 15 to 30 minutes. ' "
How effective is this therapy in treating liver cancer?,"'Proton beam therapy is a relatively new treatment modality. There is not yet much data regarding the efficacy of this treatment for ''liver'' cancer. Preliminary data from the U.S. suggest similar effectiveness as seen with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or ablation (using radiofrequency or ''alcohol'') for the treatment of HCC. It is not known whether this type of radiation treatment can consistently prolong the life of the patient.''A study from Loma Linda University Medical Center showed proton beam therapy was effective in treating cancerous lesions in the liver up to 10 centimeters. Patients with one lesion smaller than 5 centimeters or up to three lesions smaller than 3 centimeters (this size definition is called the Milan criteria) have better survival rates than patients with larger tumors. The same study found that patients who had tumors within the Milan criteria that were treated with proton beam therapy had a 48% survival rate over 3 years. Those whose tumors fell outside the definition of the Milan criteria had 3-year survival rates of 12%.''Another study at the University of Tsukuba in Japan looked at the safety and efficacy of using proton beam therapy to treat metastatic liver cancer (cancer that had spread to the liver from elsewhere in the body), and it found the treatment to be both safe and effective. Those who had cancer only in the liver had better outcomes than those whose cancer had spread more widely.' "
What are the potential risks and benefits of proton beam therapy?,"'There are some benefits to proton beam therapy versus standard radiation therapy including:''Proton beam therapy does have some drawbacks:'   The treatment delivers up to 60% less radiation to the tissues surrounding the tumor, reducing damage to healthy tissues. It can allow for a higher dose of radiation to the tumor, which can increase the chance of destroying all of the targeted tumor cells. Side effects during and after treatment may be less severe, including a reduced incidence of low blood counts, fatigue, and nausea. Faster recovery occurs following treatment. 
 Proton beam therapy requires expensive and specialized equipment that few medical centers have. As of 2015, there are only 16 proton therapy centers in the U.S. with 10 more under construction, according to The National Association for Proton Therapy location map. Proton beam therapy may cost more than standard radiation therapy, and some insurance providers may not cover it. The National Association for Proton Therapy states Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) are more likely to cover proton beam therapy than Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Proton beam therapy works best on cancer that is localized to one area with well-defined borders and has not spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body. It may not be effective in treating all types of cancer. Proton beam therapy use still remains controversial. Many studies have not proven it more effective or beneficial than conventional radiation therapy."
What are the potential side effects of proton beam therapy?,"'The potential side effects from proton beam therapy treatment are the same as conventional radiation therapy. Side effects may vary depending on the part of the body being treated and the size of the tumor. If patients also are receiving chemotherapy along with proton beam therapy they may have additional side effects from the chemotherapy.''The proton beam therapy procedure is painless, but patients may experience side effects including ''fatigue'' and skin irritation (such as swelling, redness, dryness, peeling, or ''blistering''). There also still may be some damage to healthy tissue.' "
What research is being done on proton beam therapy?,"'A study is underway at Loma Linda University looking at proton beam therapy for HCC and other tumors. The study compares proton beam therapy outcomes with results in patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a more standard treatment for cancer, particularly HCC.''There are some studies being done comparing X-ray radiotherapy treatments to proton treatments, but so far no studies have shown proton beam therapy to be more effective at controlling cancer than traditional radiation therapy.''Other studies are aimed at developing a scanning proton beam for treating large and irregular shaped tumors.''There are a number of ''clinical trials'' looking at how proton beam therapy might affect certain specific types of ''cancers'', including breast, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, thoracic, and pediatric cancers.' "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "
What should I know about itching?," The medical term for itching is pruritus. Bacterial and fungal infections, bites and stings, infestations, chronic diseases, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, allergic reactions, sun exposure, and dry skin, and other skin disorders and health conditions all may be causes of itching. Anti-itch creams and lotions containing camphor, menthol, phenol, pramoxine (Caladryl, Tronolane), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or benzocaine can bring relief. Some cases of itching will respond to corticosteroid medications. It is important to avoid scratching when possible to prevent worsening of the condition and disruption of the skin that could lead to bacterial infection. If itching persists, worsens, or is associated with skin lesions, go see a health care professional."
What is an itch?,"'Itch is an irritation in the skin that elicits an urge to scratch. Itchiness is a problem that everyone experiences, and the symptom can be localized (limited to one area of the body) or generalized (occurring all over the body or in several different areas). Sometimes, depending upon the underlying cause, itching may be worse at night. In medical terminology, itching is known as ''pruritus''.''Generalized itch that occurs all over the body is often more difficult to treat than localized itch. Itches can also occur with or without skin lesions (''bumps'', ''blisters'', ''rash'', redness, or abnormalities that can be seen on the skin). An itch that is accompanied by a visible skin abnormality should be evaluated by a physician and, in some cases, by a dermatologist since the problem is likely to be a condition that requires specialized medical treatment (for example, ''eczema'', ''scabies'', etc.).' "
What are associated symptoms and signs of itching (pruritus)?,"'Depending upon the underlying cause, itchiness may be associated with other symptoms and signs. Most commonly, these associated findings include skin lesions such as ''rash'', blisters, bumps, or redness of the affected area. Dryness of the skin is a common cause of itch. Itching of skin can lead to tears in the skin (excoriations) from scratching. Less commonly, generalized itching all over the body can be a sign of chronic medical conditions such as ''liver disease''. In these situations, there may be no changes to the appearance of the skin.'  "
What causes itching?,"'Pruritus can be caused by many conditions. ''Stress'', ''anxiety'', or other emotional problems can cause itching. ''Stress'' also can aggravate itch from other causes. ''Dry skin'' (''xerosis'') is perhaps the most frequent cause of itch without a rash. Many people also report ''sunburn'' itch following prolonged exposure to UV ''radiation'' from the sun along with the ''pain'' of ''sunburn''. Other causes of generalized itching that may not produce a rash or specific skin changes include metabolic and hormone disorders (for examples, ''kidney disease'', ''hyperthyroidism''), ''cancers'' (for example, ''lymphoma''), reactions to ''drugs'', interruptions in bile flow (''cholestasis'') from ''liver disease'', and diseases of the blood (for example, ''polycythemia'' rubra vera). Itching is common with allergic reactions, such as ''food allergies'' or other types of ''allergy''. Itching can also result from ''insect stings'' and bites such as mosquito or ''flea bites''.''Psoriasis'' is a chronic cause of ''skin inflammation'' that can also be associated with itching. Patients with ''psoriasis'' typically develop red, elevated, scaling plaques of dry, ''itchy'' skin. ''Atopic dermatitis'' is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that usually starts in childhood. Itching, rash, and thickening of the skin over time are characteristic symptoms of ''atopic dermatitis''. This is considered to be a type of ''allergy'' (an immune system reaction against a foreign substance) that is associated with inhaled ''allergies'' (''hay fever'') and is chronic.''Infections and infestations of the skin are another cause of itch. Genital itching or ''anal itching'', which may accompany burning and ''pain'', in men and women can occur as a result of genital infections such as ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs''). ''Vaginal itching'' is sometimes referred to as feminine itching, and sexually transmitted diseases can also cause ''anal itching'' and pain. Vaginal yeast infections are another cause of vaginal itching. Other common infectious causes of itch include a yeast (fungal) infection of the crotch (''tinea cruris'') commonly known as ''jock itch'', ''psoriasis'', and ''ringworm'' of the body (''tinea corporis'""). Another type of parasitic infection resulting in an itchy sensation is the so-called swimmer's itch. Swimmer's itch, also called ""'cercarial dermatitis'', is a skin rash caused by an ''allergic reaction'' to infection with certain parasites of birds and mammals that are released from infected snails in fresh and saltwater. Itch may also result from skin infestation by ''body lice'', including ''head lice'' and ''pubic lice''. ''Scabies'' is a highly ''contagious'' skin condition caused by an infestation by the itch ''mite'' ''Sarcoptes scabiei'' that is known to cause an intense itch that is particularly severe at night.'  "
What causes itching? (Continued),"'Brachioradial pruritus is a neurologic condition that results in intense itching of the arms. It usually develops on the forearm over the head of the brachioradialis muscle, but it can occur anywhere on the upper extremities. This is often caused by a ''pinched nerve'' in the neck.''Itching can also result from other conditions that affect the nerves or nervous system, such as ''diabetes'', ''shingles'' (''herpes zoster''), or ''multiple sclerosis''.''Irritation of the skin from contact with fabrics, ''cosmetics'', or other substances can lead to itching that may be accompanied by rash, known as ''contact dermatitis''. ''Poison ivy'' is another example of contact ''dermatitis''. Reactions to drugs or medications can also result in widespread itching that may be accompanied by a rash or ''hives''. Sometimes women report that they experience generalized itching during ''pregnancy'' or a worsening of the conditions that normally cause itching. Contact dermatitis from ''poison ivy'', ''poison oak'', or ''poison sumac'' (due to contact with the oily sap urushiol) or ''allergy'' to nickel are also common causes of localized itching.''Itching of the ''scalp'' can be caused by a number of conditions, including ''dandruff'', psoriasis, or ''seborrheic dermatitis''.''Most people who have itching do not have a serious underlying condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose itching?,"'As with any condition, a careful medical history and physical examination will suggest to your health care provider the particular diagnostic tests that may be needed to learn the cause of itching. Some common causes like ''dry skin'' or sunburn may be obvious, while causes such as chronic systemic diseases or conditions may require blood or imaging tests to identify. If a skin condition is responsible for the itch, sometimes a scraping or biopsy may be performed to identify the condition. Nevertheless, many common ''rashes'' and skin ailments have a characteristic symptom or appearance that may suggest the correct diagnosis.' "
What types of health care specialists treat itching?,"'Because the causes of pruritic skin are so varied, many different medical practitioners can be involved in treating itching. Itching is commonly treated by specialists in family medicine, internal medicine, ''pediatrics'', or dermatology. Itching related to allergy may be treated by an allergist or immunologist. Itching related to ''STDs'' may be managed by a gynecologist or ''urologist''. An obstetrician-gynecologist may treat women suffering from itching during pregnancy or ''vaginitis''. People with itching due to chronic diseases may be treated by the specialists who manage these conditions, such as endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, oncologists, hematologists, neurologists, and infectious-disease specialists. Some causes of itching are treated by emergency-medicine specialists.' "
Should people scratch the itch?,"""Itching usually prompts scratching, which can sometimes lead to a vicious itch-scratch cycle. Scratching can initially feel satisfying, but prolonged scratching just leaves you with irritated skin that can still itch and often worsens the itching itself. Since scratching provides only temporary relief and doesn't promote healing of the underlying problem, it is best to avoid scratching if at all possible. If scratching breaks open the skin, bacterial infection can set in. This is known as secondary infection. And if scratching continues for many months or years, the area that is scratched may develop thickened skin (lichenification) or pigmentation that darkens the area.""'The best way to allow irritated skin to heal is to stop scratching it. However, willpower often is not enough since the urge to scratch can be compelling. The following sections discuss some general measures and home remedies to help to stop scratching and control itch, regardless of the cause.'  "
What are topical itch treatments? Are there any home remedies for itching?,"'Topical itch treatments, those used on the skin, include ''cold'' applications, creams, and lotions.''Cold applications'': Because cold and itch travel along the same nerve fibers, the use of cold can ""jam the circuits"" and deaden itch. Methods of applying cold include the following:''Hot water'' (in the shower, for instance) feels good temporarily, but it can leave you feeling even itchier later. Therefore, the use of hot water is not recommended.'   Cool water, either by running tap water over the affected area or placing a cold clean washcloth on the skin Cool showers A cool bath; products that contain colloidal oatmeal are available over the counter as an itch relief bath Ice packs, either the commercially available type or ice cubes in a plastic bag"
What are topical itch treatments? Are there any home remedies for itching? (Continued),"'You can apply these products over and over, every few minutes if needed. These preparations help numb the nerve endings and stop you from a frenzy of scratching, which leaves the skin raw, sore, and even itchier.''Although hydrocortisone-containing creams and lotions are often promoted as itch reducers, this ingredient only helps an itch that is caused by a rash responsive to cortisone, such as the skin diseases ''eczema'' and ''seborrhea''. Since OTC hydrocortisone-containing creams and lotions are weak (even so-called ""maximum-strength"" products contain only 1%), they aren\'t too helpful for itch even in responsive conditions. When pruritus is caused by irritations of other sorts (''insect bites'"", for instance), hydrocortisone doesn't help much at all. If you use hydrocortisone for 10 days and experience no improvement, you should go see a physician to help determine the cause of your itch."" Camphor Menthol Phenol Pramoxine Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Benzocaine (or one of the other ""caine"" anesthetics)"
What are oral medications that treat itch?,"'Traditionally, ''antihistamines'' are used to treat itch. Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax), and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton and others). These medicines can induce drowsiness in many people and must be used with care before driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Although antihistamines may help relieve itchy skin, they seem to do so mainly by helping people fall asleep and avoid scratching at night. If falling or staying asleep is not your main problem, you may want to try one of the nonsedating antihistamines. ''Loratadine'' (''Claritin'') and ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra'' and others) are examples of newer second-generation antihistamines that are available without a prescription. The second-generation antihistamines do not have the sedating effects of the older first-generation antihistamines but they are not very effective in quelling the itch.' "
Is it possible to prevent itching?,"'Itching can be prevented only to the extent that the underlying cause(s) of the itching sensation can be prevented. For example, careful use of ''sunscreen'' products can prevent the itching associated with sunburn. Keeping well hydrated and using moisturizers can prevent the itch associated with dry skin. It is also possible to take preventive measures to avoid contagious conditions that may be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact like sexually transmitted diseases, or tick or ''bug bites'', or ''lice'' infestations that may be the sources of itching. Chronic itch associated with serious conditions like ''skin cancers'' and ''liver'' or kidney disease cannot typically be prevented.' "
When should the doctor be consulted for itching (pruritus)?,"""If home treatment isn't helping, scratching is affecting the skin being scratched (infection, lichenification [thickening and scarring], or pigmentation), or the itch is disturbing one's ""'sleep'"", consult a doctor to ascertain what's causing the itching. A doctor can also prescribe stronger cortisone-based creams (for eczemas and ""'allergies'') and prescription-grade antihistamines, if necessary, or treat the underlying condition that is causing the itch.' "
What are possible complications of itching?,"'As mentioned previously, a secondary bacterial infection of the skin is perhaps the most common complication of itching. This occurs not as a result of the itch but as a result of the scratching and associated skin damage. Antibiotics may be required to treat a bacterial infection of the skin. Itching itself is unlikely to lead to other complications, although some of the underlying diseases that cause itching (see above) are associated with complications specific to the disease itself.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for itching?,"'Itching itself is not associated with long-term skin problems or harm, and most cases of itch are temporary and resolve on their own or with topical or oral treatments. Itching that is associated with a serious condition may persist if the condition worsens or it may be managed with medications.' "
What is a PSA test?,"'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a substance produced only by certain cells within the male prostate gland. Biochemically, it belongs to the protease family of kallikrein and is also known as human kallikrein 3 (hK3). PSA is released by the prostate into the semen where it acts to liquefy the semen following ejaculation. Most of the PSA produced by the prostate gland is carried out of the body in semen, but a very small amount escapes into the bloodstream, so PSA is normally found in low amounts (nanograms per milliliter or ng/mL) in the blood. PSA has also been found in some breast tissue in women, although these amounts of PSA are very low.''If the PSA level is high for your age or is steadily increasing (with or without an abnormal physical exam), further investigation, namely a prostate biopsy, may be recommended. The health care provider should consider other health risk factors of prostate cancer such as family history, prostate volume, the presence of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), urinary symptoms, rectal exam findings, ethnicity, and medications that you are taking before recommending the biopsy. At this time, prostate biopsy for pathology review is the only way to determine if prostate cancer or other abnormal cells are present in the prostate.' "
How is the PSA count measured?,"'PSA is measured by a simple blood test that does not require fasting or special preparation. Since the amount of PSA in the blood is very low, detection of it requires a very sensitive type of technology (monoclonal antibody technique). The PSA protein can exist in the blood by itself (known as free PSA) or be bound with other substances (known as bound or complexed PSA). PSA is mostly bound to three substances: alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), and albumin. Total PSA is the sum of the free and the bound forms. The total PSA is what is measured with the standard PSA test. More recently, a precursor of PSA, proenzyme PSA ([-2] proenzyme PSA), has been identified, which may be helpful in determining prostate cancer risk in men with a PSA under 10 and a normal digital rectal examination. The prostate health index (PHI) is a new approved test that measures the total PSA, free PSA, and [-2] proenzyme PSA. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines include use of PHI as a secondary test option for men making decisions about an initial or repeat biopsy. The 4K score test is another test that incorporates PSA. The 4K score uses a prediction model based on clinical variables (age, prior biopsy, digital rectal examination results) and laboratory measurements of total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and a related protein known as hK2 (human kallikrein-related peptidase 2).' "
What causes elevated PSA levels?,"'It is believed that elevation of PSA in the blood is due to its release into the circulation (bloodstream) because of a breakdown (disruption) of the prostate cellular architecture (structure). However, the reasons are not fully known. A high PSA level can occur in the setting of different prostate diseases/conditions including prostate cancer but also as a result of noncancerous causes. It is important to note that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer but to prostatic tissue, and therefore PSA elevations may indicate the presence of any kind of prostate disease. Common benign causes of PSA elevation include ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' or BPH (an age-related, natural enlargement of the prostate, secondary to a noncancerous growth of prostate glandular cells), ''prostatitis'' (inflammation or infection of the prostate), and ''urinary tract infection''. In fact, PSA elevation can also occur with prostate manipulation such as ejaculation, prostate examination (digital rectal examination), medical instrumentation (cystoscopy), ''urinary retention'' or Foley catheter placement, and prostate biopsy. It is also thought that vigorous ''exercise'' that may affect the prostate, such as bicycle riding, can increase the PSA. It is for these reasons that patients should abstain from sex one to two days prior to PSA testing. Some physicians may recommend repeating a PSA test to ensure that the elevation is not related to these noncancerous causes.' "
What can lower the PSA test results?,"'Medications commonly taken to treat benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) such as ''finasteride'' (''Proscar''), ''dutasteride'' (''Avodart''), and a combination of dutasteride and ''tamsulosin'' (Jalyn) can decrease the PSA by about 50% within six to 12 months of starting their use. Another medication used to treat ''fungal infections'', ''ketoconazole'', can also lower PSA levels. Lastly, herbal ''supplements'' such as saw palmetto and those containing phytoestrogens, which are plant-derived chemicals with estrogen-like effects, can also lower the PSA level. It is important to tell your health care provider all the medications, both prescription and nonprescription, as well as any herbal preparations or health ''supplements'' that you are taking.' "
What is the accuracy of the PSA test?,"'One of the limitations of the PSA test is that PSA is not specific to prostate cancer and that it can be affected by several common conditions such as benign enlargement of the prostate, inflammation, and infection of the prostate. Furthermore, there is some variability in PSA results when using different testing equipment. One study showed that 25% (one in four) men who had an initial PSA result between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL had a normal test result when it was repeated.''Limitations of PSA testing include a high false-positive rate (a test that incorrectly indicates that a particular condition is present). In fact, only about 25% of men who have an elevated PSA between 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL will have prostate cancer identified on prostate biopsy and 75% will not. If one uses a lower cutoff of 3.1 ng/mL, PSA had a sensitivity (the proportion of men who test positive for the condition among those that have the condition) of 32% and specificity (the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as negative) of 87% for identifying prostate cancer.''Another concern in addition to the low specificity in detecting the presence of prostate cancer is the inability of the test to discriminate between a more aggressive, high-risk, prostate cancer from one that is less likely to cause harm, or a low-risk prostate cancer. This is thought to lead to overtreatment in up to 50% of men with prostate cancer.' "
What are normal results for the PSA test?,"'The ""normal"" PSA serum concentration remains a debate, however, for most laboratory readings, it should be less than 4.0 ng/mL. The prostate gland generally increases in size and produces more PSA with increasing age, so it is normal to have lower levels in young men and higher levels in older men. Due to these normal changes in PSA with age, the concept of age-adjusted PSA normals have been described and recommended. What is considered to be a normal PSA level also depends on ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. Once an initial PSA has been obtained, the change in the PSA over time, the PSA velocity, plays a role in clinical decision making. It is felt that the PSA velocity over a year should be less than 0.75 ng/mL. For example, a man 50 to 59 years of age with a PSA level that is 0.5 ng/mL one year and increases to 2.5 ng/mL the following year, may be viewed as having a normal PSA level, but the rate of change in his PSA (PSA velocity) would be worrisome for an underlying prostate cancer. Lastly, as the size of the prostate gland may affect the PSA level, PSA density (PSA level divided by prostate volume) can also be a helpful number. A PSA density of 0.18 or less appears to be an optimal number.'  "
What are age-specific reference ranges for serum PSA?,"'The use of age-specific PSA ranges for the detection of prostate cancer is helpful to avoid unnecessary investigations in older men with larger prostate glands (typically walnut-sized). Median PSA value for men aged 40 to 49 years is 0.7 ng/mL and for men 50 to 59 years is 0.9 ng/mL. Not all studies have agreed that this is better than simply using a level of 4.0 ng/mL as the highest normal value. Nevertheless, due to the age-related growth of the prostate, the concept of adjusting the cutoff values based on age has helped reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in older men to improve early prostate cancer detection. Below are the suggested age-adjusted values based on age and race.' "
How is PSA used for early detection of prostate cancer?,"'Clinically localized prostate cancer (prostate cancer confirmed to the prostate gland) generally does not usually cause any symptoms. In general, most men with organ-confined (early, localized) ''prostate cancers'' have PSA values that are typically less than 20 ng/mL. Once PSA values are greater than 20 ng/mL, the risk for metastatic (distant spread) disease increases significantly. Men with early prostate cancer usually feel perfectly well and have no urinary symptoms related to the prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of prostate cancer cells in a prostate biopsy specimen, elevated PSA remains the most common indication for prostate biopsy. An abnormal prostate on digital rectal examination is also an indication for prostate biopsy, and thus ''prostate cancer screening'' should not be solely PSA-based.''It is the hope that the ability to identify changes like increases in PSA or abnormalities on rectal examination will allow for early detection of prostate cancer and allow for close monitoring (active surveillance) or definitive treatment to prevent the development of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-related deaths. However, given the sensitivity of PSA testing, the trade-off of evaluating those individuals with an elevated PSA is the possibility of an unnecessary prostate biopsy and associated risks (infection, ''blood in the urine''/ejaculate) and ''anxiety''. In addition, current ''prostate cancer screening'' is limited by its ability to identify individuals with high-risk prostate cancer, prior to prostate biopsy.''Limitations with PSA testing have led to a search for alternative biomarkers. More recently, other novel biomarkers and tests (PCA3, 4K, PHI, as well as prostate ''MRI'' imaging) have emerged as additional adjuncts to patient counseling. Unfortunately, none can confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Nor can these tests, including PSA, allow one to predict prior to biopsy if an individual has an aggressive form of prostate cancer.''Although not perfectly specific as a biomarker, the level of PSA has been demonstrated to be an independent variable to predict the presence of prostate cancer. In fact, the higher the level, the more likely prostate cancer is present. An abnormality in results will usually require additional testing. However, definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer depends on the presence of cancer cells obtained either from prostate biopsy or surgical specimens.''In general, PSA levels greater than 4 ng/mL are usually considered suspicious. As levels increase above 10.0 ng/mL, the probability of cancer increases dramatically. However, not all men with prostate cancer have elevated PSA levels. It is known that a small but significant number of people with prostate cancer can present with a PSA level of less than 4.0 ng/mL. This is why health care professionals may use lower thresholds to decide when to do a biopsy, depending on the presence of risk factors (for example, family history of prostate cancer, ethnicity) and other factors such as PSA density and PSA velocity.''For an average man over the age of 50 with a normal digital rectal exam, the average probability of having prostate cancer detectable by prostate biopsy according to his PSA level is as follows:''Since the likelihood of having prostate cancer increases proportionately with PSA level, there is no threshold below which a man can be reassured that prostate cancer is not present.''In order to improve the specificity of the PSA test in the early detection of prostate cancer, several modifications of the serum PSA value have been described including the ratio of free/total PSA and the measurement of PSA change over time.' "
What is the cost of the PSA test?,"""The PSA blood test is frequently covered by insurance, especially for men who are 50 years of age and older. PSA blood tests costs $20-$50. However, if it is obtained in the doctor's office during a visit to the doctor there may be an additional charge of $25-$100 for the office visit. There are PSA blood tests available for home use. The home blood test comes with a lancet to prick your finger and squeeze out a sample of blood, a kit to collect the blood, a bandage, and an address or prepaid mailer to return to the laboratory. Not all of the advertised home blood tests are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). You can access the FDA web site to make sure you are using an approved test."" "
What is free/total PSA ratio?,"'Although prostate cancer cells do not produce more PSA than benign prostate tissue, the PSA produced from cancerous cells appears to escape an enzymatic processing that cleaves the bond between PSA and the protein that binds to it. Therefore, men with prostate cancer have a greater fraction of complexed, or bound, serum PSA and a lower amount of unbound (free) PSA compared with men without prostate cancer. Therefore, the free/total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) can be additionally used in clinical practice to discriminate between PSA elevation secondary to benign prostatic disease and ''prostate cancers''. This is particularly useful for patients with a total PSA level between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a negative normal rectal exam to help the health care provider to decide if a biopsy is necessary. In one study, prostate cancer was found in 56% of men with a free/total PSA less than 0.10 (10%) but in only 8% of men with free/total PSA greater than 0.25 (25%). Nevertheless, the concept of free PSA must be used with caution as several factors may influence the free/total PSA ratio such as temperature and prostate size. Furthermore, the free PSA measurement is not clinically useful for patients with total serum PSA values less than 10.0 ng/mL or in the follow-up of patients with known prostate cancer.''More recently, a chemical precursor of PSA has been identified, [-2] proenzyme PSA. Preliminary studies show some promise that the level of this chemical, [-2] proenzyme PSA, may help differentiate between prostate cancer and benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH) in men with a normal rectal examination and a PSA between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL.' "
What is PSA velocity and PSA doubling time?,"'Change in PSA levels over time can be used to assess both cancer risk and aggressiveness of the particular ''tumor''. Most urologists use these PSA metrics to help drive patient counseling and care. PSA velocity is defined as the rate (speed) of change in PSA over time. PSA doubling time is the time it takes the PSA value to increase by 100% (or double). Although these two measures do not appear to be useful in determining who is at risk for prostate cancer, they do appear to be useful in monitoring some individuals with prostate cancer.' "
How is PSA testing used for pretreatment staging of prostate cancer?,"'Once prostate cancer is diagnosed by the presence of cancer cells on prostate biopsy and assigned a cancer grade (''Gleason score''), PSA is used in combination with the grade of the prostate cancer to determine further medical studies needed for cancer staging. Staging (otherwise viewed as the extent of spread of the cancer within the body, or ""Where in the body are the cancer cells?"") determines if the cancer is localized (confined to the organ) or metastatic (has spread to other parts of the body). Staging therefore drives the best management and appropriate treatment for the cancer. As mentioned earlier, serum PSA levels correlate with the risk of prostate cancer extension outside of the prostate including seminal vesicle invasion as well as ''metastasis'' to the pelvic ''lymph nodes''.''The proportion of men with cancer confined to the prostate is about 80% when the PSA level at diagnosis is less than 4.0 ng/mL; about 70% when the PSA level is between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL; and about 50% when the PSA level is greater than 10.0 ng/mL. This is why patients with serum PSA levels of less than 10.0 ng/mL are most likely to respond well to local therapy such as ''prostatectomy'' (surgical removal of the prostate) or external beam ''radiation'' (''radiation therapy''). The need for additional medical tests such as a ''bone scan'' and ''CT scan'' to assess the extent of the prostate cancer will depend on the prostate biopsy results and PSA. Bone scans, used to determine if the prostate cancer has spread to the bones, are recommended if there is high grade prostate cancer present, extensive disease on the biopsy, and PSA > 10-20 ng/mL. CT scan is used to assess for pelvic ''lymph node'' enlargement suggestive of prostate cancer metastases to the lymph nodes and is recommended for individuals with high grade prostate cancer and PSA > 10 ng/mL. Over the past few decades, several predictive tools (otherwise called nomograms) have included the PSA in their parameters to predict posttreatment outcomes. These nomograms include the Partin and Kattan nomograms from Memorial Sloan Kettering. For instance, the Kattan nomogram is an online predictive tool that is available to the public (''https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate'').' "
How is PSA testing used in the management of prostate cancer after treatment?,"'A periodic PSA determination is used to detect disease recurrence after treatment. Serum PSA should decrease and remain at undetectable levels after a radical prostatectomy (complete removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles). An increase in the PSA over time after radical prostatectomy is suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, failure of the PSA to decrease to an undetectable level after radical prostatectomy may indicate residual prostate cancer. Similarly, serum PSA should fall to a low level (nadir) following radiation therapy, high intensity focused ''ultrasound'', and ''cryotherapy'' and remain at or near this level over time.' "
What are the limitations of the PSA test?,"'The level of PSA is a continuous parameter; the higher the value, the higher the probability of having prostate cancer. On the other hand, men may have prostate cancer despite low levels of PSA. In a U.S. ''prevention'' study, 6.6% of the men whose PSA level was less than 0.5 ng/mL had prostate cancer. Thus, although age and ethnicity-based normal reference ranges exist, they have limitations. Furthermore, PSA does not allow one to predict the likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer (meaning cancer that is likely to be aggressive and require treatment) being present, thus subjecting men to potentially unnecessary biopsy and treatment and the morbidity associated with these.' "
What is digital rectal examination (DRE)?,"'Most prostate ''cancers'' are located in the peripheral zone of the prostate and may be detected by DRE. During this examination a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum to feel the prostate for lumps, size, shape, tenderness, and hardness. A suspect DRE is an absolute indication for prostate biopsy, regardless of the PSA level. In about 18% of patients with abnormal DRE, prostate cancer will be detected regardless of the PSA level.' "
What is the PSA screening controversy?,"'The goal of measuring PSA in men with no symptoms of cancer as a screening test for prostate cancer is to reduce the mortality caused by this cancer. Although the advent of prostate ''cancer screening'' is associated with decreased prostate cancer deaths, concerns exist regarding risks of overtreatment and the associated risks of such treatments.''A substantial number of the cancers detected by PSA screening are early stage and low-risk, and these patients will likely never die from this disease. PSA screening, due to its low specificity, does not allow differentiating between low-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. Hence PSA systematic screening is inevitably associated with over-diagnosis and potentially overtreatment. Therefore, not only do these patients not benefit from early detection but they also carry the burden of a cancer diagnosis. In addition, a subset of these patients may suffer the side effects of an unnecessary treatment.''One large European trial (ERSPC) found that PSA screening significantly reduces the mortality (death rate) of prostate cancer but is also associated with a high risk of over-diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2% in the PSA screening group and 4.8% in the control group. Patients in the screening group were 20% less likely to die from prostate cancer compared with the control group. The absolute risk difference between the two groups was 0.71 deaths per 1,000 men. This means that to prevent one death from prostate cancer, 1,410 men would need to be screened with PSA testing and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated.''Another trial (PLCO) conducted in the United States recently concluded that there is no evidence of an improvement in death rate from prostate cancer with annual PSA screening compared with usual medical care. After 13 years of follow-up, the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control groups were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10,000 person-years, respectively, meaning that there was no significant difference between the two groups.''Based on the results of the PLCO trial, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) initially advised against PSA screening in their draft recommendation issued in 2011. More recently, the USPSTF issued a draft of revised recommendations that await finalization. This draft statement reports that the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individualized one. That USPSTF recommended individualized decision-making about ''screening for prostate cancer'' after discussion with the physician so that each man has the opportunity to understand the potential benefits and harms of screening and to incorporate his values and preferences into his decision.''Several urological associations, including the American Urological Association (AUA), Canadian Urological Association (CUA), and European Urological Association (EAU), still value the benefit of PSA screening and recommend physician-patient discussions about screening on an individual basis. The American Urological Association guidelines currently do not recommend routine prostate cancer screening in men between the ages of 40 and 54 years who are felt to be at average risk. For men less than 55 years of age at higher risk (for example, family history of prostate cancer, African-American race), decisions regarding prostate cancer screening should be individualized. The guidelines panel recommends shared decision-making for men 55-69 years of age who are considering prostate cancer screening. Furthermore, the panel notes that to reduce the harms of screening a routine screening interval of two years or more may be preferred over annual screening in those men who shared in clinical decision-making and decided on screening. Lastly, routine PSA screening was not recommended in men 70 years of age and older or any male with less than a 10- to 15-year life expectancy.''The American Cancer Society recommends that asymptomatic men (with no symptoms) who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at 50 years of age. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before 50 years of age.''The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer noted that most panel members favored informed prostate cancer screening, in men with 10 or more year life expectancy, beginning at age 45 years of age. The panel recommended testing at one- to two-year intervals for men with a PSA of > 1.0 ng/ml and every two to four years for those with PSA < 1 ng/mL.' "
How should the PSA test be used for the early detection of prostate cancer?,"'Ultimately, the decision to use PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer should be individualized. Men should be informed of the known risks and the potential benefits of early screening. Not all men are appropriate candidates for screening efforts. For instance, screening in men with less than a 10-year life expectancy, either due to age or other illness, is discouraged as there will be most likely no benefit for them.''If prostate cancer is detected on prostate biopsy, all treatment options should be discussed. The benefits and risks of the many treatment options should be reviewed and discussed with men found to have prostate cancer. The AUA recommends that this discussion include active surveillance in men with low-risk prostate cancer. The goal of active surveillance is to allow men to maintain their quality of life when the disease is slow-growing or inactive but still allow them to be cured of prostate cancer when the disease appears to become more aggressive or is fast-growing. Other novel biomarkers, such as PCA3 (see below), may assist the clinician in these decisions.' "
What is PCA3?,"'A newly discovered biomarker is known as PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3). PCA3 may help to discriminate between cancer-related versus nonspecific PSA elevations. PCA3 was initially identified by comparing prostate cancer tissue with nonmalignant normal prostatic tissue. PCA3 is a type of genetic material known as noncoding RNA that is found at high levels in prostate cancerous tissue. But unlike PSA, it is only present at a low level in benign prostatic tissue. Hence PCA3 can be considered a prostate cancer specific marker.''While PSA is detected in the blood, PCA3 is measured in the urine obtained after prostatic ''massage''. The main advantages of PCA3 over PSA testing are its higher sensitivity and specificity. In particular, PCA3 may be useful for identifying prostate cancer in men who initially had negative biopsies despite an elevated PSA. This is why the use of a PCA3 test may help reduce the number of potentially unnecessary biopsies generated by nonspecific positive PSA screening tests. PCA3 scores that are over 35 are considered higher risk and would then warrant investigation by a prostate biopsy. The 2013 AUA guidelines on early detection of prostate cancer recognize that PCA3 plays a role as a secondary screening test (after PSA screening) and can be used as an adjunct for informing decisions about the need for biopsy or repeat biopsy.' "
What is the 4K biomarker?,"'The ''4kscore test'' measures free and total PSA, human kallikrein 2 (hk2), and intact PSA and considers age, digital rectal exam results, and prior biopsy status. The test result reports the percent likelihood of finding high-grade prostate cancer on a prostate biopsy result. This test is not approved by the FDA, rather it is regulated as a laboratory-developed test. No cutoff threshold has been established for this test. Currently, the NCCN recommendations are that this test can be considered in patients prior to biopsy and for those with a prior negative prostate biopsy who are thought to be at higher risk for a high grade prostate cancer.' "
Facts you should know about primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),"'Primary sclerosing cholangitis'' describes a disease process in which the bile ducts in the ''liver'' become inflamed, narrow and prevent bile from flowing properly.''The liver produces bile to help digest food in the intestine. Bile from liver cells is transported through the bile ducts in the biliary tree, where it then enters the gallbladder. When food enters the small intestine, bile helps break down fat into fatty acids so that they can be absorbed and used by the body. This also helps in the absorption of fat soluble ''vitamins'' (A, D, E & K).''As the bile ducts become inflamed and narrow, bile cannot easily flow and begins to back up. This increases the pressure within the liver causing liver cells to become inflamed. Over time, this inflammation decreases blood flow within the liver, increasing the pressure in the portal vein. This eventually causes ''portal hypertension'', a backup in the portal system causing veins that line the ''esophagus'', stomach, and intestine to swell (varices) and the spleen to swell (''splenomegaly'').''As the disease progress, liver cells die and are replace by ''scar tissue''. This is called ''cirrhosis'' and is associated with liver failure.'  "
What causes primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The cause of ''PSC'' is unknown but it has an association with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease, especially ''ulcerative colitis'"". It is thought that there may be an autoimmune component to the disease, where the body's immune system attacks the bile ducts in the liver and causes them to become, inflamed and narrowed."" "
What are the risk factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The cause of PSC is unknown but it may be an autoimmune disease. ''PSC is more often seen in men in the 20-30 age range. There is an association with ''inflammatory bowel'', disease, most often with ''ulcerative colitis'' and less commonly with '""Crohn's Disease""'. ''People with PSC who do not have ''inflammatory bowel disease'', are more likely to be female and older.' "
What are primary sclerosing cholangitis symptoms and signs?,"'In its early stages, PSC is asymptomatic (there are no symptoms). It is only when the person develops ''cholestasis'' because of the inability of bile to drain from the liver, do symptoms occur. These early symptoms include ''itching'' and ''fatigue''. As the ''bilirubin'' levels in the blood become elevated, ''jaundice'' or a yellowish tinge to the skin, may occur. Since there may be liver inflammation, the person may complain of ''pain'' beneath the ribs in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.''The inability of the bile ducts to adequately drain reduces the flow of bile and there can be sludge formation in the bile ducts leading to the risk of infection. This may cause ''fever'' and increased ''pain''.''Because PSC is a progressive disease, symptoms may come and go over several months and years after the diagnosis is made.''As the disease progresses, ''cirrhosis'' may occur leading to decreased ''liver function'' and its associated signs and symptoms. These include bleeding from the esophagus and stomach due to varices, ''ascites'' (fluid collection in the abdomen) because of poor protein production by the liver, ''easy bruising'' because of decreased platelets in the blood as because they are trapped in the ''enlarged spleen'', and ''confusion'' due to ''hepatic encephalopathy'' because the liver cannot clear waste products of metabolism.'  "
How do doctors make a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'PSC may remain silent for several years before symptoms arise. In patients with ''inflammatory bowel disease'', the health care professional should have a high suspicion of the diagnosis because of the relationship between PSC and ''ulcerative colitis''.''Depending upon how far the disease has progressed and the effect on liver function, physical examination may reveal an ''enlarged liver'', tenderness in the right upper quadrant beneath the ribs, and an ''enlarged spleen''. The skin may be jaundiced or yellow and there can be evidence of scratching due to intense skin ''itching''. In cirrhosis with end stage ''liver disease'', there may be ''bruising'' of the skin, a swollen abdomen due to ''ascites'' or fluid caused by decreased protein production and decreased blood flow through the scarred liver, gastrointestinal bleeding, and mental confusion because of elevated ammonia levels in the bloodstream.''Blood tests are helpful in assessing the liver and potential blockages within the bile ducts. These may include a ''complete blood count'', INR/PTT (that measures blood clotting and the ability of the liver to produce clotting factors), liver function studies including AST, and ALT to assess liver inflammation, ''alkaline phosphatase'' and bilirubin which measure the degree of bile blockage.''Imaging tests may include ''ultrasound'' to look at the liver structure and magnetic resonance cholangiogram, an ''MRI'' of the abdomen that can assess the bile duct structure of the liver.''If the diagnosis based on laboratory tests and imaging is still in doubt, a biopsy may be performed. A ''gastroenterologist'' or interventional radiologist will place a long, fine needle through the skin into the liver to obtain a piece of tissue. This is analyzed under a microscope by a pathologist to make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The treatment of PSC is supportive, monitoring the progression of the disease and treating symptoms and complications as they arise. The only ""cure"" is liver transplantation, which may be an option when the disease progresses to cirrhosis and the liver function is affected.''When some of the larger bile ducts become blocked, there is potential to open them with ''ERCP'' (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and balloon dilatation and/or ''stent'' placement. A gastroenterologist passes a thin video endoscope into the mouth and threads it through the stomach into the duodenum and using a catheter, enters the bile ducts. Should a narrow duct or stricture be found, a balloon can be used to dilate the narrowing and a stent can be placed to keep the duct open. This is similar to how a cardiologist opens a blocked blood vessel in the ''heart''In some cases, surgery may be an option to remove some scarred and blocked bile ducts and having more normal bile ducts reconnected bypassing scarred areas of the bile ducts.' "
Medications for primary sclerosing cholangitis,"'There is no medication that is approved to treat primary sclerosing cholangitis, but medications may be used to control symptoms. ''Ursodiol'' (Actigal), also known as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may improve liver function tests but has not been shown to increase survival and may be associated with complications like bleeding. While it is thought that PSC may be an autoimmune disease, immunosuppressive medications have not been shown to work.''Itching is often treated with ''antihistamines'' including ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax) and ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''). ''Cholestyramine'' (''Questran'', ''Questran Light''), a medication that helps bind bile salts may also be helpful.''Should infection occur, treatment may require antibiotics.''As the disease progresses, the damaged liver may not be able to help with the absorption of ''vitamins'' and nutrients from the intestine. Vitamins and other dietary and calorie ''supplements'' may be required to treat malnutrition.'  "
Liver transplant,"'Liver transplant'' is the only ""cure"" for primary sclerosing cholangitis, but it is only recommended for patients whose disease has progressed to liver failure. The three-year U.S. survival rate for all transplants is 81%. The five-year survival rate is about 75%, according to the data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.''The goal of liver transplantation is to restore liver function. Though unlikely, it is possible for PSC to recur in the new liver.' "
What complications are associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'PSC is a progressive disease, damaging the bile ducts and reducing the bile flow, ultimately leading to portal ''hypertension'', cirrhosis, and liver failure.''Some ''cancers'' are associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis including ''gallbladder cancer'', hepatocellular ''cancer'' (''cancer of the liver'' cells) and ''cholangiocarcinoma'' (''cancer'' of the bile ducts). The combination of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and PSC increases the risk of developing cancers of the colon and rectum'  "
Is it possible to prevent primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'The specific cause of PSC is still unknown and therefore it seems not to be preventable. It is appropriate for patients with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease (especially ulcerative ''colitis'') and their health care professional to be aware of the relationship with primary sclerosing cholangitis, in case symptoms suggestive of the disease arise. However, PSC is seen in only 3% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with primary sclerosing cholangitis?,"'Aside from liver transplantation, there are no effective treatments for PSC. In the US, studies suggest that life expectancy ranges from 9 to 18 years if the patient does not undergo liver transplantation. Using different population study models, researchers in the Netherlands concluded that life expectancy may be longer than 21 years from the time when the diagnosis is made.''The prognosis and life expectance is poorer in older patients, those who have an enlarged liver and spleen, and in patients who are persistently jaundiced with elevated bilirubin levels in their bloodstream.' "
Facts you should know about pseudogout, Pseudogout is caused by crystals in a joint. Pseudogout causes arthritis (joint inflammation). Pseudogout can cause calcification of cartilage. The arthritis of pseudogout is diagnosed by detecting typical crystals in joint fluid. Treatment of pseudogout is directed at the inflammation. Pseudogout can be associated with other illnesses.
What is pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is a type of inflammation of joints (arthritis) that is caused by deposits of crystals, called calcium pyrophosphate, in and around the joints. Pseudogout literally means ""false ''gout''."" It derives its name from its similarity to ''gout''.''Pseudogout has many similarities to true ''gout'', which also can cause arthritis. However, the crystal that incites the inflammation of ''gout'' is monosodium urate. The crystals that cause pseudogout and ''gout'' each have distinct appearances when joint fluid containing them is viewed under a microscope. This makes it possible to precisely identify the cause of the joint inflammation when joint fluid is available.''Pseudogout has been reported to occasionally coexist with gout. This means that the two types of crystals can sometimes be found in the same joint fluid. Researchers have also noted that the cartilage of patients who had both forms of crystals in their joint fluid was often visibly calcified, as seen on X-ray images.' "
What are causes of pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is primarily caused by the precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals developing within a joint space. Pseudogout has sometimes been referred to as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD.''Pseudogout is clearly related to ''aging'' as it is more common in the elderly and is associated with ''degenerative arthritis''. Acute attacks of the arthritis of pseudogout can be caused by ''dehydration''. This is particularly common in hospitalized patients and those recovering from operations, especially when associated with ''dehydration''. Pseudogout can also be caused by the hormonal effects on calcium metabolism from ''hyperparathyroidism''.'  "
What are risk factors for pseudogout?,"'Older age and a history of joint ''trauma'' (either due to an accident or surgery) are risk factors for pseudogout.''Additional risk factors for pseudogout include hyperparathyroidism, ''amyloidosis'', gout, and degenerative arthritis (''osteoarthritis'').' "
What are pseudogout symptoms and signs?,"'Pseudogout can result in arthritis of a number of joints. The most common joint affected is the knee, but it can also involve the wrists, shoulders, hips, and/or ankles. Pseudogout usually affects only one or a few joints at a time. The ""attacks"" of joint inflammation, characterized by acute ''joint swelling'', warmth, ''stiffness'', and ''pain'', may last for days to weeks and can resolve spontaneously. The inflammation leads to loss of range of motion and function of the involved joint.'  "
How does a doctor diagnose pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is suggested when abnormal calcifications are seen in the cartilage of joints on ''X-rays''. These calcifications are referred to as chondrocalcinosis and very suggestive of a diagnosis of pseudogout when there is also inflammation of the involved joint.''The diagnosis of pseudogout is ultimately made when fluid from a joint is extracted and is examined under a special microscope called a polarizing microscope. With this microscope, the calcium pyrophosphate crystals are clearly identified by their characteristic shape and color (medically term weakly positively birefringent rhomboid crystals).''The arthritis of pseudogout is common in older adults, particularly in the context of dehydration such as occurs with hospitalization or surgery.' "
What are treatments for pseudogout?,"'The treatment of pseudogout is directed toward stopping the inflammation in the joints. Local ice applications and resting can help. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') and others are often first drugs of choice.''Removing fluid containing the crystals from the joint can reduce ''pain'' and help the inflammation to diminish more quickly. Cortisone injected into an inflamed joint will also help decrease the inflammation. ''Colchicine'' (''Colcrys'') is a medication used to decrease inflammation in patients with gout and may also be helpful in pseudogout. ''Corticosteroids'"" taken as a pill can help if the patient can't tolerate colchicine or NSAIDs.""'Long-term ''prevention'' of recurrent pseudogout is often best achieved with small daily doses of colchicine and optimal hydration.'  "
What other conditions can accompany pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout can occur along with ''aging'', be ''inherited'', or be associated with ''hemophilia'', ''hemochromatosis'', ochronosis, amyloidosis, or hormonal disorders (such as hyperparathyroidism and ''hypothyroidism''). These illnesses, as well as others, are considered in the initial evaluation of a patient with pseudogout.' "
"Are there special circumstances that can promote attacks of
 pseudogout?",'Arthritis attacks of pseudogout can be precipitated by dehydration and not infrequently follow surgical procedures in elderly patients.' 
What are complications of pseudogout?,'Pseudogout can be complicated by difficulty in ''walking'' and injury to the cartilage and bone of affected joints.' 
What is the prognosis of pseudogout?,"'The outlook of pseudogout is generally very good. Aggressive treatment of the inflammation can lead to complete resolution of the inflammation, pain, tenderness, and loss of joint function. While this can last for weeks, the inflammation of resolves within days with proper treatment.''Recurrent attacks of pseudogout and chronic joint inflammation can lead to injury to the affected cartilage and bone.' "
Is it possible to prevent pseudogout?,'Patients with known pseudogout should stay well hydrated before and after operations to minimize the risk of attacks of pseudogout. Resting the joints may help during a flare-up.'  
What specialists treat pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is treated by general practitioners, family practitioners, internists, ''rheumatologists'', and orthopedists.' "
Where can people get more information about pseudogout?,'People can get more information about pseudogout from the Arthritis Foundation.' 
What is pseudotumor cerebri?,"'Pseudotumor cerebri'' literally means ""false ''brain tumor''."" It is likely due to high pressure within the skull caused by the buildup or poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The disorder is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 50.  ' "
What are the symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri?,"'Symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include symptoms that closely mimic large ''brain tumors'':'   headache,  nausea,  vomiting, and  pulsating sounds within the head. "
How is pseudotumor cerebri treated?,"   Obesity, other treatable diseases, and some medications can cause raised intracranial pressure and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri.  A thorough medical history and physical examination is needed to evaluate these factors.  If a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri is confirmed, close, repeated ophthalmologic exams are required to monitor any changes in vision.  Drugs may be used to reduce fluid buildup and to relieve pressure.  Weight loss and cessation of certain drugs (including oral contraceptives, tetracycline, and a variety of steroids) may lead to improvement.  Surgery may be needed to remove pressure on the optic nerve. Therapeutic shunting, which involves surgically inserting a tube to drain CSF from the lower spine into the abdominal cavity, may be needed to remove excess CSF and relieve CSF pressure. "
What is the prognosis for patient's with pseudotumor cerebri?,"'The disorder may cause progressive, permanent visual loss in some patients. In some cases, pseudotumor cerebri recurs.' "

What is pseudoxanthoma elasticum?,"'The connective tissues are the structural portions of the body that essentially hold the body cells together. These tissues form a framework or matrix for the body, and are composed of two major structural molecules, collagen and elastin. There are many different collagen protein types which vary in abundance depending on body area. Elastin is another protein which has the capability of stretching and returning to original length like a spring.''Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare disorder of degeneration of the elastic fibers with tiny areas of calcification in the skin, back of the eyes (retinae), and blood vessels. Interestingly, while elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues which attach bone to bone), the ligaments are not apparently affected by PXE. ' "
How is pseudoxanthoma elasticum inherited?,"'PXE is inherited from the parents, either as an autosomal recessive or as an autosomal dominant trait. Identification of the gene responsible for PXE can facilitate the determination of the exact patterns of inheritance. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an inherited disorder of elastin.' "
What are symptoms of pseudoxanthoma elasticum?,"'PXE typically causes yellow-white small raised areas in the skin folds, often appearing in the second or third decades of life. These skin abnormalities frequently appear on the neck, armpits, and other areas that bend a great deal (referred to as flexure areas). The face is not affected by PXE. The doctor can often see abnormalities in the back of the eye (retinae) called angioid streaks, which are tiny breaks in the elastin-filled tissue there. These eye abnormalities can lead to ''blindness''.''Other areas that can be affected in PXE include the ''heart'' which can be affected by ''atherosclerosis'' and ''mitral valve prolapse''. Small blood vessels are abnormally fragile in patients with PXE because the blood vessel walls contain elastin and are weakened. This can lead to abnormal bleeding in such areas as the bowel and, very rarely, the uterus. Impairment of circulation to the legs can lead to pains in the legs while ''walking'' (''claudication'').' "
"What is the treatment for patients with pseudoxanthoma
elasticum?","'There is no cure for PXE. Treatment of patients with PXE involves monitoring organ function and consequences of the effects of the weakened elastin fibers in the body as well as measures to prevent injury and promote overall health.''For further information about Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, please visit the following site: ''PXE International: Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum''.' "
What is psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is a noncontagious, chronic skin disease that produces plaques of thickened, scaly skin. The dry flakes of silvery-white skin scales result from the excessively rapid proliferation of skin cells. Psoriasis is fundamentally a defective inflammatory response. The proliferation of skin cells is triggered by inflammatory chemicals produced by specialized white blood cells called T-cells. Psoriasis commonly affects the skin of the elbows, knees, and scalp.''The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild with limited involvement of small areas of skin to ''severe psoriasis'' with large, thick plaques to red inflamed skin affecting the entire body surface.''Psoriasis is considered an incurable, long-term (chronic) inflammatory skin condition. It has a variable course, periodically improving and worsening. It is not unusual for psoriasis to spontaneously clear for years and stay in remission. Many people note a worsening of their symptoms in the colder winter months.''Psoriasis affects all races and both sexes. Although psoriasis can be seen in people of any age, from ''babies'' to seniors, most commonly patients are first diagnosed in their early adult years. The self-esteem and quality of life of patients with psoriasis is often diminished because of the appearance of their skin. Recently, it has become clear that people with psoriasis are more likely to have ''diabetes'', high blood ''lipids'', ''cardiovascular disease'', and a variety of other inflammatory diseases. This may reflect an inability to control inflammation. Caring for psoriasis takes medical teamwork.' "
What are psoriasis causes and risk factors?,"'The exact cause remains unknown. A combination of elements, including genetic predisposition and environmental factors, are involved. It is common for psoriasis to be found in members of the same family. Defects in the immune system and the control of inflammation are thought to play major roles. Certain medications like ''beta-blockers'' have been linked to psoriasis. Despite research over the past 30 years, the ""master switch"" that turns on psoriasis is still a mystery.' "
What are the different types of psoriasis?,"'There are several different forms of psoriasis, including plaque psoriasis or ''psoriasis vulgaris'' (common type), ''guttate psoriasis'' (small, drop-like spots), ''inverse psoriasis'' (in the folds like of the underarms, navel, groin, and buttocks), and ''pustular psoriasis'' (small pus-filled yellowish ''blisters''). When the palms and the soles are involved, this is known as palmoplantar psoriasis. In ''erythrodermic psoriasis'', the entire skin surface is involved with the disease. Patients with this form of psoriasis often feel ''cold'' and may develop ''congestive heart failure'' if they have a preexisting ''heart'' problem. Nail psoriasis produces yellow pitted nails that can be confused with ''nail fungus''. ''Scalp psoriasis'' can be severe enough to produce localized ''hair loss'', plenty of ''dandruff'', and severe ''itching''.' "
What are psoriasis symptoms and signs? What does psoriasis look like?,"'Plaque psoriasis signs and symptoms appear as red or pink small scaly ''bumps'' that merge into plaques of raised skin. Plaque psoriasis classically affects skin over the elbows, knees, and scalp and is often ''itchy''. Although any area may be involved, plaque psoriasis tends to be more common at sites of friction, scratching, or ''abrasion''. Sometimes pulling off one of these small dry white flakes of skin causes a tiny blood spot on the skin. This is a special diagnostic sign in psoriasis called the Auspitz sign.''Fingernails and toenails often exhibit small pits (pinpoint depressions) and/or larger yellowish-brown separations of the nail from the nail bed at the fingertip called distal ''onycholysis''. Nail psoriasis may be confused with and incorrectly diagnosed as a ''fungal nail infection''.''Guttate ''psoriasis symptoms'' and signs include bumps or small plaques (½ inch or less) of red itchy, scaling skin that may appear explosively, affecting large parts of the skin surface simultaneously, after a ''sore throat''.''In inverse psoriasis, genital lesions, especially in the groin and on the head of the penis, are common. Psoriasis in moist areas like the navel or the area between the buttocks (intergluteal folds) may look like flat red plaques without much scaling. This may be confused with other ''skin conditions'' like ''fungal infections'', yeast infections, ''allergic'' ''rashes'', or ''bacterial infections''.''Symptoms and signs of pustular psoriasis include at rapid onset of groups of small bumps filled with pus on the torso. Patients are often systemically ill and may have a ''fever''.''Erythrodermic psoriasis appears as extensive areas of red skin often involving the entire skin surface. Patients may often feel chilled.''Scalp psoriasis may look like severe ''dandruff'' with dry flakes and red areas of skin. It can be difficult to differentiate between scalp psoriasis and ''seborrheic dermatitis'' when only the scalp is involved. However, the treatment is often very similar for both conditions.'  "
Can psoriasis affect my joints?,"'Yes, psoriasis is associated with inflamed joints in about one-third of those affected. In fact, sometimes ''joint pains'' may be the only sign of the disorder, with completely clear skin. The joint disease associated with psoriasis is referred to as ''psoriatic arthritis''. Patients may have inflammation of any joints (''arthritis''), although the joints of the hands, knees, and ankles tend to be most commonly affected. ''Psoriatic arthritis'' is an inflammatory, destructive form of arthritis and needs to be treated with medications in order to stop the disease progression.''The average age for onset of ''psoriatic arthritis'' is 30-40 years of age. Usually, the skin symptoms and signs precede the onset of the arthritis.' "
Can psoriasis affect only my nails?,"'Yes, psoriasis may involve solely the nails in a limited number of patients. Usually, the nail signs accompany the skin and arthritis symptoms and signs. Nail psoriasis is typically very difficult to treat. Treatment options are somewhat limited and include potent topical steroids applied at the nail-base cuticle, injection of steroids at the nail-base cuticle, and oral or systemic medications as described below for the treatment of psoriasis.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose psoriasis?,"'The diagnosis of psoriasis is typically made by obtaining information from the physical examination of the skin, medical history, and relevant family health history.''Sometimes lab tests, including a microscopic examination of tissue obtained from a surgical ''skin biopsy'', may be necessary.' "
Eczema vs. psoriasis,"'Occasionally, it can be difficult to differentiate eczematous ''dermatitis'' from psoriasis. This is when a biopsy can be quite valuable to distinguish between the two conditions. Of note, both eczematous dermatitis and psoriasis often respond to similar treatments. Certain types of eczematous dermatitis can be cured, which is not the case for psoriasis.' "
Is psoriasis contagious?,"'No. A person cannot catch it from someone else, and one cannot pass it to anyone else by skin-to-skin contact. Directly touching someone with psoriasis every day will never transmit the condition.' "
How many people have psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is a fairly common skin condition and is estimated to affect approximately 1%-3% of the U.S. population. It currently affects roughly 7.5 million to 8.5 million people in the U.S. It is seen worldwide in about 125 million people. Interestingly, African Americans have about half the rate of psoriasis as Caucasians.' "
Is there a cure for psoriasis?,"'No, psoriasis is not currently curable. However, it can go into remission, producing an entirely normal skin surface. Ongoing research is actively making progress on finding better treatments and a possible cure in the future.' "
Is psoriasis hereditary?,"'Although psoriasis is not contagious from person to person, there is a known hereditary tendency. Therefore, family history is very helpful in making the diagnosis.' "
What health care specialists treat psoriasis?,"'Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis, and ''rheumatologists'' specialize in the treatment of joint disorders and psoriatic arthritis. Many kinds of doctors may treat psoriasis, including dermatologists, family physicians, internal medicine physicians, rheumatologists, and other medical doctors. Some patients have also seen other allied health professionals such as acupuncturists, holistic practitioners, chiropractors, and nutritionists.''The American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation are excellent sources to help find doctors who specialize in this disease. Not all dermatologists and rheumatologists treat psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation has one of the most up-to-date databases of current psoriasis specialists.''It is now apparent that patients with psoriasis are prone to a variety of other disease conditions, so-called comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease, ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''hyperlipidemia'', ''liver'' problems, and arthritis are more common in patients with psoriasis. It is very important for all patients with psoriasis to be carefully monitored by their primary care providers for these associated illnesses. The ''joint inflammation'' of psoriatic arthritis and its complications are frequently managed by rheumatologists.' "
What are psoriasis treatment options?,"'There are many effective psoriasis treatment choices. The best treatment is individually determined by the treating doctor and depends, in part, on the type of disease, the severity, and amount of skin involved and the type of insurance coverage.''For mild disease that involves only small areas of the body (less than 10% of the total skin surface), topical treatments (skin applied), such as creams, lotions, and sprays, may be very effective and safe to use. Occasionally, a small local injection of steroids directly into a tough or resistant isolated psoriatic plaque may be helpful.''For moderate to severe psoriasis that involves much larger areas of the body (>10% or more of the total skin surface), topical products may not be effective or practical to apply. This may require ultraviolet light treatments or systemic (total body treatments such as pills or injections) medicines. Internal medications usually have greater risks. Because topical therapy has no effect on psoriatic arthritis, systemic medications are generally required to stop the progression to permanent joint destruction.''It is important to keep in mind that as with any medical condition, all medicines carry possible side effects. No medication is 100% effective for everyone, and no medication is 100% safe. The decision to use any medication requires thorough consideration and discussion with your health care provider. The risks and potential benefit of medications have to be considered for each type of psoriasis and the individual. Of two patients with precisely the same amount of disease, one may tolerate it with very little treatment, while the other may become incapacitated and require treatment internally.''A proposal to minimize the toxicity of some of these medicines has been commonly called ""rotational"" therapy. The idea is to change the anti-psoriasis drugs every six to 24 months in order to minimize the toxicity of one medication. Depending on the medications selected, this proposal can be an option. An exception to this proposal is the use of the newer biologic medications as described below. An individual who has been using strong topical steroids over large areas of their body for prolonged periods may benefit from stopping the steroids for a while and rotating onto a different therapy.'  "
"What creams, lotions, and home remedies are available for psoriasis?","'Topical (skin applied) treatments include ''topical corticosteroids'', ''vitamin D'' analogue creams like calcipotriene (Calcitrene, ''Dovonex'', ''Sorilux''), topical retinoids (''tazarotene'' [''Tazorac'']), moisturizers, topical immunomodulators (''tacrolimus'' and ''pimecrolimus''), coal tar, anthralin, and others.'   Topical corticosteroids (steroids, such as hydrocortisone) are very useful and often the first-line treatment for limited or small areas of psoriasis. These come in many preparations, including sprays, liquid, creams, gels, ointments, and foams. Steroids come in many different strengths, including stronger ones that are used for elbows, knees, and tougher skin areas and milder ones for areas like the face, underarms, and groin. These are usually applied once or twice a day to affected skin areas. Strong steroid preparations should be limited in use. Overuse or prolonged use may cause problems, including potential permanent skin thinning and damage called atrophy. Calcipotriene cream is useful in psoriasis because of its effect on calcium metabolism. The advantage of calcitriol is that it is not known to thin the skin like topical steroids. There is a newer combination preparation of calcipotriene and a topical steroid called Taclonex. Not all patients may respond to calcipotriene. Prolonged use of these types of medications on more than 20% of the skin surface can produce an abnormal rise in body calcium levels. Moisturizers, especially with therapeutic concentrations of salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, and glycolic acid may be helpful in psoriasis. These moisturizers are available as prescription and nonprescription forms. These help reduce the scales that impede the movement of topical medications into the deeper layers of the skin. Some available preparations include salicylic acid (Salex) and lactic acid (AmLactin, Lac-Hydrin). These may be used one to three times a day on the body. Other bland moisturizers, including Vaseline and Crisco vegetable shortening, may also be helpful in at least reducing the dry appearance of psoriasis. Immunomodulators (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) have also been used with some limited success in mild psoriasis. These have the advantage of not causing skin thinning. They may have other potential side effects, including skin infections and possible malignancies (cancers). The exact association of these immunomodulator creams and cancer is controversial. Bath salts or bathing in high-salt-concentration waters like the Dead Sea in the Middle East along with careful exposure to sunlight can be beneficial to psoriasis patients. Coal tar is available in multiple preparations, including shampoos, bath solutions, and creams. Coal tar may help reduce the appearance and decrease the flakes in psoriasis. The odor, staining, and overall messiness with coal tar may make it less desirable than other therapies. A major advantage with tar is lack of skin thinning. Anthralin is available for topical use as a cream, ointment, or paste. The stinging, possible irritation, and skin discoloration may make this less acceptable to use. Anthralin may be applied for 10-30 minutes to psoriatic skin."
Are psoriasis shampoos available?,"'Coal tar shampoos are very useful in controlling ''psoriasis of the scalp''. Using the shampoo daily can be very beneficial adjunctive therapy. There are a variety of ''over-the-counter'' shampoos available without a prescription. There is no evidence that one shampoo is superior to another. Generally, the selection of a tar shampoo is simply a matter of personal preference.' "
What oral medications are available for psoriasis?,"'Oral medications include ''methotrexate'' (''Trexall''), ''acitretin'' (''Soriatane''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral''), ''apremilast'' (''Otezla''), and others. Oral ''prednisone'' (''corticosteroid'') is generally not used in psoriasis and may cause a disease flare-up if discontinued.' Acitretin (Soriatane) is an oral drug used for certain types of psoriasis. It is not effective in all types of the disease. It may be used in males and females who are not pregnant and not planning to become pregnant for at least three years. The major side effects include dryness of skin and eyes and temporarily elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (fatty substance) in the blood. Blood tests are generally required before starting this therapy and are needed periodically to monitor triglyceride levels. Patients should not become pregnant while on this drug and usually avoid becoming pregnant for at least three years after stopping this medication. Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive drug used for other medical uses, including organ transplantation. It may be used for severe, difficult-to-treat cases of widespread psoriasis. Improvement and results may be very rapid in onset. It may be hard to get someone off of cyclosporine without flaring their psoriasis. Because of the potential cumulative toxicity, cyclosporine should not be used for more than one to two years for most psoriasis patients. Major possible side effects include kidney and blood-pressure problems. Methotrexate is a common drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, and it has been used effectively for many years in psoriasis. It is usually given in small weekly doses (5 mg-25 mg), either orally or by injection. Blood tests are required before and during therapy. The drug may cause liver and lung damage. Close physician monitoring and monthly to quarterly visits and labs are generally required. FDA has approved a new oral drug, apremilast (Otezla), to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with an entirely novel mode of action (inhibition of an enzyme, phosphodiesterase 4) and does not require intensive laboratory monitoring."
What injections or infusions are available for psoriasis?,"'Recently, a new group of drugs called ''biologics'' have become available to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. They are produced by living cells cultures in an industrial setting. They are all proteins and therefore must be administered through the skin because they would otherwise be degraded during ''digestion''. All biologics work by suppressing certain specific portions of the immune inflammatory response that are overactive in psoriasis. A convenient method of categorizing these drugs is on the basis of their site of action:'""Drug choice can be complicated, and your physician will help in selecting the best option. In some patients, it may be possible to predict drug efficacy on the basis of a prospective patient's genetics. It appears that the presence of the HLA-Cw6 gene is correlated with a beneficial response to ustekinumab.""'Newer drugs are in development and no doubt will be available in the near future. As this class of drugs is fairly new, ongoing monitoring and adverse effect reporting continues and long-term safety continues to be monitored. Biologics are all comparatively expensive especially in view of the fact they none of them are curative. Recently, the FDA has attempted to address this problem by permitting the use of ""biosimilar"" drugs. These drugs are structurally identical to a specific ''biologic drug'' and are presumed to produce identical therapeutic responses in human beings to the original, but are produced using different methodology. Biosimilars ought to be available at some fraction of the cost of the original. If this will be an effective approach remains to be seen. The only biosimilar available currently is infliximab (''Inflectra''). Two other biosimilar drugs have been accepted by the FDA, an etanercept equivalent (Erelzi) and an adalimumab equivalent (Amjevita) -- but currently, neither are available.'""Some biologics are to be administered by self-injections for home use while others are given by intravenous infusions in the doctor's office. Biologics have some screening requirements such as a ""'tuberculosis'' screening test (''TB'' skin test or PPD test) and other labs prior to starting therapy. As with any drug, side effects are possible with all biologic drugs. Common potential side effects include mild local injection-site reactions (redness and tenderness). There is concern of serious infections and potential ''malignancy'' with nearly all biologic drugs. Precautions include patients with known or suspected ''hepatitis B'' infection, active ''tuberculosis'', and possibly ''HIV/AIDS''. As a general consideration, these drugs may not be an ideal choice for patients with a history of ''cancer'' and patients actively undergoing ''cancer'' therapy. In particular, there may be an increased association of ''lymphoma'' in patients taking a biologic.''Biologics are expensive medications ranging in price from several to tens of thousands of dollars per year per person. Their use may be limited by availability, cost, and insurance approval. Not all insurance drug plans fully cover these drugs for all conditions. Patients need to check with their insurance and may require a prior authorization request for coverage approval. Some of the biologic manufacturers have patient-assistance programs to help with financial issues. Therefore, choice of the right medication for your condition depends on many factors, not all of them medical. Additionally, convenience of receiving the medication and lifestyle affect the choice of the right biologic medication.' Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-alpha) inhibitors (certolizumab pegol [Cimzia], etanercept [Enbrel], adalimumab [Humira], infliximab [Remicade], golimumab [Simponi]) Interleukin 12 and 23 (IL-12/23) inhibitor (ustekinumab [Stelara]) Interleukin 17 (IL-17) inhibitors (secukinumab [Cosentyx], brodalumab [Siliq], ixekizumab [Taltz]) Interleukin 23 (IL-23) inhibitor (guselkumab [Tremfya]) T cell inhibitor abatacept (Orencia)"
Is there an anti-psoriasis diet?,"'Most patients with psoriasis seem to be ''overweight''. Since there is a predisposition for those patients to develop cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it is suggested strongly that they try to maintain a normal body weight. Although evidence is sparse, it has been suggested that slender patients are more likely to respond to treatment.''Although dietary studies are notoriously difficult to perform and interpret, it seems likely that an anti-inflammatory\xa0''diet'' whose fat content is composed of polyunsaturated oils like olive oil and ''fish oil'' is beneficial for psoriasis. The so-called ''Mediterranean diet'' is an example.'  "
What about light therapy for psoriasis?,"'Light therapy is also called phototherapy. There are several types of medical light therapies that include ''PUVA'"" (an acronym for psoralen + UVA), UVB, and narrow-band UVB. These artificial light sources have been used for decades and generally are available in only certain physician's offices. There are a few companies who may sell light boxes or light bulbs for prescribed home light therapy.""'Natural sunlight is also used to treat psoriasis. Daily short, controlled exposures to natural sunlight may help or clear psoriasis in some patients. Skin unaffected by psoriasis and sensitive areas such as the face and hands may need to be protected during sun exposure.''There are also multiple newer light sources like lasers and ''photodynamic therapy'' (use of a light activating medication and a special light source) that have been used to treat psoriasis.'""PUVA is a special treatment using a photosensitizing drug and timed artificial-light exposure composed of wavelengths of ultraviolet light in the UVA spectrum. The photosensitizing drug in PUVA is called psoralen. Both the psoralen and the UVA light must be administered within one hour of each other for a response to occur. These treatments are usually given in a physician's office two to three times per week. Several weeks of PUVA is usually required before seeing significant results. The light exposure time is gradually increased during each subsequent treatment. Psoralens may be given orally as a pill or topically as a bath or lotion. After a short incubation period, the skin is exposed to a special wavelength of ultraviolet light called UVA. Patients using PUVA are generally sun sensitive and must avoid sun exposure for a period of time after PUVA. Common side effects with PUVA include burning, ""'aging'' of the skin, increased brown spots called ''lentigines'', and an increased risk of ''skin cancer'', including ''melanoma''. The relative increase in ''skin cancer'' risk with PUVA treatment is controversial. PUVA treatments need to be closely monitored by a physician and discontinued when a maximum number of treatments have been reached.''Narrow-band UVB phototherapy is an artificial light treatment using very limited wavelengths of light. It is frequently given daily or two to three times per week. UVB is also a component of natural sunlight. UVB dosage is based on time and exposure is gradually increased as tolerated. Potential side effects with UVB include skin burning, premature ''aging'', and possible increased risk of ''skin cancer''. The relative increase in ''skin cancer'' risk with UVB treatment needs further study but is probably less than PUVA or traditional UVB.''Sometimes UVB is combined with other treatments such as tar application. Goeckerman is a special psoriasis therapy using this combination. Some centers have used this therapy in a ""day care"" type of setting where patients are in the psoriasis treatment clinic all day for several weeks and go home each night.''Recently, a laser (excimer laser XTRAC) has been developed that generates ultraviolet light in the same range as narrow-band ultraviolet light. This light can be beneficial for psoriasis localized to small areas of skin like the palms, soles, and scalp. It is impractical to use in in extensive disease.' "
What is the long-term prognosis with psoriasis? What are complications of psoriasis?,"'Overall, the prognosis for most patients with psoriasis is good. While it is not curable, it is controllable. As described above, recent studies show an association of psoriasis and other medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and ''heart disease''.' "
Is it possible to prevent psoriasis?,"'Since psoriasis is inherited, it is impossible at this time to suggest anything that is likely to prevent its development aside from indulging in a healthy lifestyle.' "
What does the future hold for psoriasis?,'Psoriasis research is heavily funded and holds great promise for the future. Just the last five to 10 years have produced great improvements in treatment of the disease with medications aimed at controlling precise sites of the process of inflammation. Ongoing research is needed to decipher the ultimate underlying cause of this disease.' 
Is there a national psoriasis support group?,"'Yes, the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) is an organization dedicated to helping patients with psoriasis and furthering research in this field. They hold national and local chapter meetings. The NPF web site (http://www.psoriasis.org/home/) shares up-to-date reliable medical information and statistics on the condition.' "
Where can people get more information on psoriasis?,"'A dermatologist, the American Academy of Dermatology at ''http://www.AAD.org'', and the National Psoriasis Foundation at ''http://www.psoriasis.org/home/'' may be excellent sources of more information.''There are many ongoing ''clinical trials'' for psoriasis all over the United States and in the world. Many of these clinical trials are ongoing at academic or university medical centers and are frequently open to patients without cost.''Clinical trials frequently have specific requirements for types and severity of psoriasis that may be enrolled into a specific trial. Patients need to contact these centers and inquire regarding the specific study requirements. Some studies have restrictions on what recent medications have been used for psoriasis, current medication, and overall health.''Some of the many medical centers in the U.S. offering clinical trials for psoriasis include the University of California, San Francisco Department of Dermatology, the University of California, Irvine Department of Dermatology, and the St. Louis University Medical School.' "
What is psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis'' is a chronic skin inflammation. ''Psoriasis'' causes areas of the skin to be reddish with thick silvery, dry scales. ''Psoriasis'' can be itchy and sometimes painful. ''Psoriasis'' is a persistent disease that is caused by a misdirected immune system. Inherited genes and certain environmental conditions may also play a significant role in the development of psoriasis.' "
Is psoriasis contagious?,"'No. Psoriasis is not ''contagious''. Psoriasis is not transmitted sexually or by physical contact. Psoriasis is not caused by lifestyle, ''diet'', or bad hygiene.''While the exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, researchers consider environmental, genetic, and immune system factors as playing roles in the establishment of the disease. For example, environmental factors can trigger exacerbations of the disease, including cold weather, ''trauma'', infections, alcohol intake, and some chemicals and/or ''drugs'"". Certain genes are more commonly found in people with psoriasis, and psoriasis commonly runs in families. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease whereby one's immune system is misdirected to cause inflammation in the skin. Current treatments often take advantage of this concept by modifying immune responses to improve psoriasis. Moreover, it is also known that, occasionally, after an immunological-related event occurs (for example, recovering from ""'strep throat'', after antimalarial drugs, or cessation of steroid therapy) there can be activation of psoriasis.' "
How long will it take for someone to know if he or she has psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is diagnosed by the clinical appearance of reddish skin with silvery, white scales. Of note, there are different types of psoriasis (including ''pustular psoriasis'', ''guttate psoriasis'', ''erythrodermic psoriasis'', and ''psoriatic arthritis'') that are diagnosed by their appearance.' "
Can psoriasis spread?,"""Psoriasis is not contagious, so it can't spread from one person to another. However, in an individual, it is not unusual to have more than one area of skin involvement. Over time, additional body sites can develop psoriasis lesions. In general, psoriasis lesions develop on the elbows, knees, ""'scalp'', ears, low back, and between the buttocks.' "
Is there a cure for psoriasis?,"'Unfortunately, there is no cure for psoriasis. However, there are multiple ways to manage the ''disease. Medications, light therapy, ''stress'' reduction, adjunctive therapy sessions, moisturizers with salicylic acid, and sunlight are treatments. Some treatments can be used together. For best results, many clinicians suggest psoriasis be managed by a dermatologist skilled in treating this chronic disease.' "
When should someone consult a medical caregiver about psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis is not considered a medical emergency, but once a lesion or two develops on the skin that resembles the description for a psoriatic lesion, the individual should make a consultation with a dermatologist or an appointment with their doctor to consider initiating proper treatment.' "
What is scalp psoriasis? When can scalp psoriasis begin?,"'Psoriasis'' is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is estimated to affect about 2.2% of the adult population. In children, the onset of ''psoriasis'' can be before the age of one year but peaks around 5-8 years. ''Psoriasis'' produces scaly, ''itching'' ''bumps on the skin''. Some people may have a genetic predisposition to ''psoriasis''. The genes affected seem to be involved with control of the immune system. ''Psoriasis'' appears as red scaling, slightly raised ''bumps'' (''papules'') that merge to form plaques. ''Psoriasis'' classically appears on the elbows and knees, but it can affect any part of the skin. The ''scalp'' is also characteristically affected in many people. Like ''psoriasis'' anywhere on the body, ''scalp'' plaques produce excess scale and can ''itch''. Severe disease can cause a loss of scalp hair, which usually will return if the disease can be controlled. ''Scalp psoriasis'' somewhat difficult to treat when the scalp is covered with hair sufficient to act a barrier to the application of topical medications.' "
What are causes and risk factors of scalp psoriasis?,"'It is generally accepted that scalp ''psoriasis'', like all psoriasis, is related to genetic defects that affect certain parts of the immune system. There are undoubtedly environmental risk factors that trigger its initial development in genetically predisposed individuals. The notion that ""emotional ''stress''"" plays a causal role or at least exacerbates psoriasis has been difficult to prove. There is no question, however, that ''psoriasis of the scalp'' can be an extremely stressful experience.' "
What are scalp psoriasis symptoms and signs? Can scalp psoriasis cause hair loss?,"'Psoriasis appears as a small bump, a papule, surmounted by scale. When these ''papules'' coalesce, a plaque is formed that is often covered by thick layers of horny scale. When this scale is shed, it appears as ''dandruff'', which can be quite unsightly. Scratching these plaques, either because of ''itching'' or because of the impulse to remove it, is a very poor idea because of what is called the Koebner phenomenon (also known as the Koebner response or isomorphic response). This may cause psoriasis to develop in areas of inflammation and ''trauma''. Scratching off the scale will only make things worse. Although most patients do not note ''hair loss'', there can be extensive ''alopecia'' ''hair loss'' (''alopecia'') in severe cases.'  "
Scalp psoriasis vs. seborrheic dermatitis,"'Occasionally, ''seborrheic dermatitis'' of the scalp can be confused with scalp psoriasis since both can produce excess scale and can ''itch''. Pathological examination of the ''skin biopsy'' material occasionally may be helpful in distinguishing the two entities. As a practical matter, this is rarely necessary because most patients with psoriasis have typical psoriatic lesions present in other areas, such as the elbows, knees, or torso. In addition, both conditions generally respond to similar topical medications.' "
What physicians treat scalp psoriasis?,"'Dermatologists are specialists who deal with the diagnosis and treatment of many kinds of scalp conditions. Other physicians that can be involved in the care of patients with psoriasis include general and family-practice physicians, internists, and ''rheumatologists''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose scalp psoriasis?,"'The fact that the scalp is a hair-bearing area in most people produces challenges in diagnosis as well as treatment. If scaling plaques are present on portions of the body in a distribution characteristic of psoriasis, then the diagnosis of the scalp disease is much easier to make.' "
What are scalp psoriasis home remedies and topical treatments? Are there shampoos for scalp psoriasis?,"'The most important consideration in treating scalp psoriasis is getting an effective medication into the skin. Both the hair and any scale covering the disease act as an impediment to treatment. Removal of the scale in a nontraumatic fashion is very important. This can be accomplished by shampooing frequently. Using tar, selenium, or salicylic acid-containing shampoos can be helpful. This may have to be done at least twice a day initially if the scale is sufficiently thick. Gently rubbing off the scale with the fingertips and not the nails is important.''It should be appreciated that scaling is not due to dryness but to the excessive production of the horny layer of the skin. Occasionally, it may be necessary to cover the scalp overnight with mineral oil. To avoid an unpleasant mess, it is necessary to cover the head with a shower cap or swim cap. With moderate or severe scalp disease, the addition of a topical steroid is often required. The potency of the steroid would depend on the severity of the condition. The type of vehicle (lotion, solution, or foam) depends on physician and patient preference. It is important to remember that the medication must get past the hair in order to reach the scalp skin. Sometimes other medications may be of benefit, such as topical calcipotriene (''Dovonex'', ''Sorilux'') in a lotion or foam form. Some medications are available as combinations of topical steroid and calcipotriene.'  "
What are office treatments for scalp psoriasis?,"'Rarely, it may be of benefit to inject triamcinolone acetonide directly into psoriatic plaques. Aside from the ''pain'' involved, the benefit only lasts about six weeks at best. Ultraviolet light in wavelengths near 313 nm (narrow band UVB) is effective in psoriasis. The hair, however, can pose a barrier to effective administration unless it is removed or sparse. The excimer laser produces out laser light in these UV wavelengths also and can be of benefit if the amount of scalp involvement is limited.'  "
What medications treat scalp psoriasis?,"'If the scalp is involved as part of ''severe psoriasis'' deemed too extensive to be treated practically with topical medications, then medications delivered orally or by injection may be necessary. All these medications comprise more risk when compared to topical medication. They include oral ''drugs'' like ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), ''acitretin'' (''Soriatane''), ''apremilast'' (''Otezla''), and some of the so-called biological ''drugs'' that are administered by infusion into a vein (''infliximab'' [''Remicade'']) or by injection into the deeper layers of the skin like ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''ustekinumab'' (''Stelara''), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ixekizumab (Taltz). Regular laboratory work may be necessary to monitor for the toxicities associated with some of these systemic therapies.'  "
"What is the prognosis of scalp psoriasis? Is there a cure for scalp 
psoriasis?","'Since psoriasis is incurable unless there is a miraculous spontaneous resolution, those afflicted need to remember that constant care is required to keep it controlled. With diligent attention, scalp psoriasis can be controlled.' "
Are there support groups for individuals with psoriasis?,'Patient support groups like the ''National Psoriasis Foundation'' are valuable additions to medical care that can aid individuals dealing with the disease.' 
Facts you should know about psoriatic arthritis," Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (inflammatory arthritis). Some 15%-25% of people with psoriasis also develop inflammation of joints (psoriatic arthritis). The first appearance of the skin disease (psoriasis) can be separated from the onset of joint disease (arthritis) by years. Psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs includelow back pain,conjunctivitis,reduced range of motion,swollen joints,nail pitting,joint pain and morning stiffness,foot pain,fatigue,swelling of the toes and fingers (dactylitis). low back pain, conjunctivitis, reduced range of motion, swollen joints, nail pitting, joint pain and morning stiffness, foot pain, fatigue, swelling of the toes and fingers (dactylitis). Psoriatic arthritis belongs to a group of arthritis conditions that can cause inflammation of the spine (spondyloarthropathies). People with psoriatic arthritis can develop inflammation of tendons, cartilage, eyes, lung lining, and, rarely, the aorta. The arthritis of psoriatic arthritis is treated independently of the psoriasis, with exercise, ice applications, medications, and surgery."
What is psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (inflammatory arthritis). Psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the Caucasian population in the United States. Signs and symptoms include patchy, raised, red areas of ''skin inflammation'' with scaling. Psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the ''scalp'' and ears, the navel, and around the genital areas or anus. Approximately 15%-25% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. Patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis.''The onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Males and females are affected equally. The skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. In fact, the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of people. However, the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. In some patients, the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. In fact, some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! Conversely, patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis, leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.''Psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin, such as in the eyes, ''heart'', ''lungs'', and kidneys. Psoriatic arthritis shares many symptoms with several other arthritic conditions, such as ''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'"", and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. All of these health conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints, and the eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine, these health conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.""'  "
What causes psoriatic arthritis?,"'The cause of psoriatic arthritis is currently unknown. A combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors is likely involved. In patients with psoriatic arthritis who have arthritis of the spine, a blood test gene marker called HLA-B27 is found in about 50%. Several other genes have also been found to be more common in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Certain changes in the immune system may also be important in the development of psoriatic arthritis. For example, the decline in the number of immune cells called helper T cells in people with ''AIDS'' (''HIV'' infection) may play a role in the development and progression of psoriasis in these patients. The importance of infectious agents and other environmental factors in the cause of psoriatic arthritis is being investigated by researchers.' "
What are risk factors for developing psoriatic arthritis?,"'The major risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis is having a family member with psoriasis. This relationship has been recognized as so significant that it is used as a helpful part of the health history for the doctor to aid in the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. It might be that stressful life situations could affect the immune system, allowing for the expression and/or exacerbation of psoriatic arthritis. However, precisely how these emotional issues are related to psoriatic arthritis has not been established.' "
What are the different types of psoriatic arthritis?,"'The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical polyarthritis (both sides of the body), asymmetric oligoarticular, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and ''arthritis mutilans''.' "
What are psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'In most patients, the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. There can be tiny pitting nail changes of the finger and toenails. The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical, asymmetric and few joints, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and arthritis mutilans.''The arthritis frequently involves the knees, ankles, and joints in the ''feet''. Usually, only a few joints are inflamed at a time. The inflamed joints become painful, stiff, swollen, hot, tender, and red during flare-ups. There is usually loss of range of motion of the involved joints. Sometimes, psoriatic ''joint inflammation'' in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit (dactylitis), giving them a sausage-like appearance. ''Joint stiffness'' is a common arthritis symptom and is typically worse early in the morning. Less commonly, psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion, mimicking the pattern seen in ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the ''sacrum'' (sacroiliitis), causing other symptoms like ''pain'' and stiffness in the low back, buttocks, neck, and upper back. Occasionally, psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. A very destructive, though less common, form of arthritis called ""mutilans"" can cause rapid joint damage. Fortunately, this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis.''Patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis), tendon insertion points on bone (''enthesitis'', inflammation of the entheses), and around cartilage. Inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes Achilles tendinitis, leading to ''pain'' with ''walking'' and climbing stairs. Inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause ''chest pain'', as seen in ''costochondritis''.''Aside from arthritis and spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis can cause symptoms like ''fatigue'' and inflammation in other organs, such as the eyes, lungs, and aorta. Inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (''iris'') causes ''iritis'', a painful health condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. ''Corticosteroids'' injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent ''blindness''. Inflammation in and around the lungs (''pleuritis'') causes ''chest pain'', especially with deep ''breathing'' as the lungs expand against the inflamed areas, as well as ''shortness of breath''. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valves, leading to ''heart failure'' and shortness of breath.''Acne'' and nail changes are symptoms commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. Pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. ''Onycholysis'', or separation of the nail bed, may also occur. Interestingly, these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. ''Acne'' has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. In fact, a syndrome exists that features inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis), ''acne'', pustules on the feet or palms, thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis), and bone inflammation (osteitis). This syndrome is, therefore, named by the eponym ''SAPHO syndrome''.'  "
What types of doctors treat psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is generally treated by ''rheumatologists'', health specialists in diagnosing and treating arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Other doctors who may be involved in the care of patients with psoriatic arthritis include dermatologists and primary care doctors, including family and general practitioners and internal medicine specialists. When surgical treatment is needed for severe joint disease, orthopedic surgeons can be consulted. Other health care givers can include occupational and physical therapists.' "
How does a health care professional diagnose psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is a diagnosis made mainly on clinical grounds, based on the finding of psoriasis and the typical inflammatory arthritis of the spine and/or other joints. There is no laboratory test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Blood tests such as ''C-reactive protein'' and ''sedimentation rate'' may show an abnormal elevated result and merely reflect presence of inflammation in the joints and other organs of the body. Other blood tests, such as ''rheumatoid factor'', are obtained to exclude ''rheumatoid arthritis''. When one or two large joints (such a knees) are inflamed, ''arthrocentesis'' can be performed. Arthrocentesis is an office procedure whereby a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. The fluid is then analyzed for inflammation, infection, ''gout'' crystals, and other inflammatory conditions. ''X-rays'' may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine, sacroiliac joints, and/or joints of the hands. Typical X-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis, but these may not be present in early disease. ''MRI'' scanning is sometimes used to identify early erosion of joints. The blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27, mentioned above, is often performed. This marker can be found in over 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation.'  "
What are medications and treatment options for psoriatic arthritis?,"'The medical treatment of the arthritis aspects of psoriatic arthritis is described below. The treatment of psoriasis and the other involved organs is beyond the scope of this article.''Generally, the treatment of arthritis in psoriatic arthritis involves a combination of anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') and ''exercise''. If progressive inflammation and joint destruction occur despite NSAIDs treatment, more potent medications such as ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), corticosteroids, and antimalarial medications (such as ''hydroxychloroquine'' [Plaquenil]) are used.''Exercise programs can be done at home or with a physical therapist and are customized according to the disease and physical capabilities of each patient. Warm-up stretching, or other techniques, such as a hot shower or heat applications are helpful to relax muscles prior to exercise. Ice application after the routine can help minimize post-exercise soreness and inflammation. In general, exercises for arthritis are performed for the purpose of strengthening and maintaining or improving joint range of motion. They should be done on a regular basis for best results.''Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) are a group of ''over-the-counter'' medications that are helpful in reducing joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' sodium (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''). Their most frequent side effects include signs and symptoms like stomach upset and ulceration. The drugs can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Newer NSAIDs called ''COX-2 inhibitors'' (such as ''celecoxib'' [''Celebrex'']) cause gastrointestinal problems less frequently.'  "
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for psoriatic arthritis,"'Patients who experience progressive joint destruction in spite of NSAIDs are candidates for more aggressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Disease-modifying medications are important to prevent progressive joint destruction and deformity. These drugs include methotrexate, which is used orally or can be given by injection on a weekly basis for psoriatic arthritis as well as for psoriasis alone. It can cause bone-marrow suppression, as well as ''liver'' damage with long-term use. Regular monitoring of blood counts and ''liver blood tests'' should be performed during therapy with methotrexate.''Antimalarial medication, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), is also used for persistent psoriatic arthritis. Its potential side effects include injury to the retina of the eye. Regular ophthalmologist examinations are suggested while using this medication.''Sulfasalazine'"" (Azulfidine) is an oral sulfa-related medicine that has also been helpful in some patients with persistent psoriatic arthritis. Traditionally, Azulfidine has been an important agent in the medical treatment of ulcerative and Crohn's ""'colitis''. It should be taken with food, as it, too, can cause gastrointestinal upset.''Medical research has demonstrated effective treatment of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with ''leflunomide'' (''Arava''), a medication that is also used for the treatment of ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Medications that block the chemical messenger known as ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF) are another treatment option for moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis. The TNF-blockers ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''golimumab'' (''Simponi''), and ''certolizumab'' pegol (''Cimzia'') are also referred to as biologic medications and can be very effective for severe psoriatic arthritis. They can significantly improve or eradicate both the psoriasis and the arthritis as well as stop progressive joint damage. These medications are given intravenously or by injections. There is an increased risk of infection while taking biologic medications and patients are screened for underlying ''tuberculosis'' prior to TNF-blocker administration.''Ustekinumab'' (''Stelara'') is an injectable biologic medication that is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with or without methotrexate. This biologic works by blocking chemical messengers called interleukins. There is an increased risk of infections while taking ustekinumab.''Apremilast'' (''Otezla'') is an oral medicine approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate and for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast works by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Apremilast can have side effects, including an increase in ''depression'' and gastrointestinal upset such as ''diarrhea'' and ''nausea''.'""Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is an injectable biologic medication used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Secukinumab is an antibody that binds to and blocks interleukin 17, an important chemical messenger in the inflammation of the skin in psoriasis and the joints in psoriatic arthritis. After a month of weekly loading injections, it is given monthly, or by monthly injections from the start according to the doctor's discretion.""'Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth (such as ''prednisone'') or injected (cortisone) directly into the joints to reduce inflammation. Steroids can have side effects, especially with long-term use. These include thinning of the skin, ''easy bruising'', infections, ''diabetes'', ''osteoporosis'' and, rarely, bone death (necrosis) of the hips and knees.''While the relationship between the skin disease and joint disease is not clear, there are reports of improvement of the arthritis simultaneously with clearing of the psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis can benefit by direct sunlight exposure and are often treated with direct ultraviolet light therapy.''Finally, patients who have severe destruction of the joints may be candidates for orthopedic surgical repair. Total hip joint replacement and total ''knee joint'' replacement surgery are now commonplace in community hospitals throughout the United States.' "
What are psoriatic arthritis complications?,"'Psoriatic arthritis can be complicated by issues within the skin or the joints. The skin of psoriasis can become infected and require antibiotic treatments. The joints can become destroyed, deformed, and functionless. With aggressive medical treatment, however, these complications are generally avoidable. Psoriatic arthritis with eye, bowel, lung, or heart-valve inflammation can be complicated by disease in these areas. The degree of any injury depends on the location, the intensity, and duration of the inflammation.' "
What is the prognosis of psoriatic arthritis?,"'With aggressive treatment and monitoring of both the skin and the joints, patients can have an excellent outcome. It is particularly important to begin treatments early in the course of the arthritis for best results. Newer biologic medications can be extremely effective for those whose disease fails to respond to methotrexate or who cannot take it.' "
Is it possible to prevent psoriatic arthritis?,"'There is no method for the ''prevention'' of psoriatic arthritis. It is best to treat the skin optimally. Treatments that control the disease, in a sense, prevent recurrence of the arthritis. Because when they are discontinued, the inflammatory joint disease typically recurs.' "
Is there a psoriatic arthritis diet? Are there home remedies for psoriatic arthritis?,"'It has been shown that ''vitamin D'' might improve the arthritis of psoriatic arthritis. Research has shown this to be a helpful dietary modification. There is no other universally effective ''diet'', or foods to avoid, for psoriatic arthritis. There are also no dependable home remedies for psoriatic arthritis. However, ''vitamin D'' supplementation may be beneficial for both the skin and joints. In Europe, people have bathed in the Dead Sea for psoriasis treatment.' "
What does the future hold for patients with psoriatic arthritis?,"'The future treatment of psoriatic arthritis will evolve as more effective and safe medicines are developed. Areas of clinical research involve treatment with medications that can alter the immune systems of patients with psoriatic arthritis. As the immune system changes and genetics are better defined for psoriatic disease, the efficacy of medical treatments will improve.''For more information about psoriatic arthritis, please visit the following site: National Psoriasis Foundation (''http://www.psoriasis.org/'').'

What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump. A coordinated electrical signal is required for the heart muscle cells to contract in a coordinated way and generate a heartbeat. Normally, an electrical signal is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells found in the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the ''right atrium'' or upper chamber of the heart. This impulse spreads to the whole atrial muscle causing it to contract and push blood into the ventricle or the lower chamber of the heart. The electrical signal continues to a junction box between the ''atrium'' and ventricle (the ''AV node''), where there is a slight delay that allows the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood to the body. The signal continues throughout the ventricles and causes them to beat and push blood to the body. '  "
What causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), abnormal conduction of that electricity causes the ''atrium'', and secondarily the ventricles, to beat very rapidly. It is referred to as paroxysmal, because the rapid rate can occur sporadically and without warning and may also stop on its own. The rapid heartbeat may last a few seconds or many hours. Often the PSVT resolves before the patient reaches a health care professional.''In many patients with PSVT, there is a “wiring” problem in the ''AV node'' and instead of having just one pathway for electricity to travel to the ventricle, there are two. This allows electricity to circle back and cause the ''atrium'' to beat more quickly than it should normally. PSVT is one of many electrical abnormalities that cause the atrium to beat too quickly. These abnormalities were once lumped together and called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or PAT but, as more has been learned about the electrical wiring of the heart, terminology has been updated to better reflect the specific abnormal rhythm.''Some examples include''As well, there are numerous abnormalities in the ''AV node'' that cause rapid heartbeats and ''palpitations''. PSVT and other electrical abnormalities located in the atrium or AV node should not be confused with ventricular tachycardia, which arises from the ventricle and is potentially life-threatening.' atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome."
What are the symptoms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'One of the most common symptom of\xa0PSVT is heart ''palpitations'', often described as a ""rapid heartbeat."" There can also be a fullness in the throat that is associated with the rapid heartbeat.''Other symptoms include the following:''The symptoms of PSVT usually occur while the heart is beating quickly, but the ''fatigue'' can persist after the heartbeat returns to normal. By its nature, PSVT is intermittent and its onset cannot be predicted. As well, once the heart starts to beat quickly, there is no way of predicting if and when it will return to normal rhythm on its own. Some patients are unaware that their heart is beating quickly and PSVT is found only when the patient presents for care and is found to have a rapid heartbeat.'   Lightheadedness, Weakness and fatigue Shortness of breath Chest pressure Syncope (passing out)"
How is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of PSVT is based upon interpretation of the heart rate monitor and ''electrocardiogram''.'""Sometimes the diagnosis is difficult because the rapid heart rate resolves before the patient presents for medical care. In these cases, where there is a recurrent pattern of palpitations, the healthcare professional may suggest monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm as an outpatient. A Holter monitor is a small device that can be worn for 24 or 48 hours that records every heartbeat and may give a clue as to the underlying cause of the palpitations.""'A 30-day event monitor may also be considered, which gives a longer window to detect the rhythm. Again, a small monitor is worn, but with this device the patient triggers the recording when the palpitations begin. In some cases, specialized electrophysiology tests may be necessary to monitor the heart and try to reproduce abnormal rhythms.''For infrequent events, an implantable device (LINQ) can be placed just under the skin, and can scan for a month looking for rare rhythm changes.'  "
What is the treatment for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'There is a stepwise approach to treating the rapid heartbeat of PSVT. ''Vasovagal'"" maneuvers stimulate the vagus nerve and can slow the heart rate. Some options include holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement or splashing ""'cold'' water on the face. A care professional might cautiously ''massage'' the carotid artery in the neck, but in older patients, there is a risk of ''stroke'' and this procedure is usually reserved for younger patients.''Depending upon the heart rhythm, medications can be injected intravenously to reset the AV node or to decrease heart muscle excitability. Adenosine is a short-acting medication that is commonly used as a first-line drug to treat PSVT. Other treatment options for other atrial tachycardias include ''calcium channel blockers'', ''beta blockers'', ''digoxin'', and ''amiodarone''.''If the PSVT does not convert with intravenous medication or if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' or complains of ''chest pain'' or shortness of breath, ''cardioversion'' may be required. This means that an electrical ''shock'"" is given that resets the heart's electrical system to beat with a regular rate and rhythm.""  "
How can paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) be prevented?,"'PSVT can result because of underlying medical conditions or because of foods and medications that are ingested. ''Caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and ''over-the-counter'"" (OTC) cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine can stimulate and irritate the heart's electrical conduction system and precipitate an episode of PSVT. Decreasing or avoiding use of these chemicals completely may prevent PSVT. ""'Electrolytes'' abnormalities can cause heart electrical irritability. Abnormal thyroid levels can also precipitate ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Medications can be used to minimize the recurrence of PSVT, including calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or other antiarrhythmic medications.'""If PSVT continues to recur, an electrophysiologic study (EPS) can be done by a cardiologist and the electrical system of the heart can be mapped. If abnormal tracts or short circuits are found, they can be ablated or destroyed with high frequency radio waves and hopefully, prevent future episodes of PSVT. This is often a highly effective modality for patients with recurrent episodes who don't wish to have to take long-term medication."" "
What is ICU psychosis?,"'ICU psychosis is a disorder in which patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) or a similar setting experience a cluster of serious psychiatric symptoms. Another term that may be used interchangeably for ICU psychosis is ICU syndrome. ICU psychosis is also a form of delirium, or acute brain failure.' "
What causes ICU psychosis?," Sensory deprivation: A patient being put in a room that often has no windows, and is away from family, friends, and all that is familiar and comforting. Sleep disturbance and deprivation: The constant disturbance and noise with the hospital staff coming at all hours to check vital signs, give medications, etc. Continuous light levels: Continuous disruption of the normal biorhythms with lights on continually (no reference to day or  night).  Stress: Patients in an ICU frequently feel the almost total loss of control over their life. Lack of orientation: A patient's loss of time and date.  Medical monitoring: The continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs, and the noise monitoring devices produce can be disturbing and create sensory overload. Pain which may not be adequately controlled in an ICU  Critical illness: The pathophysiology of the disease, illness or traumatic event - the stress on the body during an illness can cause a variety of symptoms. Medication (drug) reaction or side effects: The administration of medications typically given to the patient in the hospital setting that they have not taken before. Infection creating fever and toxins in the body. Metabolic disturbances: electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels), and elevated liver enzymes. Heart failure (inadequate cardiac output) Cumulative analgesia (the inability to feel pain while still conscious) Dehydration"
What are the symptoms of ICU psychosis?,"'The cluster of psychiatric symptoms of ICU psychosis include:''In short, patients become temporarily psychotic.  The symptoms vary greatly from patient to patient.  The onset of ICU psychosis is usually rapid, and is upsetting and frightening to the patient and family members.  '   extreme excitement,  anxiety,  restlessness, hearing voices, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations, nightmares, paranoia, disorientation, agitation, delusions, abnormal behavior, fluctuating level of consciousness which include aggressive or passive behavior."
How is ICU psychosis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of ICU psychosis can be made only in the absence of a known underlying medical condition that can mimic the symptoms of ICU psychosis. A medical assessment of the patient is important to search for other causes of mental status abnormality such as:'""The patient's safety must be considered at all times."" stroke, Infection or sepsis Medication side effects or interactions low blood sugar, drug or alcohol withdrawal, and any other medical condition that may require treatment."
How is ICU psychosis treated?,"""The treatment of ICU psychosis clearly depends on the cause(s). Many times the actual cause of the psychosis involves many factors, and many issues will need to be addressed to relieve the symptoms.  A first step is a review of the patient's medications. The physician in charge of the patient along with the pharmacist can review each of the patient's medications to determine if they may be influencing the delirium.  ""'Family members, familiar objects, and calm words may help. ''Sleep'' deprivation may be a major contributing factor. Therefore, providing a quiet restful environment to allow the patient optimal sleep is important.  Controlling the amount of time visitors are allowed to stimulate the patient can also help. ''Dehydration'' is remedied by administering fluids. ''Heart'' failure requires treatment with digitalis. Infections must be diagnosed and treated. Sedation with anti-psychotic agents may help. A common medication used in the hospital setting to treat ICU psychosis is ''haloperidol'' or other medications for psychosis (antipsychotics). '' It should be understood that in saving a life in the critical environment, ICU psychosis sometimes may be a small price to pay for cutting edge, precise medical life-saving measures.  '  "
Can ICU psychosis be prevented?,"""The primary goal is to correct any imbalance, restore the patient's health, and return the patient to normal activities as quickly as possible. To help prevent ICU psychosis, many critical care units are now:"" using more liberal visiting policies,  providing periods for sleep,  protecting the patient from unnecessary excitement,  minimizing shift changes in the nursing staff caring for a patient, orienting the patient to the date and time,  reviewing all medical procedures with an explanation about what to expect,  asking the patient if there are any questions or concerns,  talking with the family to obtain information regarding religious and cultural beliefs, and  even coordinating the lighting with the normal day-night cycle, etc."
How long does ICU psychosis last?,"'ICU psychosis often vanishes magically with the coming of morning or the arrival of some sleep. However, it may last 24 hours or even up to two weeks with fluctuations of the level of consciousness and behavior patterns. Although it may linger through the day, agitation frequently is worst at night. (This phenomenon, called sundowning, is also common in nursing homes).''Fortunately, ICU psychosis usually resolves completely when the patient leaves the ICU.' "
How common is ICU psychosis?,"'Some estimate that one patient in every three who spends more than five days in an ICU experiences some form of psychotic reaction. As the number of intensive care units and the patient population in them grow, the number of individuals affected by this disorder will correspondingly increase.  With patients being transferred out of the ICU more rapidly than in years past; ICU psychosis may be more common in other areas such as the regular medical floor of the hospital or sometimes may even occur after discharge from the hospital.' "
What is an example of a situation of ICU psychosis?,"'Years ago, when we went to visit my father-in-law in a hospital ICU, we found him disoriented and very ''depressed'"". He couldn't hear or see well. It was like being in a medically-induced whiteout. His room was windowless. He was unable to listen to a radio, watch television or talk on the telephone. He had virtually no human contact other than brief visits by medical staff because he was in isolation with an infection. The staff he did see were in mask and gown and all looked alike. He felt cut off from human contact. He was sure he was going to die (which he didn't). He had ICU psychosis.""""It turned out that my father-in-law's customized hearing aid left lying on the nightstand had disappeared.  It had apparently fallen into the waste basket and been thrown out with the trash.  To safeguard his glasses, a well-meaning nurse suggested that his glasses be taken home. Hence, he could not hear or see much. Restoration of his hearing aid and glasses largely relieved his ICU psychosis."" "
Can ICU psychosis be dangerous?,"'Yes. To give another example, a friend fell seriously ill with a pulmonary infection some years ago, was very feverish, in considerable pain (from ''pleurisy'') and felt just terrible. She was put in the hospital ICU and had a large-bore intravenous catheter with fluids ''running'' together with several antibiotics. She was also given some medications to relieve the pain let me catch up on sleep. She fell asleep but awoke in the middle of the night totally disoriented, very agitated, hallucinating, etc. She had pulled out the IV catheter and was spouting blood all over the place. She was experiencing ICU psychosis. While still in the hospital, a repeat dose of the pain medications led to a repeat episode of the ICU psychosis. ICU psychosis can be dangerous, even life-threatening. It is best avoided if possible.' "
Introduction,"'Psychotherapy is often the first form of treatment recommended for ''depression''. Called ""therapy"" for short, the word psychotherapy actually involves a variety of treatment techniques. During psychotherapy, a person with ''depression'' talks to a licensed and trained ''mental health'' care professional who helps him or her identify and work through the factors that may be causing their ''depression''.''Sometimes these factors work in combination with heredity or chemical imbalances in the brain to trigger ''depression''. Taking care of the psychological and psychosocial aspects of depression is important.' "
How Does Psychotherapy Help Depression?,"'Psychotherapy helps people with depression:' Understand the behaviors, emotions, and ideas that contribute to his or her depression. Understand and identify the life problems or events -- like a major illness, a death in the family, a loss of a job or a divorce -- that contribute to their depression and help them understand, which aspects of those problems they may be able to solve or improve. Help to restructure ways of thinking, negative attributes and attitudes someone has about himself, and ways in which faulty thinking may perpetuate depression. Regain a sense of control and pleasure in life. Learn coping techniques and problem-solving skills."
Types of Therapy for Depression,"'Therapy can be given in a variety of formats, including:' Individual: This therapy involves only the patient and the therapist. Group:  2 or more patients may participate in therapy at the same time. Patients are able to share experiences and learn that others feel the same way, and have had the same experiences. Marital/couples: This type of therapy helps spouses and partners understand why their loved one has depression, what changes in communication and behaviors can help, and what they can do to cope. Family: Because family is a key part of the team that helps people with depression get better, it is sometimes helpful for family members to understand what their loved one is going through, how they themselves can cope, and what they can do to help.
"
Approaches to Therapy,"'While therapy can be done in different formats -- like family, group, and individual -- there are also several different approaches that mental health professionals can take to provide therapy. After talking with the patient about their depression, the therapist will decide which approach to use based on the suspected underlying factors contributing to the depression.' "
Psychodynamic Therapy for Depression,"'Psychodynamic therapy is based on the assumption that a person is ''depressed'' because of unresolved, generally unconscious conflicts, often stemming from childhood. The goal of this type of therapy is for the patient to understand and cope better with these feelings by talking about the experiences. Psychodynamic therapy is administered over a period of weeks to months to years.' "
Interpersonal Therapy for Depression,"'Interpersonal therapy focuses on the behaviors and interactions a depressed patient has with family, friends, co-workers, and other important people encountered on a day-to-day basis. The primary goal of this therapy is to improve communication skills and increase self-esteem during a short period of time. It usually lasts three to four months and works well for depression caused by loss and ''grief'', relationship conflicts, major life events, social isolation, or role transitions (such as becoming a mother or a ''caregiver'').' "
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression,"'Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) includes several different approaches to therapy, all of which focus on how thinking affects the way a person feels and acts. The idea of cognitive behavioral therapy is that you can change your way of thinking about a situation, and when you do, you also change the way you feel and act. As a result, you can feel better, and behave differently in response to life stresses, even when the situation stays the same.'""While other approaches to therapy rely heavily on analyzing and exploring people's relationship with the world around them, the focus of CBT is on learning. The therapist functions in many ways similar to a teacher. He or she guides the client through the process of learning how to change his or her way of thinking and then how to act on that learning. Because there is a specific goal and a process for arriving at it, CBT is often more narrowly focused. It also is typically completed in less time than other therapies.""'Two examples of different types of CBT are:' Rational emotive behavior therapy or REBT. REBT focuses on the way emotions affect thinking and actions. It helps the client recognize that the intensity of negative emotions can change the quality of his or her thinking. The result is often overreaction and loss of perspective. The emphasis of therapy then is on learning how to restore emotional balance by thinking more realistically about situations. Dialectical behavior therapy or DBT. DBT emphasizes the validity of a person's behavior and feelings and reassures the individual that those feelings and behaviors are understandable. At the same time, it encourages the individual to understand that the responsibility for changing unhealthy or disruptive behavior is his or her own."
Therapy Tips,"'Therapy works best when you attend all of your scheduled appointments and participate actively in the work of treatment. The effectiveness of therapy is not a passive process depends on your active participation. It requires time, effort, and consistency.'""As you begin therapy, establish some goals with your therapist. Then spend time periodically reviewing your progress with your therapist. If you don't like your therapist's approach or if you don't think the therapist is helping you, talk to him or her about it and/or seek a second opinion, but don't discontinue therapy abruptly."" "
Tips to Help You Get Started With Therapy,"'Remember, therapy involves evaluating your thoughts and behaviors, identifying stresses that contribute to depression, and working to modify both. People who actively participate in therapy recover more quickly and have fewer relapses. Therapy is treatment that addresses specific reactions to depression as an illness; it is not a ""quick fix."" It takes longer to begin to work than ''antidepressants'', but there is evidence to suggest that its effects may sometimes last longer, depending on the type of depression being treated. Antidepressants may be needed immediately in cases of severe depression, but the combination of therapy and medicine is very effective''WebMD Medical Reference' Identify sources of stress: Try keeping a journal and note stressful as well as positive events. Restructure priorities: Emphasize positive, effective behavior. Make time for recreational and pleasurable activities. Communicate: Explain and assert your needs to someone you trust; write in a journal to express your feelings. Try to focus on positive outcomes and finding methods for reducing and managing stress."
What is a brief psychotic disorder?,"'Brief psychotic disorder is one of a number of mental illnesses that are referred to as ''schizophrenia'' spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Characteristics of this disorder may include hallucinations or delusions that last no more than one month. Studies show that a true brief psychotic episode that does not progress to another mental illness occurs in anywhere from one to four per 100,000 people, more commonly in women than in men. This illness usually develops in people 30-50 years of age, and an episode tends to last an average of 17 days. This differs somewhat from people who suffer from any first-time psychotic episode, which occurs in about 100,000 ''teens'' and young adults in the United States every year, has a peak onset between the ages of 15-25 years, and more commonly affects males versus females.''In addition to the more commonly known mental disorders like ''schizophrenia'', other mental disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders group includes ''schizotypal personality disorder'', delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, ''schizoaffective disorder'', ''catatonia'', substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis due to a medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, as well as unspecified schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic disorders. Besides catatonia, other catatonia-related disorders include catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, as well as unspecified catatonia.' "
What are causes and risk factors for brief psychotic disorder?,"'Except for those psychotic disorders that result from the use of a substance or a medical condition, specific causes for most psychotic disorders are not known. However, the interplay of genetic (familial), biological, environmental, and psychological factors is thought to be involved. We do not yet understand all of the causes and other issues involved, but current research is making steady progress toward elucidating and defining causes of brief psychotic disorder and other psychotic disorders.''In biological models of psychotic disorders, genetic predisposition, infectious agents, toxins, ''allergies'', differences in brain structure, and disturbances in metabolism have all been researched. Psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder are known to run in families. For example, people who have a close family member who has suffered from an episode of brief psychosis are more likely to develop the disorder than people with no such family history. Toxins like ''marijuana'' increase the risk of developing psychosis. Some medications are thought to be associated with developing, while not directly triggering, this illness in some people. Studies have not seemed to find ethnic differences in developing brief psychotic disorder.''The current concept is that multiple genes are involved in the development of psychosis and that risk factors such as ''prenatal'' (intrauterine), perinatal (around the time of birth), and nonspecific stressors are involved in creating a disposition or vulnerability to develop the illness. Neurotransmitters (chemicals allowing the communication among nerve cells) have also been implicated in the development of psychotic disorders like brief psychotic disorder. The list of neurotransmitters under scrutiny is long, but special attention has been given to ''dopamine'', serotonin, and glutamate.''One form of brief psychotic disorder referred to as brief reactive psychosis has been found to be triggered by very stressful experiences, like placement in solitary confinement. People who have a low income, are unemployed, or are living alone are at higher risk for developing brief psychotic disorder than those who do not have these experiences.' "
What are brief psychotic disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of brief psychotic disorder can include the following:'   Delusions (beliefs that have no basis in reality) Hallucinations (for example, hearing voices or other noises not based in reality; seeing or otherwise perceiving things not actually present in any way) Disorganized speech (frequently off topic or nonsensical) Severely disorganized or catatonic behavior"
How do physicians diagnose brief psychotic disorder?,"'Since there is no specific test, like an X-ray, that can accurately diagnose a person with brief psychotic disorder, people who are concerned that they may suffer from this illness might consider taking a self-test, either an online or printable, like the Yale PRIME Screen, the Youth Psychosis at-Risk Test, the Schizophrenia Test, or the Early Psychosis Indicator.''To determine if a person suffers from brief psychotic disorder, health care professionals will conduct a mental health interview that looks for any history and the presence of symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, that were previously described. As with any mental health evaluation, the practitioner will usually seek to rule out other mental health conditions, including mood problems like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' disorders, ''panic attacks'' or generalized ''anxiety'', psychotic disorders other than brief psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, ''schizoaffective disorder'', or catatonia. In addition to guarding against having brief psychotic disorder misdiagnosed as another psychotic disorder or ''delirium'' (sudden ''confusion'' due to a medical or mental illness), the mental health examiner may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the diagnosis. Since brief psychotic disorder can co-occur with a life-threatening condition like delirium, the presence of those disorders will also likely be explored.'""The process of determining the presence of brief psychotic disorder will also likely include the professional trying to ensure that the person does not have a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms that are similar to those of brief psychotic disorder. The mental health professional will therefore often ask when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that may be necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical illness instead of or along with their emotional symptoms. Since the mental health interview is used in making the diagnosis and the significant impact that having brief psychotic disorder or a related diagnosis can have on the person's life, it is of great importance that the practitioner conducts a comprehensive assessment.""""In assessing for brief psychotic disorder, the evaluator will likely inquire if the individual's symptoms occur for the required one-day to one-month time period and are not better explained by a mood disorder (like ""'major depression'' or ''bipolar disorder'"" with psychotic features), another psychotic disorder, or occurs during the postpartum period (four weeks after a woman gives birth) is the result of the physical effects of a substance or other medical illness. The diagnosis should not be assigned if the person's symptoms are part of and sanctioned by the person's culture. Formerly, the term ""'brief reactive psychosis'' was used to describe the situation in which brief psychotic disorder occurs in reaction to events that most people would feel are very stressful (for example, ''trauma'').' "
What is the treatment for brief psychotic disorder?,"'Given the brief duration of brief psychotic disorder, medications tend to be an important part of addressing many of its symptoms. The first line of treatment includes atypical antipsychotics, for example:''The latter is rarely indicated specifically for the treatment of the brief psychotic disorder. This group of medications might cause ''weight gain'', drowsiness, and changes ion blood ''sugar'' and ''cholesterol''.''The first generation, or typical, antipsychotic medication also used for the treatment of schizophrenia, and includes medications like:''These are now known as ""neuroleptics"" because, while they tend to be effective in treating positive symptoms of psychosis (for example, ''paranoia'' or other delusions, hallucinations), many of the side effects they can cause affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Examples of such side effects are muscle ''stiffness'' or rigidity, jitteriness, ''tremors'', and muscle twitches. These older medications are thought to be not as effective against so-called negative symptoms like catatonia.''Since people with brief psychotic disorder are at increased risk of also having ''depression'', medications that address that symptom can be an important part of treatment. These include serotonergic medications like:''They are often prescribed because of their effectiveness and infrequent occurrence of side effects. Other ''antidepressant'' medications used to treat the ''depression'' that can be associated with brief psychotic disorder include:''Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (''CBT'') has been found to be helpful in helping the brief psychotic disorder sufferer manage some of the symptoms of this illness.

What are complications of brief psychotic disorder?,"'While most people who have an episode of brief psychotic disorder tend to never experience another one, some will go on to develop a more chronic psychotic mental illness like schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Some may evolve into having psychosis as part of a mood or personality disorder. As such, individuals who have brief psychotic disorder can be susceptible to the unemployment, fractured relationships, medical illnesses, and even early mortality of these other psychotic disorders .' "
What is the prognosis of brief psychotic disorder?,"'The prognosis of brief psychotic disorder tends to be better than that of other psychotic disorders and comparable to the prognosis of mood disorders that have psychotic features. Women, as well as anyone who has a history of having a healthy level of functioning before developing the illness, tend to recover best after suffering from brief psychotic disorder. Overall, women tend to recover and have no further recurrence of psychotic symptoms compared to men. People who receive treatment for this illness are less likely to suffer a recurrence compared to people who do not get treatment.' "
Is it possible to prevent brief psychotic disorder?,"""Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the person who has multiple risk factors for developing psychosis but has yet to have such symptoms, or who has had an episode of brief psychotic disorder, has been found to be effective at helping prevent such symptoms. In individuals who have had brief psychotic disorder, also providing his or her family with support and education about their loved one's condition has been found to be quite effective in the ""'prevention'' of recurrent psychotic symptoms in the individual with the illness. For women who have developed brief psychotic disorder in the form of ''postpartum psychosis'' in the past, preterm delivery of subsequent ''pregnancy'', and prevention of future ''pregnancies'' for extreme episodes has been found to help prevent further episodes of the disorder.'

Facts you should know about psychotic disorders," Psychotic disorders include schizophrenia and a number of lesser-known disorders. The number of people who develop a psychotic disorder tends to vary depending on the country, age, and gender of the sufferer, as well as on the specific kind of illness. There are genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological risk factors for developing a psychotic disorder. Usually with any psychotic disorder, the person's thoughts and behavior have notably deteriorated. When assessing a person suffering from psychotic symptoms, health care professionals will take a careful history of the symptoms from the person and loved ones as well as conduct a medical evaluation, including necessary laboratory tests and a mental health assessment. Most effective treatments for psychotic disorders are comprehensive, involving appropriate medication, mental health education, and psychotherapy for the sufferer of psychosis and his or her loved ones. It will also include the involvement of community support services, which patients often need. Prevention of psychosis primarily involves preventing or decreasing the impact of factors that put the person at risk for developing a psychotic disorder."
What are the different types of psychotic disorders? Are psychosis and schizophrenia the same thing?,"'Sometimes colloquially referred to as thought disorders, since the new psychiatric diagnostic manual, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') was published in 2013, psychotic disorders have been referred to as ''schizophrenia'' spectrum and other psychotic disorders. In addition to the more commonly known mental diseases like ''schizophrenia'', other mental disorders in this group include ''brief psychotic disorder'', ''schizotypal personality disorder'', delusional disorder, schizophreniform disorder, ''schizoaffective disorder'', ''catatonia'', substance-induced or medication-induced (for example, ''alcohol''-induced or cannabis-induced) psychotic disorder, psychosis due to another medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum disorder, as well as unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, which was formerly called psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS). As the number of different psychotic disorders indicates, while schizophrenia includes psychotic symptoms, psychosis and schizophrenia are not the same thing.''Besides catatonia, other catatonia-related diseases include catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, as well as unspecified catatonia. Women who recently had a baby (are in the postpartum state) may uncommonly develop ''postpartum psychosis''. Also, mood disorders like major depressive disorder and ''bipolar disorder'' can become severe enough to result in psychotic symptoms like hallucinating or having ''delusions'', also called psychotic features.'  "
How common are psychotic disorders?,"'The percentage of people who suffer from any psychotic symptom at any one time (prevalence) varies greatly from country to country, from as little as 0.66% in Vietnam to 45.84% in Nepal. While the figure of one out of 100 people who qualify for the diagnosis of schizophrenia may sound low, that translates into about 3 million people in the United States alone who have schizophrenia. Except for the usually middle-aged onset of delusional disorder (around 48 years of age), the first time a person has psychotic symptoms is usually between the ages of 18-24 years, with related but less severe (prodromal) symptoms often start during the teenage years. Statistics for postpartum psychosis include that it occurs in one or two out of 1,000 births but increases greatly, up to one in seven mothers, in women who had postpartum psychosis in the past. Men are thought to develop psychotic illnesses more often and at younger ages than women.' "
"What are causes and risk factors for psychotic disorders in children, teenagers, and adults? What does it mean to have psychotic tendencies?","'Some medical diseases or the use of certain substances may cause psychotic disorders. For most psychotic disorders, specific causes are unknown. However, physicians believe the interplay of ''inherited'' (familial), biological, environmental, and psychological factors is involved.  We do not yet understand all of the causes and other issues involved, but current research is making steady progress toward elucidating and defining causes of psychosis. For example, schizophrenia and ''bipolar disorder'' have many risk factors in common.''In biological models of psychotic disorders, researchers have investigated genetic predisposition, infectious agents, toxins, ''allergies'', and disturbances in metabolism. Psychotic disorders run in families. For example, the risk of the disease in an identical twin of a person with schizophrenia is 40%-60% and in other siblings is 5%-15%. A child of a parent suffering from schizophrenia has about a 10% chance of developing the illness, in contrast to the risk of schizophrenia in the general population being about 1%. Toxins like ketamine or ''marijuana'' increase the risk of developing acute (rapid onset) psychosis.''The current concept is that multiple genes are involved in the development of schizophrenia and that risk factors such as ''prenatal'' (intrauterine), perinatal (around the time of birth), and nonspecific stressors are involved in creating a disposition or vulnerability to develop the illness. Neurotransmitters (chemicals involved in the communication among nerve cells) have also been implicated in the development of psychotic disorders. The list of neurotransmitters under scrutiny is long, but researchers give special attention to ''dopamine'', serotonin, and glutamate.''Also, recent research studies have identified subtle changes in brain structure and function, indicating that, at least in part, schizophrenia could be a disease of the development of the brain. The fact that ''autism'' is a risk factor for developing psychosis during childhood seems to support that theory. Psychosis is more likely to occur in people who have poor medical health in a general sense or who suffer from another ''mental illness''.''Environmental risk factors, like a history of problem drinking, using tobacco, marijuana, or other ''drugs'', have been associated with the development of a psychotic disorder.''There are a number of medical risk factors for psychotic disorders. Steroid-induced psychosis is one example of the risk of certain medications causing this illness. Women who have recently delivered a baby (in the postpartum state) are at risk for a number of mental health problems, including postpartum psychosis. More than 25% of mothers with ''bipolar I disorder'' (those who have ever suffered from a full-blown ''manic'' episode, with possible symptoms of racing or other unwanted thoughts, pressured speech, and decreased need for ''sleep'') may develop postpartum psychosis, and more than half of those who have both a personal history of ''bipolar disorder'"" and a family history of postpartum psychosis tend to develop the condition. Children of mothers with a psychotic disorder may experience more than the genetic risk of developing a psychotic illness if their birth mother's ""'pregnancy'' with them was characterized by problems like malnutrition, infections, ''high blood pressure'', or problems with the placenta.''Psychological risks for developing a psychotic disorder include a history of mood problems, like an ''anxiety disorder'', ''major depression'', or bipolar disorder and trouble functioning socially or generally. People who are at risk for developing a psychotic disorder as the result of having a close relative with such symptoms are also more likely to have ''symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''). Individuals who have frequent ''nightmares'', tend to be suspicious of others or who have unusual thoughts (for example feeling paranoid, believing that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, having somatic symptom disorder) are also more likely to develop a psychotic disorder. Studies show that women with postpartum psychosis are frequently victims of ''domestic violence'' or abusive childhoods and often have histories of abandonment or ''substance abuse''.''Conditions classified as neurocognitive disorders, like ''delirium'' and major neurocognitive disorders, formerly called ''dementia'', can include psychotic symptoms. Delirium, a condition characterized by disruptions in attention and thinking (cognition), usually develops quickly, over a period of hours to days, and can include psychotic symptoms like ''hallucinations''. Major neurocognitive disorder, formerly called ''dementia'"", can have identifiable or unidentifiable causes and is characterized by a marked decline in cognitive functioning that results in the sufferer's having trouble doing things (like cooking or driving) independently; the symptoms do not only occur in the context of delirium and are not better described by another mental disorder.""'Children, ''teens'', or adults who have endured more negative life events, have poor housing, are more ethnically isolated where they live, or otherwise have little in terms of a support group are at higher risk for developing a psychotic disorder.' "
What are psychotic disorder behaviors and other symptoms and signs?,"""The definition of psychosis is a mental disease that includes symptoms like delusions or hallucinations that show impaired contact with and perception of reality. Usually with any psychotic disorder, the person's thoughts and behavior notably change.""'Behavior changes that might occur during a psychotic break include the following:''Changes/problems with thinking that may occur in a psychotic disorder include''A person with a psychotic disorder may not have any outward characteristics of being ill. In other cases, the illness may be more apparent, causing bizarre behaviors. For example, a person suffering from psychosis may stop bathing in the belief that it will protect against malicious individuals from attacking them.''People with psychosis vary widely in their behavior as they struggle with an illness beyond their control. Some may ramble in illogical sentences or react with uncontrolled anger or violence to a perceived threat. Characteristics of a psychotic illness may also include phases in which the affected individuals seem to lack personality, movement, and emotion (also called a ''flat affect''). People with a psychotic disorder may alternate between these extremes. Their behavior may or may not be predictable.''In order to better understand psychotic diseases, the concept of clusters of symptoms is often used. Thus, people with psychosis can experience symptoms grouped under the following categories:''Postpartum psychosis, now described as ''brief psychotic disorder'' with postpartum onset, usually develops within the first three months after  ''childbirth'', often within three to 14 days. Symptoms may include auditory or visual hallucinations, delusions, or rapid ''mood swings''. The hallucinations may have themes of violence toward herself or her baby. This condition may be associated with significant problems in thinking, ranging from disorientation and other symptoms of mental confusion and indecision to intrusive and bizarre thoughts. Also, symptoms can arise and disappear suddenly, with the mother appearing lucid one moment and exhibiting psychotic behavior the next.'   Social withdrawal/social isolation or loneliness Apathy Agitation, restlessness, hyperactivity, or excessive excitement Anxiety, nervousness, fear, or hypervigilance Hostility, anger, aggression Depersonalization (a combination of intense anxiety and a feeling of being unreal, detached from oneself, or that one's thoughts are not one's own) Loss of appetite Worsened hygiene and a lack of self-care Disorganized speech like rapid and frenzied speaking, incoherent speech, and excessive wordiness Disorganized behaviors, like a lack of discretion or restraint Catatonic behavior, in which the affected person's body may be rigid and the person may exhibit persistent repetition of words, a deficiency of speech, or be physically and/or verbally unresponsive. The catatonic individual might also engage in repetitive movements, slowness in activity, and thought or nonsense word repetition. delusions (beliefs with no basis in reality), hallucinations (for example, hearing, seeing, or perceiving things not actually present), the sense of being controlled by outside forces, and disorganized thoughts. Positive symptoms: hearing voices that are not actually present (auditory hallucinations) or other hallucinations (seeing things: visual hallucinations; feeling things: tactile hallucinations; smelling things: olfactory hallucinations, or tasting things: gustatory hallucinations); suspiciousness to the point of paranoia, feeling that one is under frequent or constant surveillance or pursuit (persecutory delusions), religious delusions like feeling one is a deity or other false belief of superiority; or making up words without a meaning (neologisms) Negative symptoms (deficit symptoms): social isolation, limited range of emotions, difficulty in expressing emotions (in extreme cases called blunted affect), difficulty in taking care of themselves, inability to feel pleasure, general discontent (These symptoms cause severe impairment.) Cognitive symptoms: difficulties thinking and understanding information, remembering simple tasks, attending to and processing information, and understanding their environment confusion Affective (or mood) symptoms: often manifested by depression, accounting for a very high rate of having thoughts and attempts at suicide in people suffering from schizophrenia and other types of psychotic disorders"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose psychotic disorders? What types of health care professionals treat psychotic disorders?,"""In order to determine whether the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder is warranted, the health care professional has to first consider if a medical illness may be the cause of the behavioral changes. If a medical disease is identified or the psychosis is found to be the result of exposure to a medication or drug, the sufferer is assessed as having psychotic disorder due to a medical condition or psychotic disorder due to toxin exposure or withdrawal, respectively. On the other hand, if a medical cause and toxin exposure have been looked for and not found, a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia could be considered. The diagnosis will best be made by a licensed mental health professional (like a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist), who can evaluate the patient's well-being and carefully sort through the diagnostic criteria for a variety of mental illnesses that might look alike at the initial examination, like schizotypal or schizoid personality disorder or a mood disorder with psychotic features like severe ""'depression'', or the ''mania'' phase of bipolar disorder. Other health care professionals who may treat psychotic disorders may include licensed social workers, psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners, mental health physician assistants, and sometimes non-psychiatric physicians.''Family members or friends of the person with psychosis can help by giving the doctor a detailed history and information about the patient, including recent life stressors, behavioral changes, previous level of social functioning, history of mental illness in the family, past medical problems and psychiatric disorders, drugs, and ''allergies'"" (to foods and medications), as well as the person's previous psychiatrists and other physicians. A history of hospitalizations is also helpful so that prior records at these facilities might be obtained and reviewed.""'The diagnosis of another psychotic illness may be distinguished from schizophrenia based on the duration of symptoms (as with brief psychotic disorder), the specific kind of psychotic symptoms that occur with delusional disorder, the type of nonpsychotic symptoms that occur with it as with ''schizoaffective disorder'', or what causes it, as with substance/drug-induced psychotic disorder and psychosis due to a medical condition. The diagnosis of other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder is reserved for those individuals who have some psychotic symptoms but do not qualify for a specific psychotic diagnosis. Women who recently had a baby (are in the postpartum state) who develop psychotic symptoms may be diagnosed with brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset, formerly called postpartum psychosis. Also, a neurosis like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder can become severe enough to result in psychosis symptoms, also called psychotic features.' The physician will examine someone in whom psychosis is suspected either in an office (for example, a primary care doctor or neurologist), in an emergency department (by an emergency-room physician), or a hospital. The physician's role is to ensure that the psychosis sufferer doesn't have any medical (referred to as organic) problems, including active drug use, since these conditions can mimic the symptoms of a psychotic disorder. The medical doctor takes the patient's history and performs a physical examination. Laboratory and other tests, sometimes including a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain, are performed. Physical findings can relate to the symptoms associated with psychosis or to the drugs or other substances the person may be taking.People with a psychotic disorder can exhibit signs of mild confusion or clumsiness.Subtle physical features, such as highly arched palate or wide or narrow set eyes, have been described in psychotic disorders, but none of these findings alone allow the physician to make the diagnosis. People with a psychotic disorder can exhibit signs of mild confusion or clumsiness. Subtle physical features, such as highly arched palate or wide or narrow set eyes, have been described in psychotic disorders, but none of these findings alone allow the physician to make the diagnosis. Generally, results are normal for most psychotic disorders for the lab tests and imaging studies available to most doctors. If the person has a particular behavior as part of their mental disease, such as drinking too much water, then this might show as a metabolic abnormality in the person's laboratory results."
What are the treatments for psychotic disorders?,"'Given the severity and often chronic nature of psychotic disorders, home remedies (for example, those not devised and administered by professionals) are not deemed to be appropriate. Antipsychotic medications are proven effective in treating acute psychosis and reducing the risk of future psychotic episodes. For example, the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic features thus has two main phases: an acute phase, when higher doses of medication might be necessary in order to treat psychotic symptoms, followed by a maintenance phase, which could be lifelong. During the maintenance phase, the medication dosage is gradually reduced to the minimum required to prevent further psychotic episodes. If symptoms reappear on a lower dosage, a short-term increase in dosage may help prevent a relapse.''Even with continued treatment of the more chronic or recurring psychotic disorders, some patients experience relapses. By far, though, the highest relapse rates for such diseases are seen when medication is discontinued. The large majority of patients experience substantial improvement when treated with antipsychotic agents. Some patients, however, do not respond to medications, and a few may seem not to need them.''Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of psychosis. They have been available since the mid-1950s, and although antipsychotics do not cure the illness, they greatly reduce the symptoms and usually allow the patient to function better, have better quality of life, and enjoy an improved outlook. The choice and dosage of medication is individualized and is best done by a physician who is well trained and experienced in treating severe mental illness.''The first antipsychotic medication was discovered by accident and then used for schizophrenia. This was ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), which was soon followed by medications such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''fluphenazine'' (''Prolixin''), ''thiothixene'' (''Navane''), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), perphenazine (Trilafon), and ''thioridazine'' (Mellaril). These medications have become known as ""neuroleptics"" because, although effective in treating positive symptoms (for example, acute symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, loose associations, ambivalence, or mood swings/emotional lability), they can cause side effects, many of which affect the neurologic (nervous) system. Examples of such neurologic side effects include muscle ''stiffness'' or rigidity, painful spasms, restlessness, ''tremors'', and muscle twitches. These older medications are thought to be not as effective against so-called negative symptoms such as decreased motivation and lack of emotional expressiveness.''Since 1989, a new class of antipsychotics (atypical antipsychotics) has been used. At clinically effective doses, none (or very few) of these neurological side effects of traditional antipsychotics, which often affect the extrapyramidal nerve tracts, are observed.''Clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), the first of the new class, is the only agent that has been shown to be effective in situations where other antipsychotics have failed. Its use is not associated with extrapyramidal neurologic side effects, but it can produce other side effects, including a possible decrease in the number of white blood cells. Therefore, blood cell counts need to be monitored prior to starting this medication, every week during the first six months of treatment and then every two weeks to detect this side effect early if it occurs.''Other atypical antipsychotics include ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), asenapine (Saphris), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and brexpiprazole (Rexulti). The use of these medications has allowed successful treatment and release back to their homes and the community for many people suffering from schizophrenia.''Although at least equally effective and often better tolerated, the use of these agents is also associated with side effects, and current medical practice is developing better ways of understanding these effects, identifying people at risk, and monitoring for the emergence of complications.''Most of these medications take two to four weeks to take effect. Patience is required if the dose needs to be adjusted, the specific medication changed, or another medication added. In order to be able to determine whether an antipsychotic is effective or not, it should be tried for at least six to eight weeks (or even longer with clozapine).''A major challenge for many people who suffer from a psychotic disorder is compliance with taking medication. Therefore, the availability of medication that only need to be taken on a biweekly or monthly basis may be of great benefit to some individuals. Fortunately, there are a number of medications to choose from, each of which can be taken daily by mouth or monthly by injection, including chlorpromazine (Thorazine), haloperidol (Haldol decanoate), fluphenazine decanoate, olanzapine (Zyprexa or Relprevv), risperidone (''Risperdal Consta''), paliperidone palmitate (Invega Sustenna), and ziprasidone (Geodon).''Since people with a psychotic disorder are at increased risk of also developing ''depression'', medications that address that symptom may be of great benefit, as well. Doctors often prescribe serotonergic medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima) because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects. Other prescribed ''antidepressant'' medications for the ''depression'' that can be associated with psychotic illnesses include ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'').''Because the risk of relapse of illness is higher when antipsychotic medications are taken irregularly or discontinued, it is important that people with a psychotic disorder follow a treatment plan developed in collaboration with their doctors and with their families. The treatment plan will involve taking the prescribed medication in the correct amount and at the times recommended, attending follow-up appointments, and following other treatment recommendations.''People with psychosis often do not believe that they are ill or that they need treatment. Other possible things that may interfere with the treatment plan include side effects from medications, substance abuse, negative attitudes toward treatment from families and friends, societal stigma about mental illness, or even unrealistic expectations about treatment. When present, these issues need to be acknowledged and addressed for the treatment to be successful.'  "
What are potential complications of medications used to treat psychotic disorders?,"'Many symptoms found in psychotic individuals are related to movement (motor symptoms). Some of these can be side effects of prescribed medications. Medication side effects may, for example, include ''dry mouth'', ''constipation'', drowsiness, stiffness on one side of the neck or jaw, restlessness, ''tremors'' of the hands and ''feet'', and slurred speech.''Tardive dyskinesia'' is one of the most serious, although quite uncommon, side effects of medications used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It is usually seen in older people and involves facial twitching, jerking, and twisting of the limbs or trunk of the body, or both. It is a less common side effect with the newer generation of medications used to treat schizophrenia. It does not always go away, even when the medicine that caused it is discontinued.''A rare but life-threatening complication resulting from the use of neuroleptic (antipsychotic, tranquilizing) medications is neuroleptic ''malignant'' syndrome (NMS). It involves extreme muscle rigidity, sweatiness, salivation, and ''fever''. If this complication is suspected, it should be treated as an emergency.''Other potential complications of antipsychotic medications include significant ''weight gain'' and sleepiness, depending on the medication. To address weight gain, prescribing physicians often counsel their patients with a psychotic disorder on ''nutrition'' and ''exercise''. Dose and timing adjustments may alleviate sleepiness. For ''pregnant'' women, the potential risks of the medication to a developing fetus must be balanced with the potential benefit to the mother and fetus of treating the illness.' "
Is it possible to treat psychotic disorders without medication?,"'In spite of successful antipsychotic treatment, many patients with psychosis have difficulty with motivation, activities of daily living, relationships, and communication skills. Also, since an illness like schizophrenia typically begins during years that are critical to education and professional training, these patients often lack social and work skills and experience. In these cases, the psychosocial treatments are all the more important, and many useful treatment approaches have been developed to assist people suffering from a psychotic disorder.' Individual psychotherapy: This involves regular sessions between just the patient and a therapist focused on past or current problems, thoughts, feelings, or relationships. Thus, via contact with a trained professional (like a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or psychoanalyst), people with psychosis become able to understand more about the illness, learn about themselves, and to better handle the problems of their daily lives. They can become better able to differentiate between what is real and what is not and can acquire beneficial problem-solving skills. Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation may include job and vocational counseling, problem solving, social skills training, and education in money management. Thus, patients learn skills required for successful reintegration into their community following discharge from the hospital. Family education: Research has consistently shown that people with a psychotic disorder who have involved families have a better prognosis than those who battle the disease alone. Insofar as possible, all family members should receive family-focused therapy, including emotional support and psychoeducation about psychotic disorders and be involved in the care of their loved one. Self-help groups: Outside support for family members of those with any psychotic disorder is necessary and desirable. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is an in-depth resource. This outreach organization shares information on all treatments for psychosis, including home care."
What are complications and the prognosis of psychotic disorders?,"'The fact that men seem to develop these illnesses at younger ages may contribute to men having more episodes of the illness that are more severe compared to women. People with a psychotic disorder typically have fewer interactions with peers, tend to prematurely leave school, have low self-esteem, and are at higher risk for experiencing unemployment, repeated psychiatric hospitalizations, and substance abuse compared to people without a psychotic disorder. Psychotic disorder sufferers also often have trouble accessing and receiving medical care and therefore are at risk of medical illness and early death from conditions like ''diabetes'' and ''heart disease''. While research reports vary on whether people with a psychotic disorder are at greater or less risk for developing different ''cancers'"", this population's vulnerability to having a poorer outcome from any medical illness highlights the importance of vigorous screening for cancers and other major medical conditions. The importance of assertively addressing the direct and associated symptoms of psychotic disorders is further indicated by the higher risk of ""'suicide'' or engaging in self-harm that sufferers experience.''While more than two-thirds of people who have a psychotic disorder may suffer a return of those symptoms at some time, the combination of medications, psychosocial treatment, and education of the psychotic disorder sufferer and their loved ones tends to greatly improve how well the person is able to function. The shorter the amount of time from when the person begins having psychotic symptoms to when comprehensive treatment begins, the better the prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent psychotic disorders?,"'Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'"") for the person who is at high risk for developing psychosis but has yet to have such symptoms has been found to be more effective than medication at preventing such symptoms. In individuals who have developed psychotic symptoms, providing his or her family with support and education about their loved one's condition have been found to be quite helpful in the prevention of the recurrence of psychotic symptoms in the individual with the illness. For women who have developed postpartum psychosis in the past, preterm delivery of subsequent pregnancy has been found to help prevent further episodes of the disorder."" "

What Is the Goal of Physical Therapy?,"'The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. ''Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. ''Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use ''walking'' aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. ' "
What Are Some Benefits of Occupational and Physical Therapy?,"'If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: ' You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well 
	informed. If you are overweight, a dietary plan can be created to reduce the 
	stress of excess weight on supporting joints of the back, legs, and feet. As 
	yet, no specific diet -- other than a diet designed for weight loss -- has 
	proved helpful for arthritis. You gain foot-care advice, including choice of well-fitting shoes with 
	shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly 
	to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve 
	performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications."
What Techniques Will I Learn?,"""You'll learn several techniques, including:"" Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise. Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change."
What Therapy Is Offered for People Recovering From Joint Replacement?,"'Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery.' "
What Joint Protection Techniques Are Offered?,"'There are ways to reduce the ''stress'' on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: ''An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: ' Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing 
	joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back 
	and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job 
	instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for 
	a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday 
	and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is 
	wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already 
	painful or stiff. Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or 
	tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller 
	joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap 
	rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting 
	dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy 
	loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, 
	squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate 
	methods or tools can usually be found."
What Are Assistive Devices for Arthritis?,"'If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work.''A few examples of helpful devices include a bath ''stool'' for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
Facts you should know about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)," Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an emotional illness that doctors first formally diagnosed in soldiers and war veterans and is usually caused by terribly frightening, life-threatening, or otherwise highly unsafe experiences but can also be caused by devastating life events like unemployment or divorce. PTSD symptom types include re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. PTSD affects 8 million adults in any one year. Girls, women, and ethnic minorities develop PTSD more than boys, men, and Caucasians. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) usually results from prolonged exposure to traumatic event(s), and long-lasting problems that affect many aspects of emotional and social functioning characterize PTSD. Symptoms of C-PTSD include problems regulating feelings, dissociation, or depersonalization, persistent depressive feelings, seeing the perpetrator of trauma as all powerful, preoccupation with the perpetrator, and a severe change in what gives the sufferer meaning. Untreated PTSD can have devastating, far-reaching consequences for sufferers' medical, emotional, and vocational functioning and relationships, their families, and for society. Children with PTSD can experience significantly negative effects on their social and emotional development, as well as their ability to learn. Although almost any event that is life threatening or that severely compromises the emotional well-being of an individual may cause PTSD, such events usually include experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, getting a frightening medical diagnosis, being the victim of a crime or torture, exposure to combat, disaster, or terrorist attack, enduring any form of abuse, or involvement in civil conflict. Issues that tend to put people at higher risk for developing PTSD include female gender, minority status, increased duration or severity of, as well as exposure to, the trauma experienced, having an emotional condition prior to the event, and having little social support. Risk factors for children and adolescents also include having any learning disability or experiencing violence in the home. Disaster preparedness training may be a protective factor for PTSD as can rapid intervention and certain personal, interpersonal, and environmental factors. Medicines that treat depression (for example, serotonergic antidepressants or SSRIs) or that decrease the heart rate (for example, propranolol) are thought to be effective tools in the prevention of PTSD when given in the days immediately after an individual experiences a traumatic event. SSRIs seem to be most effective in treating people whose PTSD is the result of noncombat-related trauma. Individuals who wonder if they may be suffering from PTSD may benefit from taking a self-test as they consider meeting with a health care professional. Professionals may use a clinical interview in adults, children, or adolescents, or one of a number of structured tests with children or adolescents to assess for the presence of this illness. Diagnosing PTSD can present a challenge for professionals since sufferers often come for evaluation of something that seems to be unrelated to that illness at first. Those symptoms tend to be physical complaints, depression, or substance abuse. Also, PTSD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders, manic depression, or with eating disorders. Challenges for the assessment of PTSD in children and adolescents include an adult caretakers' tendency to be unaware of the extent of the young person's symptoms and the tendency for children and teens to express symptoms of the illness in ways that are quite different from adults. Treatments for PTSD usually include psychological and medical treatments. Education about the illness, helping the individual talk about the trauma directly, exploration and modification of inaccurate ways of thinking about it, and teaching the person ways to manage symptoms and are the usual techniques used in psychotherapy. Family and couples' counseling, parenting classes, and education about conflict resolution are other useful psychotherapeutic interventions. Directly addressing the sleep problems associated with PTSD helps alleviate those problems, thereby decreasing the symptoms of PTSD in general. Medications that help PTSD sufferers include serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) and medicines that help decrease the physical symptoms associated with illness. Other potentially helpful medications for managing PTSD include mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Tranquilizers have been associated with withdrawal symptoms and other problems and are not significantly effective for helping individuals with PTSD. Some ways that are often suggested for PTSD patients to cope with this illness include learning more about the illness, occupational therapy including service dog therapy, talking to others for support, using relaxation techniques, participating in treatment, increasing positive lifestyle practices, and minimizing negative lifestyle practices."
What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?,"'Post-traumatic ''stress'' disorder (PTSD) is an emotional illness classified as a trauma- and stressor-related disorder as of the most recent edition of the diagnostic reference for ''mental health'' disorders, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'' or ''DSM-V''). Prior to this most recent edition, PTSD was classified as an ''anxiety disorder'' in the ''DSM-4'' (''DSM-IV''). This condition usually develops because of a terribly frightening, life-threatening, or otherwise highly unsafe experience. PTSD sufferers re-experience the traumatic event or events in some way, tend to avoid places, people, or other things that remind them of the event (avoidance), and are exquisitely sensitive to normal life experiences (hyperarousal). Although this condition has likely existed since human beings have endured trauma, PTSD has only been recognized as a formal diagnosis since 1980. However, it was called by different names as early as the American Civil War, when combat veterans were referred to as suffering from ""soldier\'s heart."" In World War I, the military referred to symptoms that were generally consistent with this syndrome as ""combat ''fatigue''."" Soldiers who developed such symptoms in World War II were said to be suffering from ""gross ''stress'' reaction,"" and many troops in Vietnam who had symptoms of what is now called PTSD were assessed as having ""post-Vietnam syndrome."" ""Battle ''fatigue''"" and ""shell ''shock''"" are other names for PTSD.''Although not specifically described in the ''DSM-5'', complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is recognized in the international manual for diseases, called the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). It usually results from prolonged exposure to a traumatic event or series thereof and is characterized by long-lasting problems with many aspects of emotional and social functioning. Compared to people who suffer from PTSD, those who have C-PTSD are at higher risk of engaging in self-harm, including ''suicide'' attempts and completion.''Statistics regarding this illness indicate that a low percentage of people in the United States will likely develop PTSD in their lifetime. Combat veterans and ''rape'' victims have a lifetime prevalence of PTSD. Somewhat higher rates of this disorder occur in African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans compared to Caucasians in the United States. Some of those differences are thought to be due to higher rates of dissociation soon before and after the traumatic event (peritraumatic), a tendency for individuals from minority ethnic groups to blame themselves, have less social support, and an increased exposure to racism for those ethnic groups, as well as differences between how ethnic groups may express distress. In military populations, many of the differences have been found to be the result of increased exposure to combat at younger ages for minority groups. Other important facts about PTSD include the estimate of 8 million people who suffer from PTSD at any one time in the United States and the fact that women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD.''Almost half of individuals who use outpatient mental health services suffer from PTSD. As evidenced by the occurrence of stress in many individuals in the United States in the days following the 2001 terrorist attacks, not being physically present at a traumatic event does not guarantee that one will not suffer from traumatic stress that can lead to the development of PTSD.''PTSD statistics in children and teens reveal that up to 40% have endured at least one traumatic event, resulting in the development of PTSD in up to 15% of girls and 6% of boys. On average, 3%-6% of high school students in the United States and as many as 30%-60% of children who have survived specific disasters have PTSD. Most children who have seen a parent killed or endured sexual assault or abuse tend to develop PTSD, and more than one-third of youths who are exposed to community violence (for example, a shooting, stabbing, or other assault) will suffer from the disorder.' "
What are the effects of PTSD?,"'Although not all traumatized individuals develop PTSD, there can be significant physical consequences of being traumatized. For example, research indicates that people who have been exposed to an extreme stressor sometimes have a smaller hippocampus (a region of the brain that plays a role in memory) than people who have not been exposed to trauma. This is significant in understanding the effects of trauma in general and the impact of PTSD, specifically since the hippocampus is the part of the brain thought to have an important role in developing new memories about life events. Also, whether or not a traumatized person goes on to develop PTSD, they seem to be at risk for higher use of cigarettes, ''alcohol'', and ''marijuana''. Conversely, people whose PTSD is treated also tend to have better success at overcoming a substance-abuse problem.'""Untreated PTSD can have devastating, far-reaching consequences for sufferers' functioning and relationships, their families, and for society. Complications of PTSD in women who are ""'pregnant'' include having other emotional problems, poor health behaviors, and memory problems. Women who suffered sexual abuse at earlier ages are more likely to develop complex PTSD and ''borderline personality disorder''. ''Babies'' who are born to mothers who suffer from this illness during ''pregnancy'' are more likely to experience a change in at least one chemical in their body that makes it more likely (predisposes) the baby to develop PTSD later in life. Individuals who suffer from this illness are at risk of having more health problems, as well as trouble reproducing. Examples of the physical health problems that PTSD sufferers are at higher risk of developing include ''arthritis'', ''heart disease'', and respiratory, as well as digestive problems.''Emotionally, PTSD sufferers may struggle more to achieve as good an outcome from mental health treatment as that of people with other emotional problems. In children and teens, PTSD can have significantly negative effects on their social and emotional development, as well as on their ability to learn.''Economically, PTSD can have significant consequences, as well. As of 2017, more than 900,000 veterans were receiving disability compensation for this illness, at a cost of $15 billion. This represents a 400% increase in the number of military people receiving disability benefits for PTSD since 2005.' "
What causes PTSD?,"'Virtually any trauma, defined as an event that is life threatening or that severely compromises the physical or emotional well-being of an individual or causes intense fear, may cause PTSD. Such events often include either experiencing or witnessing a severe accident or physical injury, receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis, being the victim of kidnapping or torture, exposure to community violence, war combat, or to a natural disaster, exposure to other disaster (for example, plane crash) or terrorist attack, being the victim of rape, mugging, robbery, or assault, enduring physical, sexual, emotional, or other forms of abuse, as well as involvement in civil conflict. Although the diagnosis of PTSD currently requires that the sufferer has a history of experiencing a traumatic event as defined here, people may develop PTSD in reaction to events that may not qualify as traumatic but can be devastating life events like divorce or unemployment.'  "
What are PTSD risk factors and protective factors?,"'Issues that tend to put people at higher risk for developing PTSD include increased duration of a traumatic event, higher number of traumatic events endured, higher severity of the trauma experienced, having an emotional condition prior to the event, or having little social support in the form of family or friends. In addition to those risk factors, children and adolescents, females, minority groups and people with ''learning disabilities'' or violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event.' "
What are PTSD symptoms and signs?,"'According to the ''DSM-5'', the following three groups of symptom criteria are required to assign the diagnosis of PTSD in the context of an individual who has a history of being exposed to an actual or perceived threat of death, serious injury, or sexual violence to self or others that does not involve exposure through media unless that is work related:''The emotional numbing of PTSD may present as a lack of interest in activities that used to be enjoyed (anhedonia), emotional deadness, distancing oneself from people, and/or a sense of a foreshortened future (for example, not being able to think about the future or make future plans, not believing one will live much longer). At least one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance symptom, two negative changes in mood or thinking, and two hyperarousal (fight or flight) symptoms must be present for at least one month and must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning in order for the diagnosis of PTSD to be assigned.''A similar disorder in terms of symptom repertoire is ''acute stress disorder''. The major differences between the two disorders are that acute stress disorder symptoms persist from three days to one month after the trauma exposure, and a fewer number of traumatic symptoms are required to make the diagnosis as compared to PTSD.''In children, re-experiencing the trauma may occur through repeated play that has trauma-related themes instead of or in addition to memories, and distressing dreams may have more general content rather than of the traumatic event itself. As in adults, at least one re-experiencing symptom, one avoidance/numbing symptom, and two hyperarousal symptoms must be present for at least one month and must cause significant distress or functional impairment in order for the diagnosis of PTSD to be assigned. When symptoms have been present for three days to one month, a health care provider can then make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder (''ASD'').''Symptoms of PTSD that tend to be associated with C-PTSD include problems regulating feelings, which can result in ''suicidal thoughts'"", explosive anger, or passive aggressive behaviors, a tendency to forget the trauma or feel detached from one's life (dissociation) or body (depersonalization), persistent feelings of helplessness, shame, guilt, or being completely different from others, feeling the perpetrator of trauma is all powerful, and preoccupation with either revenge against or allegiance with the perpetrator, and severe change in those things that give the sufferer meaning, like a loss of spiritual faith or an ongoing sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or despair.""   Recurrent re-experiencing of the trauma (for example, troublesome memories, flashbacks usually caused by reminders of the traumatic events, recurring nightmares about the trauma and/or dissociative reliving of the trauma): In children, this may include repetitive play about the trauma. Avoidance to the point of having a phobia of places, people, and experiences that remind the sufferer of the trauma, or a general numbing of emotional responsiveness Negative changes in thinking and trouble remembering important aspects of the trauma, holding negative beliefs about him or herself, a tendency to blame oneself for the trauma, a persistently negative emotional state, inability to have positive emotions, low interest or participation in significant activities, and feeling detached from others Significant changes in arousal and reactivity related to the traumatic event(s), including sleep problems, trouble concentrating, irritability, anger, poor concentration, blackouts or difficulty remembering things, reckless or self-destructive behavior, increased tendency and reaction to being startled, and hypervigilance (excessive watchfulness) to threat"
How do health care professionals assess PTSD?,"""For individuals who may be wondering if they should seek evaluation for PTSD by their medical or mental health professional, self-tests may be useful. The National Institute of Mental Health offers a self-test for PTSD. The assessment of PTSD can be difficult for practitioners to make since sufferers often come to the professional's office complaining of symptoms other than ""'anxiety'' associated with a traumatic experience. Those symptoms tend to include body symptoms (somatization), ''depression'', or ''drug addiction''. Studies of Iraq war veterans indicate that these individuals tend to show more physical symptoms of PTSD as opposed to describing the associated emotional problems.''Many people with PTSD may present with a history of making ''suicide'' attempts. In addition to depression and substance-use disorders, the diagnosis of PTSD often co-occurs (is comorbid) with ''bipolar disorder'' (manic depression), eating disorders, and other ''anxiety'' disorders like ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''), ''panic disorder'', ''social anxiety disorder'', and ''generalized anxiety disorder''.'""Most health care professionals who examine a child or teenager for PTSD will interview both the parent and the child, usually separately, in order to allow each party to speak freely. Interviewing the child in addition to the adults in his or her life is quite important given that while the child or adolescent's parent or guardian may have a unique perspective, there are naturally things the young person may be thinking, feeling, or doing that the adult is not aware of. Another challenge for diagnosing PTSD in children, particularly in younger children, is that they may express their symptoms differently from adults. For example, symptoms in children may include the child going backward or regressing in their development, becoming accident prone, engaging in risky behaviors, becoming clingy, or suffering from more physical complaints as compared to adults with PTSD. Traumatized younger children may also have trouble sitting still, focusing, or managing their impulses and therefore be mistaken as suffering from ""'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').''Sometimes, professionals will use a rating scale or a structured psychiatric interview for children in its entirety or just the portion that assesses PTSD in order to test for PTSD. Examples of such tools include the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV (DISC-IV), and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and ''Schizophrenia'' for School Age Children (K-SADS). There are also some PTSD-specific structured interviews, like the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-Child and Adolescent Version, the Child PTSD Checklist, and the Child PTSD Symptom Scale. For the assessment of the severity of PTSD symptoms in children, structured interviews like the Child Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Index, the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey, and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children are sometimes used. Some professionals find the Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire useful in predicting which children who endure a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD.' "
What is the treatment for PTSD?,"'Treatments for PTSD usually include trauma-focused psychological and medical interventions. Providing information about the illness, helping the individual manage the trauma by talking about it directly, teaching the person ways to manage symptoms of PTSD, and exploration and modification of inaccurate ways of thinking about the trauma are the usual techniques used in psychotherapy for this illness. Education of PTSD sufferers usually involves teaching individuals about what PTSD is, how many others suffer from the same illness, that extraordinary stress causes PTSD rather than personal ''weakness'', how it is treated, and what to expect in treatment. This education thereby increases the likelihood that inaccurate ideas the person may have about the illness are dispelled, and any shame they may feel about having it is minimized. This may be particularly important in populations like military personnel that may feel particularly stigmatized by the idea of seeing a mental health professional and therefore avoid doing so.''Teaching people with PTSD practical approaches to coping with what can be very intense and disturbing symptoms is a useful way to treat the illness. Specifically, helping sufferers learn how to manage their anger and ''anxiety'', improve their communication skills, and use ''breathing'' and other relaxation techniques can help individuals with PTSD gain a sense of mastery over their emotional and physical symptoms. The health care professional might also use exposure-based ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' by having the person with PTSD recall their traumatic experiences using images or verbal recall while using the coping mechanisms they learned. Individual or group cognitive behavioral psychotherapy can help people with PTSD recognize and adjust trauma-related thoughts and beliefs by educating sufferers about the relationships between thoughts and feelings, exploring common negative thoughts held by traumatized individuals, developing alternative interpretations, and by practicing new ways of looking at things. This treatment also involves practicing learned techniques in real-life situations. Intensive exposure therapy, which often involves multiple extensive sessions over several days followed by several weekly sessions over six months or more, is an evidence-based treatment that has been found to help people who have chronic PTSD. The Veterans Administration has invested in expanding the availability of this treatment to the people it serves.''Eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (''EMDR'"") is a form of cognitive therapy in which the health care professional guides the person with PTSD in talking about the trauma suffered and the negative feelings associated with the events, while focusing on the professional's rapidly moving finger during one-on-one treatment sessions. While some research indicates this treatment may be effective, it is unclear if this is any more effective than cognitive therapy done without the use of rapid eye movement.""'Helping PTSD sufferers maintain their employment and other tasks of their daily lives is an important part of treatment. Occupational therapy (OT) is an important treatment modality in that regard, in that it focuses on rehabilitation and recovery through participation in activities. This can range from assisting helping people with PTSD regain independence in basic self-care to helping them reintegrate into previously held work and community roles. Another potentially powerfully positive activity-based intervention for individuals with PTSD can be the use of a service dog. Particularly toward the completion of more conventional treatments, service ''dogs'"" have been found to be effective in improving PTSD suffers' sense of safety, responsibility, optimism, and self-awareness.""'Families of PTSD individuals, as well as the sufferer, may benefit from family counseling, couples counseling, parenting classes, and conflict-resolution education. Family members may also be able to provide relevant history about their loved one (for example, about emotions and behaviors, ''drug abuse'', sleeping habits, and socialization) that people with the illness are unable or unwilling to share.''Directly addressing the ''sleep'' problems that can be part of PTSD not only helps alleviate those problems but thereby helps decrease the symptoms of PTSD in general. Specifically, rehearsing adaptive ways of coping with nightmares (imagery rehearsal therapy), training in relaxation techniques, positive self-talk, and screening for other sleep problems can be helpful in decreasing the sleep problems associated with PTSD.''Medications that help PTSD sufferers include serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs), like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), and ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), and medicines that help decrease the physical symptoms associated with illness, like ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres''), ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex''), and propranolol. Individuals with PTSD are much less likely to experience a relapse of their illness if the person continues ''antidepressant'' treatment for at least a year. SSRIs are the first group of medications that have received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PTSD. Treatment guidelines provided by the American Psychiatric Association describe these medicines as being particularly helpful for people whose PTSD is the result of trauma that is not combat related. SSRIs tend to help PTSD sufferers modify information that is taken in from the environment (stimuli) and to decrease fear. Research also shows that this group of medicines tends to decrease anxiety, depression, and panic. SSRIs may also help reduce aggression, ''impulsivity'', and ''suicidal'' thoughts that can be associated with this disorder. For combat-related PTSD, there is more and more evidence that prazosin can be particularly helpful. Although other medications like ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), and ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq'') sometimes treat PTSD, little research has studied their effectiveness in treating this illness.''Other less directly effective but nevertheless potentially helpful medications for managing PTSD include mood stabilizers like ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''), ''tiagabine'' (''Gabitril''), and ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), as well as mood stabilizers that are also antipsychotics, like ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), asenapine (Saphris), and paliperidone (Invega). Antipsychotic medicines seem to be most useful in the treatment of PTSD in those who suffer from agitation, dissociation, hypervigilance, intense suspiciousness (''paranoia''), or brief breaks in being in touch with reality (brief psychotic reactions). The antipsychotic medications are helpful treatment options for managing PTSD when used in combination with an SSRI.''Benzodiazepines'' (tranquilizers) such as ''diazepam'' (''Valium'') and ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax'') have unfortunately been associated with a number of problems, including withdrawal symptoms, and risks of overdose and ''addiction'', and have not been found to be significantly effective for helping individuals with PTSD.'  "
Is it possible to prevent PTSD?,"'While disaster-preparedness training is a good idea in terms of improving the immediate physical safety and logistical issues involved with a traumatic event, such training may also provide important preventive factors against developing PTSD. That is as evidenced by the fact that those with more professional-level training and experience (for example, police, firefighters, mental health professionals, paramedics, and other medical professionals) tend to develop PTSD less often when coping with disaster than those without the benefit of such training or experience. People who have experienced trauma but are not members of those professions have been found to be less likely to develop PTSD if they receive imaging exposure and therapeutic processing by trained professionals within a day of the trauma and weekly sessions for at least two weeks thereafter.''There are medications that help prevent the development of PTSD. Some medicines that treat depression, decrease the heart rate, or increase the action of other body chemicals are effective tools in the prevention of PTSD when given in the days immediately after an individual experiences a traumatic event.' "
What is the prognosis for PTSD?,"'A number of factors improve the prognosis (outlook) for people with PTSD. They include personal attributes like above-average cognitive abilities, high self-esteem and optimism, interpersonal abilities like good social skills, problem solving, and impulse control, and external factors like secure attachment, sense of safety, and environmental stability.' "
How can people cope with PTSD?,"'Some suggested ways for PTSD patients to cope with this illness include learning more about the disorder as well as talking to friends, family, professionals, and PTSD survivors for support. Joining a support group may be helpful. Other tips include reducing stress by using relaxation techniques (for example, breathing exercises, positive imagery), actively participating in treatment as recommended by professionals, increasing positive lifestyle practices (for example, ''exercise'', healthy eating, distracting oneself through keeping a healthy work schedule if employed, volunteering whether employed or not), and minimizing negative lifestyle practices like substance abuse, social isolation, working to excess, and self-destructive or ''suicidal'' behaviors.'

What is puberty?,"'Puberty is the period during which growing boys or girls undergo the process of sexual maturation. Puberty involves a series of physical stages or steps that lead to the achievement of fertility and the development of the so-called secondary sex characteristics, the physical features associated with adult males and females (such as the growth of pubic hair). While puberty involves a series of biological or physical transformations, the process can also have an effect on the psychosocial and emotional development of the adolescent.' "
At is the timing of puberty in girls and boys?,"'Doctors do not completely understand the timing of the onset of puberty; a number of factors likely determine its onset. One theory proposes that reaching a critical weight or body composition may play a role in the onset of puberty. The increase in ''childhood obesity'' may be related to the overall earlier onset of puberty in the general population in recent years.''Leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells (adipocytes) in the body, has been suggested as one possible mediator of the timing of puberty. In research studies, animals deficient in leptin did not undergo puberty, but puberty began when leptin was administered to the animals. Further, girls with higher concentrations of the hormone leptin are known to have an increased percentage of body fat and an earlier onset of puberty than girls with lower levels of leptin. The concentration of leptin in the blood is known to increase just before puberty in both boys and girls.''Leptin, however, is likely only one of multiple influences on the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that releases a hormone known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn signals the ''pituitary gland'' to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and ''follicle-stimulating hormone'' (FSH). LH and FSH secretion by the pituitary is responsible for sexual development through regulation of the production of estrogen and testosterone.''Genetic factors are likely involved in the timing of puberty, and the timing of puberty tends to ""run in families."" Additionally, a gene has been identified that appears to be critical for the normal development of puberty. The gene, known as GPR54, encodes a protein that appears to have an effect on the secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus. Individuals who do not have a functioning copy of this gene are not able to enter puberty normally.' "
What age does puberty start in girls and boys?,"'The onset of puberty varies among individuals. Puberty usually occurs in girls between the ages of 10 and 14, while in boys it generally occurs later, between the ages of 12 and 16. In some African-American girls, puberty begins earlier, at about age 9, meaning that puberty occurs from ages 9 to 14.''Adolescent girls reach puberty today at earlier ages than were ever recorded previously. Nutritional and other environmental influences may be responsible for this change. For example, the average age of the onset of menstrual periods in girls was 15 in 1900. By the 1990s, this average had dropped to 12 and a half years of age.' "
What are the physical stages of puberty in girls and boys?,"'The body changes that happen during the process of puberty have a typical pattern in both boys and girls, with a generally predictable sequence of events. In most girls, the first sign of puberty is the beginning of breast development (breast buds), which occurs at an average age of approximately 11 years. In girls, the growth of pubic hair typically begins after breast development, followed by the growth of hair in the armpits. A minority of girls, however, begin to develop pubic hair prior to breast development. The onset of ''menstruation'' (having periods) usually happens later than the other physical changes and usually occurs around two and a half years after the onset of puberty.''A regular pattern of ''ovulation'', corresponding to achievement of fertility, usually develops rapidly once a girl begins having menstrual periods (the onset of ''menstruation'' or first period is known as menarche). However, girls who have a later onset of menstruation (after age 13) tend to have lower rates of regular ovulation in the years following the onset of menstruation. Studies have shown that one-half of adolescent girls who first begin to menstruate after age 13 will not ovulate regularly over the next four and a half years.''In boys, an increase in the size of the testicles is the first change observed at the onset of puberty. Enlargement of the testicles begins at an approximate average age of 11 and a half years in boys and lasts for about six months. After enlargement of the testicles, the penis also increases in size. Enlargement of the testicles and penis almost always occurs before the development of pubic hair. The next stage is the growth of pubic area hair and hair in the armpits. Next, the voice becomes deeper and muscles increase in size. The last step is usually the development of facial hair.''Fertility is achieved in males near the onset of puberty, when a surge in testosterone triggers the production of sperm.''The sequence of changes in puberty has been characterized by physicians and is referred to as sexual maturity rating (SMR) or Tanner stages, named after a physician who published a description of the sequence of physical changes in puberty in 1969. Tanner stages are determined by the development of the secondary sex characteristics and encompass changes in the size and appearance of the external genitalia, the development of pubic hair, and breast development in girls. Tanner stages allow doctors to classify the extent of development of sex characteristics into five distinct steps ranging from stage 1 (prepubertal) to stage 5 (mature adult type).'  "
What other changes in the body occur during puberty in boys and girls?,"'A rapid increase in height, referred to as a growth spurt, usually accompanies puberty. This rapid increase in height typically lasts for two to three years. About 17%-18% of adult height is attained during puberty. Although the increase in height affects both the trunk and the limbs, growth in the limbs usually happens first. The growth spurt characteristically occurs earlier in girls than in boys, with girls having the growth spurt approximately two years prior to boys, on average. In girls, the growth spurt typically precedes the onset of menstruation by about six months.''Growth of bones and increases in ''bone density'' in both boys and girls accompany puberty. In girls, bone mineralization peaks around the time of the onset of menstrual periods, after the time of peak height velocity (growth spurt). Studies have shown that bone width increases first, followed by bone mineral content, and lastly by bone density. Because of the lag between bone growth and achievement of full bone density, adolescents may be at increased risk for ''fractures'' during this time.''Changes in weight and body composition occur in both boys and girls. Adolescent girls develop a greater proportion of body fat than boys, with redistribution of the fat toward the upper and lower portions of the body, leading to a curvier appearance. While boys also have an increase in the growth of body fat, their muscle growth is faster. By the end of puberty, boys have a muscle mass about one and a half times greater than that of comparably sized girls.''Maturation of the cardiovascular systems and ''lungs'' results in an increased working capacity of these organs, associated with an overall increase in endurance and strength. These changes are more pronounced in boys than in girls.'  "
What emotional changes occur in puberty in boys and girls?,"'Both boys and girls can experience emotional changes that accompany the myriad physical changes of puberty. These changes are not the same for all adolescents. Changes can occur in the way a teen responds to family or friends and views him- or herself. Many adolescents are self-conscious and may experience ''mood swings'', ''anxiety'', ''confusion'', and sensitivity. On the other hand, not all emotional changes of puberty are related to negative thoughts or feeling upset. Puberty is also a time in which the young person learns about his or her own interests and goals and learns to relate to others in a more mature way. While some emotional changes are a normal part of puberty, it is important to seek medical help if these emotional changes are unusually severe, affect day-to-day functioning, or result in thoughts of harming oneself or others.' "
What are the medical concerns associated with normal puberty in girls and boys?,"'While puberty is a normal condition and not an illness, many medical conditions and illnesses may first appear during puberty. Some conditions potentially associated with puberty include the following:'  Acne: Acne is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands and hair follicles of the skin, which is most pronounced on the face but may occur on the neck, back, chest, or other areas. The hormonal changes in puberty lead to the development of acne in many adolescent boys and girls. Gynecomastia: Gynecomastia is the term used to describe enlargement of the male breasts. The hormonal changes of puberty can cause a transient gynecomastia in normal boys that typically lasts for 6 to 18 months. Pubertal gynecomastia occurs at an average age of 13 in boys and affects up to one-half of normal adolescent boys. Anemia: The normal pubertal progression in males is associated with increases in the ferritin (iron) and hemoglobin concentrations in the blood, but this increase is not observed in females. Adolescent girls tend to consume less iron-containing foods than boys, and this, combined with blood losses through menstrual bleeding, may place adolescent girls at risk for anemia. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): If teens become sexually active at puberty, they are at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Scoliosis: Because of rapid growth during puberty, scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine) can be worsened or may first become apparent during puberty. Vision changes: Nearsightedness (myopia) has a high incidence during puberty because of growth in the axial diameter of the eye. Musculoskeletal injuries: Adolescents may be particularly prone to musculoskeletal injuries during the growth spurt and during growth of muscle mass. Since bone growth usually precedes full bone mineralization, adolescents are at risk for fractures. Also, since the growth in the limbs usually occurs prior to growth in the trunk, some joints may be left with a limited range of motion that increases the risk for sprains and strains. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding: Girls who have recently begun menstruating may have irregular, prolonged, or heavy menstrual bleeding. Anovulation (not ovulating) is the most common reason for abnormal menstrual bleeding in adolescent girls."
What are medical conditions associated with early or late puberty in girls and boys?,"'Precocious puberty is the medical term for early puberty. This is sometimes referred to as ''central precocious puberty'"" or CPP when it is due to the brain releasing hormones that control puberty at an earlier age than normal. While medical professionals are not in full agreement about the age ranges for the definition of precocious puberty, many doctors believe that a medical evaluation for precocious puberty should be performed if the signs and symptoms of puberty (breast or pubic hair development) occur prior to age 7 in Caucasian girls and prior to age 6 in African-American girls. Boys who show signs of developing secondary sex characteristics prior to age 9 are also considered to have precocious puberty. Precocious puberty can be associated with psychological difficulties that may impact a child's emotional development.""'Precocious puberty is much more common in girls than in boys. Many girls experience precocious puberty in the absence of any disease or condition. In boys, however, precocious puberty is more likely to be associated with an underlying medical problem. While in many cases the exact cause of precocious puberty cannot be determined, a small number of cases are related to abnormalities of the ovaries or testes, thyroid gland abnormalities or other hormone problems, genetic conditions, tumors or infections of the brain, and injury to the brain.''Precocious puberty may be treated by treating the underlying condition that is responsible for the condition or by lowering the high levels of sex hormones with medications (known as GnRH agonists) that block the production of sex hormones to stop sexual development from progressing.''Delayed puberty is the late onset of puberty. Puberty is usually considered to be delayed when there has been no increase in testicular volume by 14 years of age in boys and no breast development by 13 and a half years of age in girls. Sometimes, delayed puberty tends to ""run in families,"" and normal adolescent development proceeds normally after the delay. This is sometimes called a constitutional delay and is responsible for the vast majority of cases of delayed puberty. Constitutional delay that affects both growth and achievement of puberty is much more common in boys than in girls.''Chronic medical conditions, such as ''diabetes'' or ''cystic fibrosis'', may also cause the delayed onset of puberty. Genetic conditions, problems with the pituitary or thyroid glands, problems with the ovaries or testes, and malnutrition are other causes of delayed puberty. Many girls who ''exercise'' strenuously have very little body fat and also experience a delay in the onset of puberty, since a certain amount of body fat appears to be required for the initiation of puberty. Girls who are competitive athletes may have a delay in the onset of menstruation of up to one year or more when compared with nonathletes.'  "

Many girls who ''exercise'' strenuously have very little body fat and also experience a delay in the onset of puberty, since a certain amount of body fat appears to be required for the initiation of puberty. Girls who are competitive athletes may have a delay in the onset of menstruation of up to one year or more when compared with nonathletes.'  "
What Are Pubic Lice?,"'Also called crab lice or ""crabs,"" pubic lice are parasitic insects found primarily in the pubic or genital area of humans. Pubic lice infestation is found worldwide and occurs in all races, ethnic groups, and levels of society.' "
What Do Pubic Lice Look Like?,"'Pubic lice have forms: the egg (also called a ''nit''), the nymph, and the adult.''Nit: ''Nits are lice eggs. They can be hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Pubic lice nits take about 6-10 days to hatch.''Nymph:'' The nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the nit (egg). A nymph looks like an adult pubic louse but it is smaller. Pubic lice nymphs take about 2-3 weeks after hatching to mature into adults capable of reproducing. To live, a nymph must feed on blood.''Adult:'' The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs; their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab. This is how they got the nickname ""crabs."" Pubic lice are tan to grayish-white in color. Females lay nits and are usually larger than males. To live, lice must feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1-2 days.' "
Where Are Pubic Lice Found?,"'Pubic lice usually are found in the genital area on pubic hair; but they may occasionally be found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Lice found on the head generally ''head lice'', not pubic lice.''Animals do not get or spread pubic lice.' "
What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Pubic Lice?,'Signs and symptoms of pubic lice include:'  Itching in the genital area Visible nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice
How Did I Get Pubic Lice?,"'Pubic lice usually are spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. Pubic lice found on children may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse. Occasionally, pubic lice may be spread by close personal contact or contact with articles such as clothing, bed linens, or towels that have been used by an infested person. A common misunderstanding is that pubic lice are spread easily by sitting on a toilet seat. This would be extremely rare because lice cannot live long away from a warm ''human body'' and they do not have ''feet'' designed to hold onto or walk on smooth surfaces such as toilet seats.''Persons infested with pubic lice should be investigated for the presence of other ''sexually transmitted diseases''.' "
How Is a Pubic Lice Infestation Diagnosed?,"'A pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a ""crab"" louse or egg (nit) on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body (eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, perianal area, groin, trunk, ''scalp''). Pubic lice may be difficult to find because there may be only a few. Pubic lice often attach themselves to more than one hair and generally do not crawl as quickly as head and ''body lice''. If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits in the pubic area strongly suggests that a person is infested and should be treated. If you are unsure about infestation or if treatment is not successful, see a health care provider for a diagnosis. Persons infested with pubic lice should be investigated for the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases.''Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, a magnifying ''lens'' may be necessary to find lice or eggs.' "
How Are Pubic Lice Treated?,"'A lice-killing lotion containing 1% permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide can be used to treat pubic (""crab"") lice. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. These medications are safe and effective when used exactly according to the instructions in the package or on the label.''Lindane shampoo is a prescription medication that can kill lice and lice eggs. However, lindane is not recommended as a first-line therapy. Lindane can be toxic to the brain and other parts of the nervous system; its use should be restricted to patients who have failed treatment with or cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat premature infants, persons with a ''seizure'' disorder, women who are ''pregnant'' or breast-feeding, persons who have very irritated skin or sores where the lindane will be applied, infants, children, the elderly, and persons who weigh less than 110 pounds.''Malathion* lotion 0.5% (''Ovide''*) is a prescription medication that can kill lice and some lice eggs; however, malathion lotion (Ovide*) currently has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of pubic (""crab"") lice.''Ivermectin'' has been used successfully to treat lice; however, ivermectin currently has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of lice.''How to treat pubic lice infestations:'' (Warning: See special instructions for treatment of lice and nits on eyebrows or eyelashes. The lice medications described in this section should not be used near the eyes.)''*Use of trade names is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.'  Wash the infested area; towel dry. Carefully follow the instructions in the package or on the label. Thoroughly saturate the pubic hair and other infested areas with lice medication. Leave medication on hair for the time recommended in the instructions. After waiting the recommended time, remove the medication by following carefully the instructions on the label or in the box. Following treatment, most nits will still be attached to hair shafts. Nits may be removed with fingernails or by using a fine-toothed comb. Put on clean underwear and clothing after treatment. To kill any lice or nits remaining on clothing, towels, or bedding, machine-wash and machine-dry those items that the infested person used during the 2-3 days before treatment. Use hot water (at least 130°F) and the hot dryer cycle. Items that cannot be laundered can be dry-cleaned or stored in a sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks. All sex partners from within the previous month should be informed that they are at risk for infestation and should be treated. Persons should avoid sexual contact with their sex partner(s) until both they and their partners have been successfully treated and reevaluated to rule out persistent infestation. Repeat treatment in 9-10 days if live lice are still found. Persons with pubic lice should be evaluated for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If only a few live lice and nits are present, it may be possible to remove these with fingernails or a nit comb. If additional treatment is needed for lice or nits on the eyelashes, careful application of ophthalmic-grade petrolatum ointment (only available by prescription) to the eyelid margins 2-4 times a day for 10 days is effective. Regular Vaseline* should not be used because it can irritate the eyes if applied."
What is dementia?,"'Dementia is often one of the most misunderstood conditions in medicine today. Some people believe that senility or senile dementia is an inevitable result of ''aging'', and never seek evaluation for family members who show signs of memory loss. Others believe that any evidence of forgetfulness is evidence of dementia. Neither of these conclusions is accurate.''Additionally, many questions have been raised about dementia. Does dementia differ from '""Alzheimer's""' disease or are all forms of dementia '""Alzheimer's"""" disease? If someone has memory loss associated with another condition, does that turn into Alzheimer's disease? What can be expected if someone has been diagnosed with dementia?""  "
What are the early and later signs and symptoms of dementia?,"'Early signs of dementia may include:''Many patients with '""early Alzheimer's disease""' or other types of dementia are unaware that they have any problem. As the disease progresses, behavioral changes can become evident.' Simple forgetfulness Losing items Problems performing tasks or activities that were previously done without effort. Difficulty with learning new material is frequently one of the earliest signs of dementia. Patients have difficulty performing basic tasks, such as getting dressed or using the bathroom. Some patients begin to forget pieces of information about themselves, including their address or telephone number, or even their date of birth. They may have difficulty understanding what is occurring around them. Some patients have problems remembering to eat and may develop pronounced weight loss. In the late stages of dementia, patients often cannot recognize family members and their ability to communicate effectively is markedly impaired. They are no longer able to effectively care for themselves and require assistance for all activities of daily living. Over time, patients can forget how to walk or even how to sit up."
What causes dementia?,"""Dementia is a broad term which covers many different conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, ""'frontotemporal dementia'', and other disorders.''They may repeat questions or stories regularly, or forget appointments. They may get lost in familiar environments. Personality changes, including irritability or agitation, may also occur. In some cases, people with dementia develop ''hallucinations'"" (or see things which aren't really there)."" Simple forgetfulness is not enough to lead to a diagnosis of dementia, as there needs to be evidence of problems in at least two areas of cognition (brain function) to confirm this diagnosis. Possible symptoms or signs of dementia include: Memory loss. Problems with speaking including difficulty completing sentences or finding the right word to say Difficulty completing tasks. Difficulty recognizing items or people. Showing signs of poor judgment. People with dementia may have problems preparing food. Performing household chores Paying bills."
"What are Alzheimer's, vascular, and frontotemporal dementia?","   Alzheimer’s dementia/Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cause has not yet been identified. While patients with AD have amyloid plaques (an accumulation of an abnormal protein) identified in certain areas of their brain, it is unclear if these plaques are the cause of the disease or a result of the disease. Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease begin after the age of 65, in some cases symptoms begin when someone is in their 40s or 50s. This early onset Alzheimer's disease can progress more rapidly than later onset AD. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia, and is due to multiple strokes occurring within the brain. Often, these strokes may have been unnoticed and patients may not have any associated symptoms such as weakness, visual loss, or numbness. Patients with untreated high blood pressure or heart disease may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is associated with pronounced atrophy or shrinkage of the frontal and temporal lobes in the brain. In addition to forgetfulness and word finding problems, patients may have marked personality changes, impulsivity, or poor judgment. Some patients with frontotemporal dementia can develop incoordination or stiffness of their muscles."
"What are hydrocephalus, alcoholic, Hunington's, and trauma dementia?"," Normal pressure hydrocephalus is an abnormal enlargement of the ventricles, or fluid filled spaces within the brain, that causes pressure on areas of the brain. This leads to problems with walking, memory, and ability to control urine flow (incontinence). Although this can be identified with imaging of the brain (MRI or CT scan), further testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis. If diagnosed, this condition can be treated with placement of a shunt to drain the extra fluid. Huntington’s disease causes characteristic abnormal movements, called chorea, in affected individuals. The movements are the hallmark of the diagnosis. However, in some cases, problems with memory can precede the development of the chorea by many years. Alcoholic dementia is caused when patients drink heavily and develop deficiency in one of the B vitamins. When this happens, brain cells are unable to function normally and memory loss can occur. This is called Korsakoff syndrome. Although it is most commonly seen in alcoholics, patients who are malnourished from other causes are also at risk of developing this disorder. Traumatic brain injury (concussion)/dementia) pugilistica can lead to memory problems, as we have learned in recent years. In some cases, recurrent brain injuries or repeated concussions can contribute to the underlying changes identified in Alzheimer's disease."
"What are Lewy body, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and mixed dementia"," Lewy body dementia/Lewy body disease is caused by Lewy bodies, which are abnormal clumps of certain proteins, accumulating inside of neurons. Forgetfulness and other signs of cognitive decline are the primary features of this condition, but patients can also develop prominent hallucinations which seem very real to them. Some patients with Lewy body disease develop symptoms which look like Parkinson's disease, such as tremor and slowness. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare condition where an abnormal protein leads to destruction of brain cells and dementia. While most cases occur without an underlying cause, in some patients there is a family history of this disorder. Even less often, patients might be exposed to the abnormal protein. Mad cow disease is one example of external exposure. This condition tends to progress rapidly, over only a few years, and is often associated with abnormal muscle movements. Mixed dementia refers to patients who have evidence of two (or more) types of dementia. They are often described as having mixed dementia. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are the most common causes of mixed dementia."
What are the stages of dementia?,"'The stages of dementia are loosely grouped into mild, moderate, and severe categories by some doctors. However, there is another system of staging for dementia.'""Patients may seem to fall into two different stages at the same time, depending on what symptoms they are experiencing. The different stages of dementia cannot be used to predict how rapidly someone's condition might progress and patients may remain in one stage for many years or for only a few months. Every patient has a different progression of their disease.""  Stage 1: No cognitive decline. Stage 2: Mild cognitive decline. Stage 3: Moderate cognitive decline, for example, dementia impairment like memory lapses, and losing objects daily. Stage 4: Moderately severe cognitive decline, for example, poor short-term memory, forgetting personal details, and difficulty with basic math. This is usually is the longest stage of dementia. Stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline, for example, increasing problems planning or organizing, disorientation, and may no longer be able to live alone. Stage 6: Severe cognitive decline, for example, problems recognizing friends and family members, and memory loss that worsens. Stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline. This is the final stage of dementia. Body systems decline, and communication is limited."
What are the risk factors for dementia?,"""The risk factors for developing dementia include age and family history. Age and a family history of dementia are non-modifiable risk factors. Abnormal genes which are associated with Alzheimer's disease have been identified, but are only rarely involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Conditions such as ""'high blood pressure'', high ''cholesterol'', or ''diabetes'"" increase the risks of developing either Alzheimer's disease or ""'multi-infarct dementia''. Some medications can lead to memory problems which look like dementia.'  "
How is dementia diagnosed?,"'To diagnosis dementia, testing is performed by doctors. While in-office screening assessments are sometimes enough to confirm a diagnosis, at other times a more in-depth evaluation is required. Blood testing and imaging studies are often completed to confirm that reversible conditions such as ''thyroid disease'' or certain vitamin deficiencies are not present.'  "
What is the treatment for dementia?,"""Treatment options for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are limited. While there are medications available to try to improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of these medications is limited. Physical ""'exercise'"" has been shown to be of some benefit in helping to maintain cognition. Staying engaged and participating in social events may also be of some help. To date, no treatment which can reverse the process of Alzheimer's disease has been identified."" "
What is the life expectancy for dementia? Can it be cured?,"'There is no cure for dementia.' Although Alzheimer's disease is listed as the 6th most common cause of death in the U.S.. Patients with Alzheimer's disease most commonly die due to infections caused by lack of mobility. Pneumonia, bladder infections, bedsores, and other causes can lead to more wide-spread infection and subsequent death. Patients with dementias have widely varying life expectancies, depending on the underlying cause of their dementia. Life expectancy can range from only 1 to 2 years to more than 15 years; the average duration of the disease is between 4 and 8 years after diagnosis."
How can you cope with being the caretaker of someone with dementia?,"'It is important for someone who is the primary ''caregiver'' of a patient with dementia to have a strong network of support. This is needed both to aid in caring for the patient and to give the caregiver some intermittent relief. In the early stages, many caregivers function more as a helper or guide, providing reminders for different tasks. Later in the disease, caregivers may have to supply basic care to the patient, including assistance with bathing, dressing, and going to the bathroom.''Obtaining ''power of attorney'"" status for financial and medical matters and determining when a patient is no longer able to perform certain activities, such as driving, are difficult but necessary actions. Local Alzheimer's Association chapters are often helpful in completing these tasks. Enlisting the help of a patient's physician or mandating an on-the-road driving assessment can place the responsibility of determining when a patient is no longer safe to drive on someone other than a caregiver or family member, as driving is often an action that many patients attempt to perform far past the time when it is safe to continue. There are many sources of assistance for caregivers of patients with dementia:""""Alzheimer's and Dementia Caregiver Center""""Alzheimer's Association""   Early-Stage Caregiving Middle-Stage Caregiving Late-Stage Caregiving"
Can dementia be prevented?,"'While there is no way to absolutely prevent the development of dementia, different activities have been identified which might decrease the risk. These include maintaining optimal health, including normal ''blood pressure'', normal cholesterol, and normal blood sugars. Staying physically active, avoiding tobacco use or excess alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and preventing head injuries are also recommended.' "
What are the hamstrings?,"'The hamstrings are the tendons that attach the large muscles at the back of the thigh to bone. The hamstring muscles are the large muscles that pull on these tendons. It has become common in layman\'s terminology (and by some medical personnel) to refer to the long muscles at the back of the thigh as the ""hamstrings"" or ""hamstring muscles."" Academic anatomists refer to them as the posterior thigh muscles, and more specifically as the semimembranosus, the semitendinosus, and the biceps femoris muscles. These muscles span the thigh, crossing both the hip and the knee. They originate or begin at just below the buttocks, arising from the bone on which we sit (the ischium). They connect by means of their tendons onto the upper parts of the lower leg bones (the tibia and the fibula).''The origin of the word ''hamstring'' comes from the old English ''hamm'', meaning thigh. ''String'' refers to the characteristic appearance and feel of the tendons just above the back of the knee. Although the tendons are sometimes involved in injuries, this article will refer to the ""hamstrings"" as the large muscle group at the back of the thigh because the most frequent problems involve this muscle group.' "
What is the function of the hamstrings?,"'The hamstring muscles actively bend (flex) the knee. They also act to straighten or (extend) the hip (as in the motion of moving the thigh backward). Surprisingly, these large muscles are not very active with normal ''walking'' or standing. However, they are extremely important in power activities such as ''running'', jumping, and climbing. Thus, sedentary individuals can get by with quite weak or deconditioned hamstrings, whereas athletes and very physically active individuals absolutely depend on healthy, well-conditioned hamstrings.''The power advantages of strong hamstrings have been known for a long time. In times past, a sword-wielding knight would disable an opponent by a slice across the back of the thigh. Cruel masters were known to have severed the hamstrings of domestic slaves or prisoners in order to make escape less likely. The origin of the term ''hamstrung'', meaning to have been crippled or held back, is derived from these practices.' "
"What causes hamstring injuries, and what are types of hamstring injuries?","'Hamstring injuries'' are muscle strain injuries. Hamstring injuries typically are caused by rapid acceleration activities when running or initiating running activity. Hamstring injuries are common in sports such as soccer, football, and track.''Injuries to the hamstring group of muscles can range from a minor strain to a major rupture. A minor strain is classified as a grade I tear, whereas a complete rupture, or tear, is classified as a grade III tear. Grade II tears are partial ruptures. Given the function of these muscles, it should not be surprising that grade III injuries most frequently occur in the athletically active.''Severely torn muscle causes impaired function. Grade I injuries tend to be mild in that they tend to heal fully with only minor aggravation to the injured, especially in the sedentary individual. On the other hand, in power athletes, hamstring injuries can be severe and debilitating.''Many a promising or successful athletic career has been limited or ended by such injuries. One such memorable image is that of Yankee baseball star Mickey Mantle sprawled in agony at first base, having sustained a massive grade III tear while lunging to beat out a throw.''Even common exercises, such as jumping rope, tennis, and elliptical machine walking, can lead to injury of the hamstring muscles.'  "
What are risk factors for hamstring injury?,"'Any activity that is associated with sudden acceleration when initiating or during running can lead to a hamstring injury. Common athletic activities where hamstring injuries occur include track and field events with running and sprinting, football, baseball, soccer, and tennis.' "
What are symptoms and signs of injury to the hamstring muscles?,"'Hamstring injuries usually occur with sudden lunging, running, or jumping, resulting in muscle injury. The sudden jerking pulls on the tissues of the hamstring muscle. In fact, it is commonly referred to as a ""pulled hamstring."" Oftentimes, a ""pop"" is heard or felt by the injured athlete. A variable amount of ''pain'' is experienced immediately. The athlete is usually unable to continue and oftentimes cannot even stand.''Examination of the individual with a hamstring injury reveals spasm, tightness, and tenderness. With more severe injury, swelling and a black and blue or bruised appearance will follow. In some cases, a palpable defect (detectable by touching) will be present in the muscle. Tears and ''strains'' most often occur at the middle of the back of the thigh where the muscle joins its tendon or at the origin of the hamstring at the base of the buttocks (at the ischium).'  "
What specialties of doctors treat hamstring injuries?,"'Hamstring injuries are treated by primary care physicians, including family medicine and general-medicine doctors, as well as internists. Doctors who specialize in athletic injury evaluation and treatment are orthopedic surgeons. Physiatrists also can care for hamstring injuries. Ancillary caregivers who are frequently involved in the treatment of hamstring injuries include physical therapists and ''massage'' therapists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hamstring injuries?,"'Injury to the hamstring muscle is diagnosed by the rapid onset of intense ''pain'' in the back of the mid-thigh during running or similar activity. Athletes will often instantly grab in pain at the back of the thigh, being unable to walk without ''limping''. There is often focal tenderness where there is pain that is aggravated by stretching the affected thigh. In most patients, imaging is not necessary. However, if imaging is done to more completely view the muscle, tendon, or bone involvement with the injury, ''MRI'' gives the best views, although CT and ''ultrasound'' studies have also been used.'  "
What are home remedies for hamstring injury?,"'The goal of treatment is to restore muscle function and prevent ''scar'' formation. Initially, treatment consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Rest refers to avoidance of offending activities and oftentimes includes immobilization. In severe cases, crutches or splinting may be necessary. Ice, compression, and elevation all help in controlling pain and swelling. A short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'"", Children's Advil/""'Motrin'', Medipren, Motrin, ''Nuprin'', PediaCare ''Fever'', and others), or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'', ''Anaprox'', ''Naprelan'', ''Naprosyn''), may be helpful (avoid aspirin use in children).' "
What is the treatment for hamstring injuries?,"'Most hamstring injuries heal without surgery. Rarely, when there is a complete rupture at the ischium, or when a significant piece of ischial bone is jerked away, surgery is necessary. Essentially, all other grade I-III tears are best treated without surgery.''As soon as pain permits, it is important to begin a program of stretching and range-of-motion rehabilitation exercises because prolonged immobilization and inactivity results in muscle shrinkage (atrophy) and ''scar tissue'' (fibrosis). Excessive scar tissue is incompatible with healthy muscle function. Atrophy and fibrosis are best avoided or reduced by a program of motion and stretching implemented early in the rehabilitation process.''It should be emphasized that an early rehabilitation program does not mean a quick return to the desired usual activity. Given the type of individual that usually sustains a significant hamstring injury, it is usually a difficult task to keep athletic patients off the playing field. Reinjury is extremely common and is often due to avoidable premature return to sport. Reinjury not only prolongs recovery, it also increases the risk of permanent damage. People with these injuries should be informed early in the rehabilitation program about the risks of reinjury.''After pain and swelling have been controlled and acceptable range of motion and flexibility has been attained, a gradual strengthening program should follow. After adequate strength has returned, then a gradual return to the desired activity is attempted. Full return is usually possible only after maximal flexibility and optimal strength have been obtained. Depending on the severity of injury, the entire rehabilitative process may take several months. Physical therapists can assist in guiding the ''exercise'' program.' "
Is it possible to prevent a hamstring injury?,"'There is no foolproof way to completely avoid hamstring injuries. However, the risks can be minimized by paying attention to the principles of muscle strength and flexibility. Individual flexibility should be maximized by a regular stretching program as well as a period of warm-up and stretching before the intended athletic activity.''Optimal individual hamstring strength is at least half of the strength of the ''quadriceps'' muscle (muscle of the front of the thigh). Also, there should be minimal imbalance in strength between the right and left legs (the injured hamstrings should be about 90% as strong as the uninjured hamstrings). If necessary, a weight-training program should be instituted to optimally achieve these goals.''A well-balanced ''diet'' and appropriate fluid intake are essential to avoid ''electrolyte'' imbalance and ''dehydration''. ''Dehydration'' can lead to muscle cramping, thereby increasing the chance of muscle injury. Excessive body weight increases the risk of muscle injuries in the lower extremities. Some experts have also advocated the use of nutritional ''supplements'', such as antioxidants. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts at ''prevention'' and treatment, hamstring injuries will continue to be a common problem for high-performance athletes, as well as ""weekend warriors.""'  "
What is the prognosis for hamstring injuries?,"'The outlook is generally good, but can require a period of rest by avoiding running and athletic competition. The length required for recovery varies depending on the severity of the muscle injury.' "

What is pulmonary edema?,"'Edema, in general, means swelling. This typically occurs when fluid from inside blood vessels seeps outside the blood vessel into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. This can happen either because of too much pressure in the blood vessels or not enough proteins in the bloodstream to hold on to the fluid in the plasma (the part of the blood that does not contain any blood cells).''Pulmonary edema is the term used when edema happens in the lungs. The immediate area outside of the small blood vessels in the lungs is occupied by very tiny air sacs called the alveoli. This is where oxygen from the air is picked up by the blood passing by, and carbon dioxide in the blood is passed into the alveoli to be exhaled out. Alveoli normally have a thin wall that allows for this air exchange, and fluids are usually kept out of the alveoli unless these walls lose their integrity.''Pulmonary edema occurs when the alveoli fill up with excess fluid seeped out of the blood vessels in the lung instead of air. This can cause problems with the exchange of ''gas'' (oxygen and carbon dioxide), resulting in breathing difficulty and poor oxygenation of blood. Sometimes, this can be referred to as ""water in the lungs"" when describing the condition to patients.''Pulmonary edema can be caused by many different factors. It can be related to ''heart failure'', called cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or related to other causes, referred to as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.'  "
What are the symptoms of pulmonary edema?,"'The most common symptom of pulmonary edema is ''shortness of breath'' or breathlessness. This may be of gradual onset if the process slowly develops, or it can have a sudden onset in the case of acute pulmonary edema.''Other common symptoms may include easy ''fatigue'', more rapidly developing shortness of breath than normal with usual activity (dyspnea on exertion), rapid breathing (tachypnea), ''dizziness'', or ''weakness''.''Low blood oxygen level (''hypoxia'') may be detected in patients with pulmonary edema. Furthermore, upon examination of the lungs with a stethoscope, the doctor may listen for abnormal lung sounds, such as rales or crackles (discontinuous short bubbling sounds corresponding to the splashing of the fluid in the alveoli during breathing).'  "
What are the risk factors for pulmonary edema?,"""The risk factors for pulmonary edema are essentially the underlying causes of the condition. There isn't any specific risk factor for pulmonary edema other than risk factors for the causative conditions."" "
What causes pulmonary edema?,"'As mentioned earlier, pulmonary edema can be broadly divided into cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic causes. Some of the common causes are listed below.''Cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema results from high pressure in the blood vessels of the lung due to poor ''heart function''. ''Congestive heart failure'' due to poor ''heart'' pumping function (arising from various causes such as arrhythmias and diseases or weakness of the heart muscle), ''heart attacks'', or abnormal heart valves can lead to accumulation of more than the usual amount of blood in the blood vessels of the lungs. This can, in turn, cause the fluid from the blood vessels to be pushed out to the alveoli as the pressure builds up.''Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be commonly caused by the following:'   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially serious condition caused by severe infections, trauma, lung injury, inhalation of toxins, lung infections, cocaine smoking, or radiation to the lungs. In ARDS, the integrity of the alveoli become compromised as a result of underlying inflammatory response, and this leads to leaky alveoli that can fill up with fluid from the blood vessels. Kidney failure and inability to excrete fluid from the body can cause fluid build-up in the blood vessels, resulting in pulmonary edema. In people with advanced kidney disease, dialysis may be necessary to remove the excess body fluid. High altitude pulmonary edema, which can happen due to rapid ascent to high altitudes of more than 10,000 feet. Brain trauma, bleeding in the brain (intracranial hemorrhage), severe seizures, or brain surgery can sometimes result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing neurogenic pulmonary edema. A rapidly expanding lung can sometimes cause re-expansion pulmonary edema. This may happen in cases when the lung collapses (pneumothorax) or a large amount of fluid around the lung (pleural effusion) is removed, resulting in rapid expansion of the lung. This can result in pulmonary edema on the affected side only (unilateral pulmonary edema). Rarely, an overdose on heroin or methadone can lead to pulmonary edema. Aspirin overdose or chronic high dose use of aspirin can lead to aspirin intoxication, especially in the elderly, which may cause pulmonary edema. Other more rare causes of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may include pulmonary embolism (blood clot which has traveled to the lungs), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), some viral infections, or eclampsia in pregnant women."
What are the complications of pulmonary edema?,"'Most complications of pulmonary edema may arise from the complications associated with the underlying cause. More specifically, pulmonary edema can cause severely compromised oxygenation of the blood by the lungs. This poor oxygenation (hypoxia) can potentially lead to diminished oxygen delivery to different body organs, such as the brain.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose pulmonary edema?,"'Pulmonary edema is typically diagnosed by a ''chest X-ray''. A normal chest radiograph (X-ray) consists of a central white area pertaining to the heart and its main blood vessels plus the bones of the vertebral column, with the lung fields showing as darker fields on either side, enclosed by the bony structures of the chest wall.''A typical chest X-ray with pulmonary edema may show a more white appearance over both lung fields than usual. More severe cases of pulmonary edema can demonstrate significant opacification (whitening) over the lungs with minimal visualization of the normal lung fields. This whitening represents filling of the alveoli as a result of pulmonary edema, but it may give minimal information about the possible underlying cause.'""To identify the cause of pulmonary edema, a thorough assessment of the patient's clinical picture is essential. A careful medical history and physical examination often provide invaluable information regarding the cause.""'Other diagnostics tools used in assessing the underlying cause of pulmonary edema include the measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP. This is a protein marker (a hormone) that will rise in the blood due to the stretch of the chambers of the heart. Elevation of the BNP nanogram (one billionth of a gram) per liter greater than a few hundred (300 or more) is highly suggestive of cardiac pulmonary edema. On the other hand, values less than 100 essentially rule out heart failure as the cause.''More invasive methods are occasionally necessary to distinguish between cardiac and noncardiac pulmonary edema in more complicated and critical situations. A pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz) is a thin, long tube (catheter) inserted into the large veins of the chest or the neck and advanced through the right-sided chambers of the heart and lodged into the pulmonary capillaries (small branches of the blood vessels of the lungs). This device has the capability of directly measuring the pressure in the pulmonary vessels, called the pulmonary artery wedge pressure.''A Swan-Ganz catheter placement and data interpretation is done only in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.'   A wedge pressure of 18 mmHg or higher is consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, whereas a wedge pressure of less than 18 mmHg usually favors a non-cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema."
What is the treatment for pulmonary edema?,"'The treatment of pulmonary edema largely depends on its cause and severity.''Most cases of cardiac pulmonary edema are treated by using diuretics (water pills) along with other medications for heart failure. In some situations, appropriate treatment can be achieved as an outpatient by taking oral medications. If the pulmonary edema is more severe or it is not responsive to oral medications, then hospitalization and the use of intravenous diuretic medications may be necessary.''The treatment for noncardiac causes of pulmonary edema varies depending on the cause. For example, severe infection (''sepsis'') is treated with antibiotics and other supportive measures, or ''kidney failure'' needs to be properly evaluated and managed.''Oxygen supplementation is necessary if the measured oxygen level in the blood is too low. In serious conditions, such as ARDS, placing a patient on a mechanical breathing machine is necessary to support their breathing while other measures are taken to treat pulmonary edema and its underlying cause.'  "
When should I seek medical care for pulmonary edema?,"'Medical attention should be sought for anyone who is diagnosed with pulmonary edema of any cause. Many causes of pulmonary edema require hospitalization, especially if they are caused acutely. In some cases of chronic (long term) pulmonary edema, for example, with congestive heart failure, routine follow-up visits with the treating doctor may be recommended.''Most cases of pulmonary edema are treated by internal medicine doctors (internists), heart specialists (cardiologists), or lung doctors (pulmonologists).' "
Is it possible to prevent pulmonary edema?,"'In terms of preventive measures, depending on the cause of pulmonary edema, some steps can be taken. Long-term ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' and ''heart attacks'', slow elevation to high altitudes, or avoidance of drug overdose can be considered preventive.''On the other hand, some causes may not completely avoidable or preventable, such as ARDS due to an overwhelming infection or a trauma.' "
Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) overview,"   Pulmonary embolism (PE) describes a blockage of one of the pulmonary arteries by a blood clot that forms elsewhere in the body and travels to the lung. The blood clot (thrombus) usually forms in a vein deep in an arm or leg (DVT=deep vein thrombosis), and breaks off, traveling into and through the heart into the lung where it gets trapped, blocking blood supply to portions of the lung. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) describes the medical condition that includes both PE and DVT. Classic symptoms of pulmonary embolism may include:pleuritic chest pain,shortness of breath,rapid heart rate, andanxiety. pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and anxiety. The condition can also cause less obvious symptoms including anxiety, cough, bloody sputum, abdominal pain, or syncope (passing out). Some risk factors for VTE include:prolonged immobilization,surgery or trauma,cancer,pregnancy,oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy,smoking, andhypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). prolonged immobilization, surgery or trauma, cancer, pregnancy, oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy, smoking, and hypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). Pulmonary embolism may cause sudden death. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is sometimes difficult to make and may be missed. It is a diagnosis that needs to be considered in everyone complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis is most often confirmed by lung CT scan or pulmonary angiography. Anticoagulation (blood thinning) is the treatment for pulmonary embolism. Depending upon the situation, anticoagulation may continue for 3 to 6 months or it may last a lifetime. The major complication of anticoagulation is bleeding."
What is a pulmonary embolism? What does it look like (picture)?,"'The ''lungs'' are responsible for taking oxygen from the air and delivering it to the body. They also take carbon dioxide (a waste product of metabolism) from the blood stream and exhale it, removing it from the body.''The exchange of the air between the lungs and blood are through the arterial and venous system. Both arteries and veins carry and move blood throughout the body, but the process for each is very different.''Arteries carry blood away from the heart, and veins return blood. Every time the heart pumps, it sends blood both to the lungs and the rest of the body.''The circulation pathway is as follows:'""If a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the body's deep veins (""'deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT''), it has the potential to break off and travel (embolize) back to the heart and into one of the pulmonary arteries where it can become stuck.''A pulmonary embolus blocks blood flow and prevents functioning of that part of the lung. Not only does it prevent the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, but it also decreases blood supply to the lung tissue itself, potentially causing part of the lung tissue to die (infarct=tissue death).''A pulmonary embolus is one of the life-threatening causes of chest ''pain'' that should always be considered when patients complain of chest ''pain'' and shortness of breath to their health care professionals.''There are special types of pulmonary embolus that are not due to ''blood clots'', but instead are due to other body materials. These are rare occurrences and include:''The signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are caused by decreased lung function and the inability of the lung to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body.' The pulmonary arteries and their branches send blood from the heart to the lungs. Oxygen from the air is loaded onto hemoglobin in the red blood cells and then travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart then pumps that oxygen-rich blood through the aorta and its branches to all the organs and tissues in the rest of the body, including the brain, the abdomen, and the arms and legs. After the hemoglobin delivers the oxygen into the tissues, it collects carbon dioxide, the waste product of metabolism. The carbon dioxide-laden blood then returns through veins back to the heart. The heart pumps this blood through the pulmonary arteries back to the lung. There, the carbon dioxide is returned to exhaled air and a new cargo of oxygen is uploaded to begin the circulation cycle again. fat emboli from the interior of a large bone like a femur (thigh bone), which can occur because of a fracture or as a complication of surgery, an amniotic fluid embolus in pregnancy, tumor tissue from cancer, air embolus, usually a complication of a medical procedure such as neurosurgery, dye injection, or central intravenous line placement."
What are the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism?,"'The most common symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are the acute onset of:''Vital signs (''blood pressure'', heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) may be normal or abnormal, depending upon the size of the embolus and how much lung tissue is affected. The larger the clot burden or load, the less stable the vital signs.''Abnormal vital signs may include:''The condition progresses as follows:''Sudden death is the initial sign of the condition in up to 25% of cases. The person collapses, stops breathing, and his or her heart stops beating (''cardiac arrest'') without prior symptoms. Pulmonary embolus is the second leading cause of sudden death, behind ''coronary artery disease''.'   Chest pain: The pain is often described as pleuritic, a sharp pain that worsens when taking a deep breath. Shortness of breath: The person may have difficulty catching his or her breath at rest, and the shortness of breath often worsens with activity. Hypoxia or hypoxemia: decreased oxygen concentration in the blood. (hypo=less + ox=oxygen + ia or emia= blood). Tachycardia: elevated heart rate (tachy=fast + cardia=heart); Tachypnea: elevated respiratory (breathing) rate.(tachy=fast + pnea= breathing); Hypotension: decreased blood pressure (hypo=low + tension=blood pressure); Hypoxia: decreased SaO2. Oxygen saturation described how many hemoglobin molecules are carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen level is usually greater than 92%-93%. The heart rate and respiratory rate may elevate as the body tries to compensate for the decreased oxygen transfer capabilities in the lung. This allows the oxygen that is available to be circulated more quickly, supplying the body's organ and tissue needs as best as possible. This may lead to anxiety, weakness and lightheadedness as the body's organs are deprived of the necessary oxygen to function. If the clot burden is large enough, it may make it harder for the heart to pump blood through the blocked pulmonary arteries. This increases the work that the heart has to do, raising pressures inside the heart and straining the heart muscle itself."
What are the causes and risk factors for pulmonary embolism?,"'Pulmonary embolus is the end result of a ''deep vein thrombosis'' or blood clot elsewhere in the body. Most commonly, the DVT begins in the leg and lower abdomen (pelvis) or arm.'""The risk factors for a pulmonary embolism are the same risks for developing deep vein thrombosis. These are referred to as Virchow's triad and include:""'Examples of these include:''Prolonged immobilization''Increased blood clotting potential''Damage to vessel wall'   prolonged immobilization or alterations in normal blood flow (stasis), increased clotting potential of the blood (hypercoagulability), damage to the walls of the veins. Extended travel (sitting in a car, airplane, train) Hospitalization or prolonged bed rest Surgery Medicationsbirth control pillsestrogen supplementationphenothiazines birth control pills estrogen supplementation phenothiazines Smoking Genetic predisposition. Examples include:Factor V Leiden deficiencyMHFTHR mutationProtein C or Protein S deficienciesantithrombin III deficiencyHomocystinemiaHomocystinuriaHyperlipidemia Factor V Leiden deficiency MHFTHR mutation Protein C or Protein S deficiencies antithrombin III deficiency Homocystinemia Homocystinuria Hyperlipidemia Blood disordersPolycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia)ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Polycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia) increased number of red blood cells (the opposite of anemia) ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Elevated platelet count Cancer Pregnancy, including the postpartum period up to 6 to 8 weeks after delivery Prior deep venous thrombosis Trauma to the lower leg with or without surgery or casting Venography Pacemaker insertion IV drug abuse"
What tests diagnose pulmonary embolism?,"'The health care professional should keep a high level of suspicion that a pulmonary embolus may be the cause of chest pain or shortness of breath. The first step in the diagnosis is taking a history of the chest pain, including its characteristics, its onset, and any associated symptoms that may direct the diagnosis to pulmonary embolism. The provider may also ask questions about risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.''Physical examination will concentrate initially on the heart and lungs, since chest pain and shortness of breath may also be the major complaints for ''heart attack'', ''pneumonia'', ''pneumothorax'' (collapsed lung), dissection of an ''aortic aneurysm'', among other conditions.''In pulmonary embolism, the chest examination is often normal, but if there is some associated inflammation on the surface of the lung (the pleura), a rub may be heard (pleura inflammation may cause friction, which can be heard with a stethoscope).''The physical examination may also include examining the arms and legs, looking for signs of a DVT, including warmth, redness, tenderness, and swelling.''People with a pulmonary embolus may have no physical findings and have a normal physical exam.'  "
PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolus,"'It is important to be able to determine the risk for pulmonary embolus to decide whether testing is needed to look for a PE.''One risk stratification tool is the PERC rule. If the patient has no risk factors for PE and normal vital signs, the potential for pulmonary embolism is low (less than 2%). No further testing may be necessary, depending upon the situation.''A negative PERC test requires that NO is the answer to the following statements:''If the answer is YES to any of these questions, then the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus still needs to be considered.' Age older than 50 Heart rate faster than 100 SaO2 on room air less than 95% Prior DVT or PE Trauma or surgery within the last 4 weeks Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Hormone use Unilateral leg swelling (only one leg involved)"
"Basic testing (CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine blood test, chest X-ray, EKG)","'Basic testing in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism may include:''Chest X-ray is often normal in pulmonary embolism.''EKG may be normal, but may also show indirect signs of PE. These include tachycardia (heart rate >100), and changes associated with ''right ventricle'' strain.' CBC (complete blood count), Electrolytes, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), Creatinine blood test (to assess kidney function; see below), INR, PTT (to measure blood clotting capabilities), Chest X-ray, and Electrocardiogram (Electrocardiography; EKG, ECG)."
D-dimer blood test,"'If the suspicion for pulmonary embolism is low, a D-dimer blood test can be used for reassurance that a blood clot may not be present. The D-dimer blood test measures one of the breakdown products of a blood clot. If this test is normal, then the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism is very low. Unfortunately, this test is not specific for blood clots in the lung. It can be positive for a variety of reasons including pregnancy, injury, recent surgery, cancer, or infection.''D-dimer is not helpful if the potential risk for a blood clot is high.''The purpose for the PERC rule and D-dimer test is to minimize the need for imaging studies and decrease ''radiation'' exposure risk.' "
CT scan,"'CT scan (''computerized tomography'') of the chest is usually the imaging test of first choice to look for pulmonary embolus. Dye is injected into a vein in the upper arm. This allows the pulmonary arteries to be outlined looking for blood clots. Care needs to be taken with people who have dye ''allergies'', have kidney issues or who are in their ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.' "
Pulmonary angiogram,"'Historically, the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was a pulmonary ''angiogram'', in which a catheter was threaded into the pulmonary arteries, usually from veins in the groin or wrist. Dye was injected into the pulmonary arteries and could identify whether blood clots were present. This is an invasive test and requires a skilled radiologist to insert the catheter.''CT scan is more commonly used today, and pulmonary angiography is most often performed in unusual circumstances.' "
Ventilation-perfusion scans,"'Ventilation-perfusion scans (V/Q scans) are another less commonly used test in people who cannot undergo a chest CT scan to make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.''The scan uses inhaled ''gas'' (V) and injected dye (Q) to compare areas of lung where air can enter with those areas of lung that are getting blood supply. If there is a mismatch, then there is a possibility that a blood clot exists.''V/Q scans take hours to perform and are read by a radiologist as low, medium, and high probability that a blood clot is present. A low probability result means that there is still a 5%-15% change that a PE exists. For that reason, V/Q scans are not often performed.' "
Venous Doppler ultrasound,"'Instead of imaging the lung, ''ultrasound'' of the legs (or arms, if clinically appropriate) may be used to look for blood clots in a patient suspected of having a pulmonary embolus. If a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) exists, it can be inferred that someone complaining of chest pain and/or shortness of breath may be suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The initial treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus may be similar, depending upon the clinical situation.'  "
Echocardiography,'Echocardiography'' or ''ultrasound of the heart'' may be helpful looking for right heart strain as a complication of a pulmonary embolus.' 
What is the treatment for pulmonary embolism?,"'When patients with a PE are admitted to the hospital, it is because they are unstable with abnormal vital signs, or there is concern that they will become unstable. The initial treatment of choice is ''unfractionated ''heparin'', an injectable blood thinner that is continuously given intravenously.''If vital signs are not stable, other alternative treatments may be considered based on the clinical situation. Complications can include ''shock'' with ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure''), ''confusion'', ''coma'', or ''heart failure''.''Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or ''alteplase'' is an injectable clot-busting drug.''Thrombolytic therapy''Thrombectomy, embolectomy''Once vital signs are stable, anticoagulation with oral medication will follow the intravenous heparin or tPA, and these will be maintained after discharge to home.'   The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The treatment for PE is anticoagulation. Once the diagnosis of PE is made, it is important to know the severity of the illness and whether the patient needs to be hospitalized or whether treatment can occur at home. The Pulmonary Embolus Severity Index (PESI) can help risk stratify who is stable and who may potentially be unstable. It takes the following factors into account:AgeSexHistory of cancer, heart disease, lung diseaseVital signsMental status Age Sex History of cancer, heart disease, lung disease Vital signs Mental status All patients with abnormal vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) need to be admitted to the hospital. Those who have unstable social situations, have difficulty obtaining medication or have difficulty understanding their medication may require observation prior to being discharged to home. Peripheral thrombolysis (thrombo= clot + lysis= dissolve) is the use of a clot-busting drug injected into a vein, with the expectation that it will “dissolve” the blood clot in the pulmonary artery. Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is the use of a catheter threaded into the pulmonary artery where the clot is lodged and the clot-busting drug is injected directly into it. A catheter is inserted into the pulmonary artery and the clot is sucked out."
Anticoagulation,"'Anticoagulation, or blood thinning, is the treatment of choice for both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.''Anticoagulation prevents further blood clot formation and prevents embolization of a clot to the lung from existing clots. Under normal conditions, the body will activate a system that will break down blood clots within 4 to 6 weeks.''The American College of Chest Physicians has published guidelines regarding the choice of medications to anticoagulate a patient with VTE. The recommendations were based on review of multiple ''clinical trials'' and meta-analyses (statistical evaluation) in the medical literature.''Apixaban and rivaroxiban are oral medications that have a relatively rapid onset of action and become effective within 3 to 4 days.''Edoxiban and dabigatran take long to become effective and, therefore, there is a two-step process in their use. Either intravenous heparin or subcutaneous enoxaparin need to be used until the oral medications become effective.''Coumadin'' (''warfarin'') has historically been the medication of choice for the treatment of VTE. It takes many days to reach its therapeutic range in the body and, therefore, it too requires the use of heparin or enoxaparin until the medicine is effective.''Certain clinical situations also affect the choice of anticoagulation. Pregnancy, those who are ''breastfeeding'', the presence of ''liver'' or ''kidney failure'', and the presence of anti-phospholipid syndrome may require specific anticoagulation medications. The health care professional needs to match the clinical situation with the appropriate medication.''The dosing of Coumadin is monitored by blood test. INR (international normalized ratio) is used to guide the amount of Coumadin that is taken each day to keep the blood appropriately thinned. Certain foods and medications can interact with Coumadin and affect the dosing.''DOACs do not need blood tests to monitor their effectiveness or dosing. There are ''drug interactions'' that need to be considered when they are prescribed.' In patients with VTE and no cancer, the drug of choice is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as:apixaban (Eliquis)rivaroxiban (Xarelto)edoxiban (Sayvessa)dabigatran (Pradaxa) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxiban (Xarelto) edoxiban (Sayvessa) dabigatran (Pradaxa) In patients with VTE and active cancer, the drug of choice is enoxaparin (Lovenox).The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin."
Duration of treatment,"'People usually take anticoagulation medications for a minimum of 3 to 6 months. At that time, the decision will be made based upon their risk of developing recurrent clots as to whether they should continue with long-term therapy.''Risk stratification may include whether the blood clot was provoked or unprovoked. An example of a provoked blood clot would be a patient who broke his or her leg, was placed in a cast, and was sedentary. Those who have VTE often undergo hypercoagulable evaluations looking for genetic or familial causes of blood clots.''If the health care professional, in consultation with the patient (shared decision-making), decides that lifelong therapy is required, that decision should be reviewed every year to determine if the risk of clotting still exists and whether the risk of clotting is greater than the risk of bleeding.'  "
Can pulmonary embolism cause death?,"'Patient survival depends upon:''There are more than 900,000 cases of DVT and PE in the United States, and 60,000-100,000 people die each year from the condition. In addition, 25% of cases of PE cause sudden death, and 10%-30% of patients with PE will die within the first month of diagnosis.' the underlying health of the patient, the clot burden of the pulmonary embolus, the effect it has on the heart and its ability to pump blood to the organs of the body, vital sign stability, the cause of the pulmonary embolus, and the ability for the diagnosis to be made and early initiation of treatment."
Can pulmonary embolism be prevented?,"'Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The embolism cannot occur without the initial DVT.' In the hospital setting, the nursing staff works hard to minimize the potential for clot formation in immobilized patients.Compression stockings are routinely used.Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier.Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. Compression stockings are routinely used. Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier. Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. DVT in the legs may require the placement of vena cava filters to prevent clots in the legs from embolizing to the lung. The filter sits in the large vein that leads from the legs to the heart. Those who have had hip or knee replacements may be prescribed DOACs to prevent DVTs. For long travel, getting up and walking or stretching every couple hours may prevent clot formation. Compression stockings may be helpful in preventing recurrent DVT in people with a previous history of a clot. Those on hormone therapy, including birth control pills, should be counseled regarding the risk of DVT. Smoking cessation reduces risk of clot. In those who are overweight, weight loss may decrease the risk of clot formation."
What is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of progressive fibrosis that causes interstitial ''pneumonia'', usually in older adults and is limited to the ''lungs''. Fibrotic (''scar''-like) tissue develops in the airways of the lungs, making it difficult for the body to get the oxygen it needs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis differs from pulmonary fibrosis in that the cause is unknown whereas there are known causes of pulmonary fibrosis. Though not very common, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be debilitating, incurable, and terminal, by many health-care professionals and researchers.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are not specific, and are similar to many other types of pulmonary cardiac diseases. The majority of people with the disease have about a 6-month or more history of ''shortness of breath'' and/or nonproductive ''cough''. About 5% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis do not have symptoms, and the disease is diagnosed when he or she is being examined for other medical problems.''The signs and symptoms that may occur in some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are:'   Six months or greater history of shortness of breath and/or cough Fatigue Mild fevers Weight loss Joint discomfort Muscle pain Clubbing or enlargement of fingers Ankle swelling Heart murmur (tricuspid regurgitation)"
What causes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Inclusion of the word ""idiopathic"" means that this type of fibrosis has an unknown cause. Current hypotheses include exposure to some type of agent (for example, environmental dust, viral infection, reflux, aspiration of gastrointestinal contents, and others) that leads to the alveolar damage in the lungs. Researchers further hypothesize that in attempt to repair the alveolar damage, fibrosis and lung scarring occur to produce eventually clinical pulmonary fibrosis.' "
What are the stages of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Staging systems for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may help health-care professionals and researchers to better define the medical condition of their patients. However, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, staging systems are constantly being redefined. For example, the first staging systems traditionally considered the disease as mild, moderate, or severe while others considered stages as early or advanced. The stages are relatively arbitrary and loosely based on pulmonary function tests. Unfortunately, there are no standardized definitions for mild, moderate, and severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Though arbitrary, these staging systems give health-care professionals a framework to diagnose and treat patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.''For example, some doctors consider treatment with ''pirfenidone'' for mild to moderate disease, and lung transplantation for severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There are researchers that have developed novel idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis staging systems based on other criteria such as age, hospitalization, baseline lung function, and a 24-week change in function, while other researchers choose other parameters such as various physiological lung measurements. The patient and their physician(s) can discuss which staging system they choose to utilize.' "
Is there a test to diagnosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is somewhat difficult. It is a diagnosis of exclusion of other known causes of ''interstitial lung disease'' including environmental and drug exposures. Currently, there are no laboratory studies that can ultimately diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, up to 30% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may have positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and/or ''rheumatoid factor''.''High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is somewhat more specific and sensitive for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnoses although not definitive, the same is true for pulmonary function tests. However, repeated pulmonary function tests that show declines over six months, when taken into account with other non-specific findings, add to the possible diagnosis. However, a pattern of usual interstitial ''pneumonia'' (UIP) on HRCT requires four features for diagnosis of interstitial ''pneumonia'':''Bronchoscopy'' and surgical lung biopsy are also used to help distinguish between UIP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Consequently, the newest diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis requires the following:' Subplural, basal predominance of ground glass opacity Reticular abnormalities Honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis Absence of features listed as inconsistent with UIP Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and/or drug toxicities) The presence of a UIP pattern, described above, on HRCT in patients not subjected to surgical biopsy Specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy patterns in patients subjected to surgical lung biopsy"
Treatment guidelines for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'The treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis depends upon the stage of the disease, and usually begins with medical treatment, supportive measures, and possibly surgical transplantation of the lungs. Often, during the mild to moderate disease medical care is initiated. However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sometimes progresses rapidly, so if idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed, a transplant surgeon should be consulted early as the person with IPF may eventually require lung transplant.''Guidelines on the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have been published by several institutions including the American, European, Japanese, Latin American thoracic societies and/or associations. The following is an abbreviated summary of these guidelines:''Patients should discuss with their doctors on how this progressive disease is best treated on an individual basis.'  They conditionally recommend the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib, both approved by the FDA in 2014. They do not conditionally recommend the use of imatinib (Gleevec), warfarin (Warfarin, Jantoven), combination prednisone with N-acetylcysteine, and several other drugs. They conditionally recommend anti-acid medications even in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients without symptoms of reflux. Encourage the patient to quit any smoking. Encourage vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal infections. They suggest patients with hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood, for example, pulse oximetry measured less than 88%) use oxygen therapies to maintain a saturation at least 90% during all activities, including sleeping."
Lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'Lung transplantation is considered when the patient develops severe stage (also termed end stage) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lung transplantation does show a survival benefit over medical therapy. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has now replaced ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') as the most common reason for lung transplantation in the US.''Any patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should be referred to a transplant surgeon to determine early on if the patient may meet criteria for a lung transplant. Some people may qualify for a single or a double lung transplant. Reported five-year survival rates for lung transplantation are about 50% to 56%.''Criteria for a transplant vary somewhat so it is important to have the patient and the medical team (primary care physician, ''pulmonologist'', and transplant surgeon) all agree on the potential criteria for the individual patient.' "
"What is the life expectancy and prognosis for a person with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?","'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis. The mean survival time or ""life expectancy"" is about 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Most commonly, the person experiences an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and then dies because of the disease. Individuals with IPF who undergo lung transplant have a mortality rate of about 50% to 56% after five years so the transplant may increase the life expectancy in some people with the disease.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Although primary care physicians help manage patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usually a pulmonologist (a lung specialist) is consulted during the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Some doctors suggest a lung transplant surgeon be consulted when the patient is diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis unless there are contraindications (Lung transplant may be more harmful to some people.) for transplantation.''Because of the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a ''gastroenterologist'' may be consulted.' "
Can idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis be prevented?,"'Because idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is ""idiopathic,"" ''prevention'' is difficult. However, many health-care professionals and researchers theorize that the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be reduced in some people if they ''quit smoking'', and reduce or eliminate their exposure to toxins or fumes that have the potential to damage the lungs.' "
Support for families and friends,"'There are support groups for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and their families, for example, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (''www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org'') and the American Lung Association (''www.lung.org'').' "
What is pulmonary fibrosis?,"'""Fibrosis"" is a term used to refer to scarring, so pulmonary fibrosis means scarring throughout the lungs. '  "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with pulmonary fibrosis?,'The prognosis of this disease is poor.  The survival of patients with pulmonary fibrosis is less than 5 years.  It is best to become involved with an academic center in the area where research on interstitial lung diseases is studied in order to receive the latest treatments.  These centers often are linked with a lung transplant program. ''Clinical trials'' are the best way of treating this disease at this time. ' 
What is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The definition of ""idiopathic"" is ""of unknown cause;"" thus idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is fibrosis (scarring) of the lungs without a known cause.''IPF mostly affects middle-aged and older adults, and there is no cure. The progress of the disease varies from person to person, but often people diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis live about three to five years following their diagnosis.''While the cause of IPF is unknown, it is thought that genetics may be a factor. When more than one member of a family has IPF, the disease is referred to as familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ' "
What causes pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many conditions including: ''In a condition known as ''hypersensitivity pneumonitis'', fibrosis of the lung can develop following a heightened immune reaction to inhaled organic dusts or occupational chemicals. This condition most often results from inhaling dust contaminated with bacterial, fungal, or animal products. ''In some people, chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis develop without an identifiable cause. Most of these people have a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that does not respond to medical therapy, while some of the other types of fibrosis, such as nonspecific ''interstitial pneumonitis'' (NSIP), may respond to immune suppressive therapy. ''Synonyms (other names) for various types of pulmonary fibrosis that have been used in the past include chronic interstitial pneumonitis, Hamman-Rich syndrome, and diffuse fibrosing alveolitis.

What are signs and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Signs and symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis include:''Symptoms vary depending on the cause of pulmonary fibrosis. The severity of symptoms and the progression (worsening) of symptoms over time can vary.'   Shortness of breath (dyspnea), including shortness of breath with everyday activities Coughing (chronic, dry, hacking cough) Diminished exercise tolerance Fast, shallow breathing Fatigue/tiredness Weakness Chest discomfort Muscle and joint aches Loss of appetite Unexplained/unintended weight loss ""Clubbing"" of the tips of the fingers and toes (thickening of flesh under the nails, causing a widening and rounding appearance"

	 Often, slow and insidious onset of shortness of breath can set in.   With time, shortness of breath (dyspnea) worsens. Dyspnea initially occurs only with activity and is often attributed to aging.  
Over time, the dyspnea occurs with little or no activity. Eventually, the 
shortness of breath becomes disabling, limiting all activity and even occurring 
while sitting still.  In rarer cases, the fibrosis can be rapidly progressive, 
with shortness of breath (dyspnea and disability occurring in weeks to months from the onset of the disease.  This form of pulmonary fibrosis has been referred to as Hamman-Rich syndrome.

What are the stages of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been loosely staged and categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, or early versus advanced. The staging is usually based on pulmonary function tests, although these stages are considered arbitrary.''There are some newer proposed staging systems:''Taking these factors into account gives a score, which helps predict the expected 1-year probability of death.' Mortality risk scoring system: This is based on four predictorsage,recent respiratory hospitalization,baseline forced vital capacity (FVC, a measure of lung function), and24-week change in FVC. age, recent respiratory hospitalization, baseline forced vital capacity (FVC, a measure of lung function), and 24-week change in FVC. The GAP index: This staging system is based on four baseline variablesgender (G),age (A) and two lung physiology variables (P) (FVC plus the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, or DLCO,).The GAP index uses these variables to categorize patients in three different stages, which estimate the individual risk for patients. gender (G), age (A) and  two lung physiology variables (P) (FVC plus the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, or DLCO,). The GAP index uses these variables to categorize patients in three different stages, which estimate the individual risk for patients."
Which specialties of doctors treat pulmonary fibrosis?,"'If you have not been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, but have any symptoms of the disease such as shortness of breath, chronic dry cough, diminished exercise tolerance, shallow breathing, chest discomfort, weakness, or other symptoms, see a doctor.''If you have already been diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or probable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis you should be monitored regularly, and you should referred for evaluation for lung transplantation, even if one is not needed at the immediate time. ' "
How is pulmonary fibrosis diagnosed?,"'Pulmonary fibrosis is suggested by a history of progressive (worsening over time) shortness of breath with exertion. Sometimes, during examination of the lungs with a stethoscope, the doctor can hear crackling sounds in the chest.  These crackles have a very characteristic sound and are very similar to the sound heard when Velcro is pulled apart.  These are often referred to as ""''Velcro crackles'' (or rales)"". The ''chest X-ray'' may or may not be abnormal. However, a special X-ray test called a high resolution ''CT scan'' will frequently demonstrate abnormalities. This type of X-ray provides a cross-sectional picture of the lungs in very detailed resolution. The classic findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis show diffuse peripheral scarring of the lungs with small bubbles (known as bullae) adjacent to the outer lining of the surface of the lung, often at the bases of the lungs. '' Lung function testing is distinctly abnormal. The volumes of the lungs may be reduced, as may the airflow, but the characteristic finding is a reduction in the diffusing capacity.  The diffusing capacity is a measure of the ability of the lungs to exchange gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) into and out of the blood stream.''The diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis can be confirmed by lung biopsy. An open surgical biopsy, meaning that the chest wall must be surgically opened under general anesthesia to remove a portion of lung tissue, may be necessary to obtain enough tissue to make an accurate diagnosis.  The most common type of biopsy in this situation is by a ''video assisted thoracoscope''.  This involves placing a small tube into the chest ''cavity'' through which biopsy samples can be obtained.  Often, if the clinical situation is very classical in presentation, a biopsy may be unnecessary.  The biopsy specimen is examined microscopically by a pathologist to confirm the presence of fibrosis. ' "
What is the treatment for pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are very limited. There is no evidence that any medications can help this condition, since scarring is permanent once it has developed. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available. At times, this diagnosis can be difficult to make even with tissue biopsy reviewed by pathologists with specific experience in this field. ''Research trials'' using different ''drugs'' that may reduce fibrous scarring are ongoing. ''Two drugs, nintedanib (Ofev) and''pirfenidone'' (''Esbriet'', pirfenex, Pirespa) have offered some new hope. The results from two large studies show some slowing of progression of fibrosis, as well as some minor changes to tests of lung function. Unfortunately, the side effects from both of these drugs have resulted in some patients being unable to take this medication.''Since some types of lung fibrosis can respond to ''corticosteroids'' (such as ''prednisone'"") or other medications that suppress the body's immune system; these types of drugs sometimes are prescribed in an attempt to decrease the processes that lead to fibrosis. These drugs do not help idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, other causes of lung fibrosis may be responsive to immune suppression.""'The immune system is felt to play a central role in the development of many forms of pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of treatment with immune suppressive agents such as corticosteroids is to decrease lung inflammation and subsequent scarring. Responses to treatment are variable. Once scarring has developed, it is permanent. Conditions that improve with immune suppressive treatment probably are not idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ''The toxicity and side effects of treatments can be serious. Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis should be followed by a lung specialist experienced in this condition. The lung specialist will determine the need and duration of treatment, and will monitor the response to therapy along with any side effects. ''Only a minority of patients respond to corticosteroids alone, so other immune-suppressing medications are used in addition to corticosteroids especially if a different cause for ''interstitial lung disease'' is suspected. These include:''The anti-inflammatory medication ''colchicine'' has also been used with limited success. Other trials using drugs such as gamma ''interferon'' and ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') have not met with much success in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.''Pulmonary fibrosis causes decreased oxygen levels in the blood. A decrease in blood oxygen level (''hypoxia'') can lead to elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery (the vessel that carries blood from the ''heart'' to the lungs to receive oxygen), a condition known as ''pulmonary hypertension'', which can in turn lead to failure of the ''right ventricle'' of the heart. Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis are frequently treated with supplemental oxygen therapy to prevent ''pulmonary hypertension''. ''A consensus statement was issued revising the 2011 clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This statement was issued by one the largest respiratory physician groups in the world, including members from the United States, Europe, Japan, and Latin America. These recommendations are partially based on a recent study involving the use of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine, so called triple therapy.  In this study, drug recipients had a 10 fold increase in the death rate than the placebo group.   These new guidelines therefore strongly discourage the use of triple therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These guidelines also suggest that anticoagulation and anti ''GERD'' (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'') not be administered for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis alone.  These medications should not be used without other medical indications in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lastly, patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis often have pulmonary ''hypertension'' as their disease progresses. There is currently no indication to use pulmonary hypertensive medication in these patients except oxygen in those with low oxygen levels.

What about pulmonary rehabilitation for pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Pulmonary rehabilitation along with medical care helps improve the quality of life of people who have chronic breathing problems such as pulmonary fibrosis. It involves: ''Patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who are current ''smokers'' are encouraged to quit. It is also recommended that patients with IPF receive vaccination against ''influenza'' and pneumococcal infection.' Exercise conditioning Nutrition counseling Patient education on managing the 
disease Breathing strategies Techniques to help conserve energy Counseling and/or support groups"
What are the complications of pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tends to be relentless in its progression. The complications that occur are a reflection of the failure of the pulmonary system.  Shortness of breath, decreased activity, and signs of heart failure can occur.  As the lungs fail, the ''blood pressure'' in the lungs rises.  This results in increased work for and ultimately failure of the right side of the heart which pumps the blood through the lungs.  This failure can result in ''fatigue'', ''leg swelling'', and overall fluid accumulation in the body.  The immobility and sluggish blood flow can increase the risks for ''blood clots''.  ''Depression'' is frequently seen in this devastating disease.' "
Can pulmonary fibrosis be prevented?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has an increased frequency in ''cigarette'' smokers. The cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is unknown, and therefore ''prevention'' is difficult.  There is a rare form of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is hereditary (runs in families). Work is being done at National Jewish Hospital in Denver, CO trying to identify markers for this disease.''Unfortunately, since this is a fatal disease without effective therapy, there are many charlatans trying to take advantage of these stricken individuals and their families. There is no evidence that ''special diets'' or ''supplements'' or bowel preparations will help this disease in any way. ' "
Where can I get information to improve the quality of life for those with pulmonary fibrosis?,'For information quality of life and living with pulmonary fibrosis please visit ''Pulmonaryfibrosis.org''.' 
What is pulmonary hypertension?,"'Pulmonary hypertension occurs when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries increases abnormally. To help explain this condition further, here is how the pulmonary arteries work.''The ''human body'' has two major sets of blood vessels that distribute blood from the heart to the body. One set pumps blood from the right heart to the lungs, and the other from the ''left heart'' to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). When a doctor or a nurse measures the ''blood pressure'"" on a person's arm, he/she is measuring the pressures in the systemic circulation. When these pressures are abnormally high, the person is diagnosed as having ""'high blood pressure'' (systemic hypertension).''The portion of the circulation that distributes the blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and back to the left side of the heart is referred to as the pulmonary (lung) circulation.''The ''right ventricle'' pumps blood returning from the body into the pulmonary arteries to the lungs to receive oxygen. The pressures in the lung arteries (pulmonary arteries) are normally significantly lower than the pressures in the systemic circulation. When pressure in the pulmonary circulation becomes abnormally elevated, it is referred to as pulmonary hypertension. This most commonly occurs when the pulmonary venous pressure is elevated, so-called pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH). This pressure is transmitted back to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary arteries. The result is elevated pulmonary pressure throughout the pulmonary circulation. Some of this is a direct pressure transmission from the venous system backward and some can result from a reactive constriction of the pulmonary arteries.''Less commonly, pulmonary hypertension results from constriction, or stiffening, of the pulmonary arteries that supply blood to the lungs, so-called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).''Whether it is pulmonary venous or pulmonary arterial hypertension, it becomes more difficult for the heart to pump blood forward through the lungs. This ''stress'' on the heart leads to enlargement of the right heart, and eventually fluid can build up in the liver and other tissues, such as the in the legs.''When the heart pumps blood, it is referred to as systole, and when the heart fills with blood it is referred to as diastole. Normal pulmonary artery pressures range from an upper pressure (systolic) of 15-30 mmHg and a lower pressure (diastolic) of 4-12 mmHg. These values can be obtained approximately by an\xa0''ultrasound'' of the heart (echocardiogram), and more accurately using a catheter to measure the pressures in the pulmonary circulation (right heart catheterization).'  "
What causes pulmonary hypertension?,"'There are many causes of pulmonary hypertension. Often more than one mechanism is involved in a specific disease process. This can also change as the disease progresses.''Primary pulmonary hypertension has no identifiable underlying cause. This term is mainly a historical name and no longer used. The current term used to describe this condition is idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is more common in young people and more common in females than males.''Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension unusually is an aggressive and often fatal form of pulmonary hypertension. Whereas it is known that the arterial obstruction is caused by a building up of the smooth muscle cells that line the arteries, the underlying cause of the disease has long been a mystery.'""A genetic cause of the familial form of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, now referred to as Heritable PAH, has been discovered. It is caused by mutations in a gene called BMPR2. BMPR2 encodes a receptor (a transforming growth factor beta type II receptor) that sits on the surface of cells and binds molecules of the TGF-beta superfamily. Binding triggers conformational changes that are shunted down into the cell's interior where a series of biochemical reactions occur, ultimately affecting the cell's behavior. The mutations block this process. This discovery may provide a means of genetic diagnosis and a potential target for the therapy of people with familial (and possibly also sporadic) primary pulmonary hypertension."" Diseases that affect flow out of the heart to the rest of the body result in backflow of blood (stacking of blood) that raises pulmonary venous pressures leading to pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is the process in which the lung vessels narrow in attempt to divert blood from poorly functioning segments of the lung. For instance, when pneumonia develops, a portion of lung becomes inflamed and works poorly in performing the functions of the lung (to add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the blood). This process diverts blood from these poorly working areas and sends it to better functioning lung tissue. However, a problem develops when all the blood has a low oxygen level (hypoxia). This causes constriction of the vessels on the pulmonary arterial side and hence raises the pressure. Remodeling of blood vessels also occurs in some diseases whereby the inner lining (lumen) of the vessel becomes narrowed due to inappropriate growth of the tissue within and around the vessel. Masses and scarring from other diseases can compress and narrow vessels causing increased resistance to flow resulting in elevation of pressures. In a fairly common parasitic infection in the Middle East (schistosomiasis), the blood vessels in the lung become blocked by the parasites causing pulmonary artery hypertension. Some substances cause constriction of the blood vessels. Pulmonary hypertension has been rarely reported with the use of anti-obesity drugs, such as dexfenfluramine (Redux) and Fen/Phen. These medications have seen been removed from the market. Some street drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines, can cause severe pulmonary hypertension. Some diseases raise pulmonary pressures to cause pulmonary artery hypertension for unclear reasons. Perhaps an unknown toxin or chemical effects the blood vessels by causing constriction or inappropriate growth of the tissue within or around the vessel. For example, there is a condition known as portopulmonary hypertension that is a result of liver failure. When these individuals receive a liver transplant, the pulmonary hypertension disappears suggesting that the failing liver is unable to clear some biochemical that leads to pulmonary artery hypertension."
Which diseases are common in people with the condition?,"'There are no clear statistical data on the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. Since pulmonary hypertension is seen in multiple different conditions, it is perhaps better to look at the prevalence in each condition. It is fairly common in patients with ''heart failure'', ''COPD'', and ''sleep apnea''. It occurs in 7% to 12% of patients with ''collagen vascular disease'', and in less than 5% of ''HIV'' patients.' "
Signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension,"'Many people with pulmonary hypertension may have no symptoms at all, especially if the disease is mild or in the early stages.''Pulmonary hypertension symptoms may include:''Signs of pulmonary hypertension may include:'   Shortness of breath that worsens with activity Other common complaints are cough, fatigue, dizziness, and lethargy. With the advancement of the condition and ensuing right heart failure, shortness of breath may become worse and retention of fluid in the body may increase (due to failure of the heart to pump blood forward) resulting in swelling in the legs. People may also complain of chest pain and angina. Depending on the underlying associated disease, pulmonary artery hypertension can have other manifestations. For example, characteristic skin changes seen in scleroderma, or the signs of liver disease seen in portopulmonary hypertension. Rapid breathing, hypoxia (low oxygen level in the blood), and swelling in the legs. In severe pulmonary hypertension, the health care professional may hear louder than normal components of heart sounds when he or she listens to the heart with a stethoscope (auscultation). The doctor may also feel elevation of the chest wall when the heart pumps and this may indicate enlargement of the right side of the heart suggestive of pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular heave)."
Classification of primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension,"'The conventional classification, primary (idiopathic) and secondary pulmonary hypertension, which also is called pulmonary arterial hypertension, has been reclassified and is now based on the main underlying cause, characteristics, and treatments of pulmonary hypertension. These terms were updated in 2013. This system classifies the condition based on five classes.''Pulmonary arterial hypertension including idiopathic previously referred to as primary pulmonary arterial hypertension), ''inherited'' pulmonary arterial hypertension, drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension''Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with the following:''Pulmonary hypertension due to left ''heart disease'':''Pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (low oxygen levels). This includes:'""Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (chronic blood clots to the lungs that don't dissolve, also termed CTEPH).""'Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms, for example:'  Connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, or scleroderma HIV Liver disease (elevated pressures in the liver, portal hypertension); Congenital heart disease Schistosomiasis (a parasite infection that can clog the pulmonary arteries) Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (very rare) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn An elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure because of increased pulmonary venous pressure backing up into the lungs Heart failure due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction Valvular heart disease Some congenital/acquired heart diseases Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) Interstitial lung diseases Sleep apnea Chronic exposure to high altitudes Congenital lung disease Blood disorders (including hemolytic anemias) Systemic disorders (such as sarcoid) Metabolic disorders where cellular chemistry is abnormal (such as glycogen storage diseases) Tumors, fibrosis, and other problems obstructing blood flow through the lungs"
Which types of doctors treat pulmonary hypertension?,"'Generally, pulmonary physicians (pulmonologists) and cardiologists treat pulmonary hypertension. Depending on the cause, other physicians also may be involved, such as ''sleep'' medicine doctors, ''rheumatologists'', and perhaps even infectious disease specialists. Today, more health care professionals in the community are becoming adept at managing pulmonary hypertension. However, it is reasonable to get a second opinion regarding management at a tertiary, university setting, because the field of management of pulmonary artery hypertension is evolving rapidly.' "
How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed?,"'The first step in diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is to clinically suspect it. This may be done as part of an evaluation of another disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension (such as scleroderma or ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'""), or based on patients'\xa0signs and symptoms as described above.""'Pulmonary hypertension is defined as the mean pulmonary artery blood pressure greater than 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) measured by right heart catheterization. The pressures can be much higher than 25 mmHg in some people. Therefore, the pulmonary hypertension can be labeled as mild, moderate, or severe based on the pressures. Mean arterial pressure calculated by multiplying the diagnostic pressure two times, and adding the systolic pressure to that number, and then divide by three (systolic is the upper number and diastolic is the lower number in measuring blood pressure). Normally, the pulmonary blood pressure is a much lower pressure system than the systemic blood pressure (which is usually measured with a blood pressure cuff).''Other tests available for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension include ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG''), ''chest X-ray'', and echocardiogram. An ECG may show some abnormalities that may be suggestive of right heart failure. Chest X-ray may also show enlargement of the chambers of the right heart. And echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) shows ultrasound images of the heart and can detect evidence of right heart failure and, with the use of Doppler, (as described previously) can estimate pressures in the pulmonary artery. These tests, in the right clinical setting, are very useful in diagnosing and managing pulmonary hypertension.''Other tests may be useful in evaluating the conditions leading to secondary pulmonary hypertension. For example, a ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) can suggest blood clots in the pulmonary arteries or sometimes a ''CT scan'' of the chest can be used. The chest CT scan can detect pulmonary arterial clots, but also can show abnormalities of the lung tissue and surrounding structures that can contribute to pulmonary hypertension.''Pulmonary function testing can be useful in diagnosing ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD), and other lung diseases, and monitoring disease progression. This test can be used to detect many aspects of lung function including airflow and evidence of obstruction, lung volumes, and the capacity for the lung to extract oxygen from the air.''Sleep'' studies can confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea and its severity and management options such as ''CPAP'' therapy.' Many tests, such as echocardiogram, may be performed that may give clues to the possibility of pulmonary hypertension. It is important that a Doppler study be performed with the echocardiogram, which enables the doctor to approximate the pulmonary artery pressures. These values are calculated based on the sound quality of the wave approaching and leaving the echocardiogram machine sensor/probe. This is based on the principle that explains why the sound of an approaching and then passing train varies. But the gold standard (the best test available) is right heart catheterization. This test entails inserting a catheter through the groin into the femoral vein, a large vein in the lower body (or under the collar bone or in the upper arm or neck into a large vein in the upper body) and advancing it to the right side of the heart. The catheter is connected to a device that can monitor and measure blood pressure in the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries.During right heart catheterization, oxygen levels are measured during various positions of the catheter in the pulmonary circulation. This can help determine if a congenital or acquired hole has formed in the heart contributing to the elevated pulmonary pressures. Certain medications or activities can be administered or performed during the procedure to help with the assessment. Nitric oxide can be inhaled and in certain forms of PAH a dramatic improvement in pressures can occur, suggesting specific treatment options such as the use of calcium channel blocker medication. Some patients have an exaggerated pulmonary pressure response to exercise and this too can be measured by utilizing arm exercise during the procedure. Titration of medications for pulmonary hypertension while the catheter is in place can help monitor the response to treatment and assist in optimizing therapy. This can assist in providing individualized therapy for patients with this complex disease.

What is the treatment for pulmonary hypertension?,"'The treatment for pulmonary hypertension depends on the underlying cause.'   If left-sided heart failure is the primary problem, then adequate treatment of the left heart failure by a cardiologist is the mainstay of treatment. In cases where hypoxia (low oxygen levels) due to any chronic lung disease, such as COPD, is the cause, then providing oxygen and appropriately treating the underlying lung disease by a lung doctor (pulmonologist) is the first step in treatment. In some patients, the elevated pressure may be related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and can be reduced with the use of a CPAP (a device that delivers positive airway pressure during sleep). In conditions, such as scleroderma, which often can cause pulmonary hypertension, a rheumatologist is involved in the treatment program. Anticoagulation (thinning the blood) may be a treatment option if the main underlying cause is thought to be recurrent blood clot (chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension). As indicated in a previous section, referral to a specialty center may be warranted for a possible surgical removal of blood clot (thromboendarterectomy). For patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (those with no underlying cause), more advanced therapy may be attempted. These drugs have complex mechanisms, but in general they work by dilating (opening up) the pulmonary arteries and, therefore, by reducing the pressure in these blood vessels, and some help prevent the excessive overgrowth of tissue in the blood vessels (that decrease remodeling of the vessels, as described previously). Besides constriction, PAH can result in an actual structural change of the pulmonary arteries; whether it is due to chronically elevated pressures, the disease itself, or a combination of the two is not completely clear. These drugs also can delay and, in some cases, reduce the degree of remodeling of the pulmonary arteries."
What are pulmonary hypertension medications?,"'There are three major classes of drugs used to treat idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with collagen vascular diseases: 1) prostaglandins; 2) phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor; and 3) endothelium-receptor antagonists.''Currently, research is investigating the best ways to combine these medications for the optimal clinical outcomes. It should be noted that these medications are extremely expensive. The companies that manufacture these medications often have programs to assist in funding. These more advanced therapies have also been used for other forms of pulmonary hypertension; however, no clinical studies have yet confirmed benefits in these situations.' Prostaglandins such as epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso), iloprost (Ventavis). These drugs are very short-acting and often must be given intravenously or inhaled on a very frequent or continuous basis. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) are somewhat less effective than the prostaglandins but are easily administered one to three times per day by mouth. (The dosing is much different when these drugs are used for erectile dysfunction.) Endothelium antagonists are the newest medications used for this condition. These include bosentan (Tracleer) and ambrisentan (Letairis). These medications are also given by mouth one to two times per day. A unique drug, riociguat (Adempas), is indicated for pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease (CTEPH). The mechanism of action is different then the drugs above. It works by increasing the effect of nitric oxide causing increased pulmonary vasodilation. In rare cases, calcium channel blockers (CCBS) may be of benefit."
Is there a cure for pulmonary hypertension?,"'Despite advances in various treatments, there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension.' "
What is the life expectancy for people with pulmonary hypertension?,"'Generally, the prognosis of pulmonary hypertension\xa0varies depending on the underlying condition that is causing it. For idiopathic or familial pulmonary hypertension, the overall prognosis depends on the severity and whether treatment was instituted. The statistics show a survival of about 3 years in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension without any therapy. Some of the other factors may indicate even poorer prognosis, which includes severe symptoms, age of onset greater than 45 years, evidence of right-sided heart failure, and failure to respond to treatment. For patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension who get started on treatment and respond to it, the prognosis is better. Studies are underway to determine optimal treatment regimens.' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is oximetry?,'Oximetry is a procedure for measuring the concentration of oxygen in the blood. The test is used in the evaluation of various medical conditions that affect the function of the ''heart'' and ''lungs''.' 
How is oximetry done?,"'This is done using an oximeter, a photoelectric device specially designed for this purpose.  A reusable probe can be placed on the finger or a single use tape probe is placed on the earlobe or finger.' "
What are pulse oximeters?,"'The oximeters most commonly used today are called pulse oximeters because they respond only to pulsations, such as those in pulsating capillaries of the area tested.'  "
How common are oximeters?,"'Oximeters are now a virtual fixture in intensive care units, pulmonary units and elsewhere in hospitals and health care facilities.' "
How does a pulse oximeter function?,"'A pulse oximeter works by passing a beam of red and infrared light through a pulsating capillary bed. The ratio of red to infrared blood light transmitted gives a measure of the oxygen saturation of the blood.  The oximeter works on the principle that the oxygenated blood is a brighter color of red than the deoxygenated blood, which is more blue-purple. First, the oximeter measures the sum of the intensity of both shades of red, representing the fractions of the blood with and without oxygen. The oximeter detects the pulse, and then subtracts the intensity of color detected when the pulse is absent. The remaining intensity of color represents only the oxygenated red blood. This is displayed on the electronic screen as a percentage of oxygen saturation in the blood.' "
Are there other types of oximetry?,"'Yes. Oximetry can also be done on blood that is within the heart (intracardiac oximetry) or on whole blood that has been removed from the body.  More recently, using a similar technology to oximetry, carbon dioxide levels can be measured at the skin as well.' "
What is an insulin pump?,"'The ''insulin pump'' is a device for continuous ''insulin'' delivery. An insulin pump is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. '  "
How big is an insulin pump?,"'Currently, pumps on the market are about the size of a standard communications beeper. ' "
How does an insulin pump work?,"'The typical insulin pump isattached to a thin ''plastic'' tube (an infusion set) that has a soft cannula (or plasticneedle) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted underthe skin, usually on the abdomen. The cannula is changed every two days. Thetubing can be disconnected from the pump while showering or ''swimming''. The pumpis used for continuous insulin delivery, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulinis programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, theamount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies depending on factorslike ''exercise'', activity level, and''sleep''.''The insulin pump allows the user to program many different basal rates toallow for variation in lifestyle. In addition, the user can program thepump to deliver a bolus (large dose of insulin) during meals to cover the excess demands ofcarbohydrate ingestion.' "
How common is an insulin pump?,"'Hundreds of thousands of people with ''diabetes'' worldwide are using an insulin pump. Although insulin pumps were first used by people with ''type 1 diabetes'', people with ''type 2 diabetes'' sometime use them as well. Many children successfully use insulin pumps. Insulin pumps allow for tight blood ''sugar'' control and lifestyle flexibility while minimizing the effects of ''low blood sugar'' (''hypoglycemia''). Newer models of the pump have been developed that do not require a tubing, in fact - the insulin delivery device is placed directly on the skin and any adjustments needed for insulin delivery are made through a PDA like device that must be kept within a 6 foot range of the insulin delivery device, and can be worn in a pocket, kept in a purse, or on a tabletop when working.''Probably the most exciting innovation in pump technology is the ability to use the pump in tandem with newer glucose sensing technology, known as an ""artificial pancreas,"" that administers insulin based on actual glucose levels as determined by the glucose sensor. The first such device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2013. Manufactured by Medtronic, the device is approved for use in people with ''diabetes'' who are 16 years of age or older. With the new device, insulin delivery is halted if a pre-programmed glucose level threshold is met. In a recent study conducted on 95 patients in Australia, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with automated insulin suspension reduced the rate of hypoglycemia in patients with ''type 1 diabetes''. Further studies of this coupled ""closed-loop"" technology (continuously sensing and responding to the body\'s needs)  are ongoing. ' "
Why is an obstetrics ultrasound done?,"'Obstetric ultrasound is usually performed every three to four weeks to monitor the fetus and pregnant uterus throughout pregnancy.''First-trimester obstetric ultrasound:''An ultrasound is first performed to confirm a viable pregnancy. It may be performed either trans-abdominal (the transducer is placed over the abdomen) or trans-vaginally (the transducer is narrow and placed in the vagina). Sometimes, both may be done simultaneously. It is ideally performed before 13-14 weeks of pregnancy. A first-trimester ultrasound examination can help diagnose a ''miscarriage'' early and the presence of multifetal gestations (multiple fetuses such as twins or triplets). A first-trimester ultrasound also helps to evaluate the mother’s reproductive system to detect anatomical abnormalities and pathologies.''Second- and third-trimester obstetric ultrasound:''Second- and third-trimester ultrasounds help to assess fetal growth and anatomy. An obstetric ultrasound examination may also include evaluation of the fetal position, ''amniotic fluid'' volume around the fetus in the uterus, location of the placenta, fetus’s cardiac activity, the fetal spine, and fetal anomalies.''If fetal anomalies are detected between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, termination of pregnancy may still be an option. Motioning the fetus with the help of ultrasound helps to monitor fetal health, determine the mode of delivery, and calculate the estimated fetal weight and amniotic fluid. Fetal growth evaluations are typically performed every three to four weeks.' "
How do you prepare for an obstetric ultrasound?,"'The preparation required for a trans-abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound is minimal. Some doctors advise their patients to arrive with a full bladder for an ultrasound, especially when an obstetric ultrasound is performed after 18 weeks of pregnancy. If a transvaginal ultrasound is to be performed, the patient is asked to void (empty the bladder by urination) just before the ultrasound. This reduces discomfort and collapses the bladder for better visualization of the pelvic organs. Ultrasound transducers are not disposable; hence, it is advisable for patients to visit a center that follows proper hygiene protocols because the transducers require proper cleaning before and after each patient’s use to avoid infection. Trans-abdominal ultrasound transducers are typically cleaned with disposable antiseptic wipes, and the clean transducer may be applied directly to the patient’s skin. Trans-vaginal transducers are usually covered with a disposal cover during the ultrasound. After the ultrasound, the patient can go home right after and return to their usual activities.' "
What is endoscopy?," Standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopes (120 cm flexible tubes with a light and camera on their tips) are capable of reaching only a foot or so past the stomach into the small intestine. If abnormalities are located within this area, these endoscopes have working channels through which surgical instruments can be passed so that diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as biopsy and electrocautery can be done. Many abnormalities of the small bowel, however, lie further along the small intestine beyond the reach of the standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopes. Sometimes a colonoscope, similar to the upper gastrointestinal endoscope but 180 cm in length, can be used to reach a little further into the small intestine, but the additional reach of colonoscopes is limited. It is not the length of the endoscope that is the most important problem in reaching further into the small intestine. The problem is that the path of the endoscope through the stomach and duodenum is twisty and the endoscopes curl in the stomach. In addition, the small intestine is not fixed in place, and this makes advancement of the endoscopes even more difficult."
What is push endoscopy?,"'Push ''endoscopy'' (also referred to as push enteroscopy) is a procedure that allows diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the upper small intestine. Push endoscopy reaches further into the small intestine than the standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (also known as ''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'', ''EGD''). ''Endoscopes for push endoscopy are similar in length to colonoscopes, approximately 200cm and have working channels for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. After the endoscope is passed into the duodenum, a more rigid overtube is passed over the endoscope to straighten its path. With the overtube in place, the endoscope then can be advanced without coiling in the stomach. ' "
What are the advantages of push endoscopy?,"'Push endoscopy is a useful procedure for examining and delivering therapy in the small intestine. For example, for patients with intermittently bleeding angiodysplasias (clusters of weakened blood vessels) located in the small intestine beyond the reach of a standard upper endoscope, push endoscopy can be helpful in both diagnosing the bleeding site as well as in stopping the bleeding. ' "
What are the limitations of push endoscopy?,"'Push endoscopy has its limitations. Its reach is still limited and cannot diagnose lesions in the distal small intestine (intestine closer to the colon). The major risks of push endoscopy are the same as other endoscopic procedures, bleeding and perforation of the intestine, either due to passage of the endoscope or the accompanying therapeutic procedures. Because of the use of an overtube, the risk of perforation probably is increased over the risks of an endoscope alone.' "
What is PUVA?,"'PUVA is an acronym. The P stands for psoralen, the U for ultra, the V for violet, and the A for that portion of the solar spectrum between 320 and 400 nanometers in wavelength. Psoralens are chemicals found in certain plants that have the ability to absorb ultraviolet light in the UVA portion of the solar spectrum. Once the light energy is absorbed, these psoralens are energized to interact with DNA, ultimately inhibiting cell multiplication, which is its presumed mode of action.''Certain skin diseases are characterized by cells that are rapidly multiplying. Inhibiting this unrestrained proliferation can be useful in treating these diseases. So PUVA is a combination of an oral drug and subsequent ultraviolet light exposure.' "
What diseases does PUVA therapy treat?,"'One of the skin diseases for which PUVA is used and for which it was originally developed is ''psoriasis''. The psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) (''Oxsoralen''), is used for the treatment of ''psoriasis'' along with exposures to ultraviolet light in the UVA spectrum. PUVA is also of benefit in treating ''vitiligo'', mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell ''lymphoma''), and graft versus host disease.' "
What are the different types of PUVA therapy?,"'The most common form of therapy combines 8-methoxypsoralen taken by mouth followed 45-60 minutes later by exposure of the skin to UVA. Less commonly, the drug is applied topically (the medication is occasionally diluted in bathtub water in which the patient is immersed) and then after a few minutes the ultraviolet exposure occurs.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of PUVA?,"'The major advantage to PUVA is that it is an effective therapy that becomes active only at the site of exposure. It can be used to treat large areas of skin, and the fact that the drug is only activated in the presence of UV light implies that it may be less toxic than other therapies that require systemic administration and whose effects are not localized to just the skin.'""Since PUVA must be administered under a physician's supervision, it requires repeated visits to the office or clinic. PUVA does not cure ""'psoriasis'' so treatment may be required indefinitely.' "
How is PUVA therapy administered?,"""The psoralen medication is taken 45-60 minutes prior to the ultraviolet light exposure. The amount of the psoralen is based on the weight of the patient. The length of the exposure depends on the degree of the patient's pigmentation. Accordingly, the darker the patient, the longer the exposure time. Depending on the equipment used, the exposure may occur in a metal light box surrounding the patient with the bulbs that run vertically and are generally 48 inches long and resemble fluorescent bulbs. In newer boxes, there is an integrated light meter that enables the operator to administer the desired amount of energy with an automatic shut off after that dosage of light is achieved."" "
How many PUVA treatments are necessary?,"""There ought to be a significant improvement in the patient's skin disease after about 15 treatments. Treatments are given no sooner than 48 hours apart because the ""'burn'"" (if there is one) induced by PUVA is often delayed for as long as two days (unlike ordinary sunburns). Unless there is a problem, the amount of energy administered to the patient is increased appropriately at each visit depending on the patient's coloration. After about 30 treatments, a decision is made as to whether to continue treatments. PUVA is not always effective. If there is no improvement after these treatments, it is probably unlikely that continuing this form of treatment is worthwhile. On the other hand, if significant clearing has occurred, it is probably prudent to decrease the frequency of treatments in order to maintain the improvement. Since there is a relationship between the amount of light energy administered and the degree of photo-""'aging'' and the induction of ''skin cancers'', it is wise to limit the light exposures as appropriate.' "
What are PUVA light therapy side effects?,"'PUVA has a definite potential to cause ''skin cancer'', including melanomas. The risk of developing ''skin cancer'' is directly related to the amount of energy administered. PUVA will cause photo-''aging'' (dry and wrinkled with pigment alterations called lentigenes) that is unavoidable. If not appropriately monitored, PUVA can produce severe ultraviolet light ''burns''. Occasionally, ''Oxsoralen'' can cause ''nausea'' so susceptible patients take the drug with food.'  "
How effective is PUVA therapy?,"'PUVA is a safe and effective treatment for ''psoriasis''. Recently, a newer treatment has supplanted it to some extent, utilizing a different wavelength of light called ""narrow band UVB."" Although a visit to a physician\'s office is still necessary to administer the light, it is not necessary to take a drug by mouth. Both types of treatments are similar in their effectiveness.''PUVA is also useful in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell ''lymphoma'', mycosis fungoides, and certain difficult cases of ''atopic dermatitis'"". Extracorporeal photophoresis is a variation of PUVA where a portion of the patient's white blood cells are removed and then mixed with a psoralen preparation prior to exposure to a UVA source in a machine external to the body. These treated cells are then infused back into the patient. This type of treatment is effective for patients with Sézary's syndrome, a type of leukemic mycosis fungoides, as well as graft vs. host disease."" "

What are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)?,"'Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, PVC) are premature heartbeats originating from the ventricles of the ''heart''. Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat.''Normal function of the heart''The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles.''The heartbeat is normally controlled by the electrical system of the heart. The electrical system of the heart consists of the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node and special tissues in the ventricles that conduct electricity.'""The SA node is the heart's electrical ""'pacemaker''. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the ''right atrium''; the frequency with which the SA node discharges electricity determines the rate at which the heart normally beats. The SA node keeps the heart beating in a regular manner. At rest, the frequency of the electrical discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate at which the heart beats. In people who ''exercise'' regularly, the resting heart rate may be below 50 to 60 and is not of concern.''The electrical discharges pass from the SA node through the special tissues of the atria into the ''AV node'' and through the ''AV node'' to the special conduction tissues of the ventricles, causing them to contract.''{C}'   The atria deliver blood to the ventricles, and the ventricles deliver blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body. The right ventricle delivers blood to the lungs while the left ventricle delivers blood to the rest of the body. The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles."
What happens during a premature ventricular contraction?,"'During a premature ventricular contraction, the ventricle electrically discharges (and contracts) prematurely before the normal electrical discharges arrive from the SA node. These premature discharges are due to electrical ""irritability"" of the heart muscle of the ventricles and can be caused by ''heart attacks'', ''electrolyte'' imbalances, lack of oxygen, or medications. Immediately after a premature ventricular contraction, the electrical system of the heart resets. This resetting causes a brief pause in heartbeat, and some patients report feeling the heart briefly stopping after a premature ventricular contraction. ' "
How common are premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions are common. Many people have premature ventricular contractions without any symptoms. Premature ventricular contractions may be more common among older patients, patients with ''high blood pressure'', and patients with ''heart disease''. Premature ventricular contractions can also occur in young healthy individuals without ''heart disease'' or ''high blood pressure''. ' "
What causes premature ventricular contractions?,"'There are many causes of premature ventricular contractions, which include'   heart attack; high blood pressure;  cardiomyopathy, including congestive heart failure;  disease of heart valves such as mitral valve prolapse;  hypokalemia (low blood levels of potassium), and hypomagnesaemia (low blood levels of magnesium) -- hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia can occur, for example, in patients taking diuretics (water pills); hypoxia (low amounts of oxygen in the blood), for example, hypoxia occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);  medications such as digoxin (Lanoxin), aminophylline (Phyllocontin, Truphylline), tricyclic antidepressants, and ephedrine-containing, decongestants; excessive intake of alcohol; excess caffeine intake; stimulant drug use such as cocaine, and amphetamines;  myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and cardiac contusion (heart muscle injury), and  premature ventricular contractions also occur in healthy individuals without heart diseases. "
What are premature ventricular contraction symptoms?,"'Patients with mild infrequent premature ventricular contractions often report no symptoms (asymptomatic) and are unaware of their premature ventricular contractions. Their premature ventricular contractions may be discovered when an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'') is performed for a routine physical, insurance physical, or preoperative evaluation.''Patients with premature ventricular contractions sometimes report ''palpitations'' in the chest and in the neck. ''Palpitations'' are discomforting feelings due to forceful heartbeats. The heartbeat immediately after a premature ventricular contraction is usually stronger (the ''heart ventricle'' contracts more forcefully) than normal. Patients with premature ventricular contractions may report feeling that the heart has stopped briefly. This is because there is usually a brief pause in heartbeat after a premature ventricular contraction when the electrical system of the heart resets. Moreover, the actual premature ventricular contraction beat may not be felt because the heart hasn\'t had time to fill with blood before beating so patients with PVCs often complain of ""skipped"" or ""missed"" beats.''Patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions such as bigeminy (every other heartbeat is a premature ventricular contraction), couplets (two consecutive premature ventricular contractions), or triplets (three consecutive premature ventricular contractions) often report no symptoms. But in rare occasions they may report ''weakness'', ''dizziness'', or ''fainting''. This is because frequent premature ventricular contractions can diminish the ability of the heart to pump blood to the other organs (diminished cardiac output), resulting in ''low blood pressure''.''Patients with three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions in a row have ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia that is prolonged can result in low cardiac output, ''low blood pressure'', and ''fainting'' (''syncope''). Ventricular tachycardia can also develop into ventricular ''fibrillation'', which is a fatal heart rhythm (see below).'  "
What are the dangers of premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions in healthy individuals without ''high blood pressure'' and heart diseases do not pose any health risks. Premature ventricular contractions in patients with heart diseases (''heart attacks'', ''heart failure'', diseases of the heart valves) may be associated with increased risks of developing ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is a sustained run of rapid ventricular contractions. Ventricular tachycardia is life-threatening because: 1) it occurs suddenly with no prior warning, and 2) it frequently develops into ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm where the ventricles quiver rapidly in a purposeless fashion. The heart with ventricular fibrillation cannot pump blood effectively to the brain and the rest of the body. If untreated, ventricular fibrillation can be fatal within minutes. An estimated 325,000 Americans die from ''sudden cardiac arrest'', including ventricular fibrillation, each year. Many doctors believe that premature ventricular contractions do not necessarily cause ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillations. Instead, premature ventricular contractions may be merely indicators (symptoms) of serious heart diseases or other serious conditions such as hypokalemia, hypoxia, and ongoing heart damage from ''heart attacks'', or medications such as digoxin and aminophylline toxicity. It must be emphasized that many premature ventricular contractions are harmless (benign) and not associated with structural ''heart disease''. If the workup for underlying heart disease is unrevealing, the patient can be assured that their prognosis is excellent.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (EKG and Holter)?,"'There are two aspects in the diagnosis of premature ventricular contractions -- detecting them and diagnosing the underlying causes. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) and Holter monitors are used to diagnose premature ventricular contractions. EKGs, blood tests, echocardiograms, and cardiac ''stress'' tests are used to determine the underlying causes of premature ventricular contractions.''Electrocardiogram (EKG)'""An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. EKGs can be performed in the doctors' offices, clinics, and hospital emergency rooms. Doctors frequently ask for a rhythm strip (a prolonged EKG recording) to be performed at the same time as an EKG to increase the chances of detecting premature ventricular contractions and other abnormal rhythms. The premature ventricular contractions are easy to recognize on EKG and rhythms strips, provided premature ventricular contractions occur during the recording. EKG may also demonstrate other problems such as heart attacks, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, and heart muscle thickening (hypertrophy) due to long term high ""'blood pressure''.''Holter monitor'""A standard EKG and a rhythm strip performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not detect the premature ventricular contractions because they may not be occurring at that moment. Holter monitoring is then necessary to detect the premature ventricular contractions in these patients with heart palpitations. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours. Holter monitoring can be used diagnose premature ventricular contractions as well as other heart rhythm abnormalities such as ""'atrial fibrillation'', ''atrial flutter'', and ventricular tachycardias.'""PVCs are present in 1% to 4% in the general population. PVCs can be demonstrated during Holter monitoring. However, not all premature ventricular contractions found during Holter monitoring are clinically important. Doctors interpreting the Holter monitoring studies must take into account the patient's medical history in determining the importance of Holter monitor findings.""'In patients with infrequent symptoms an event marker may be used in lieu of a Holter monitor as this can be worn for up to 30 days.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (echo and stress test)? ,"'Echocardiography''Echocardiography uses ''ultrasound'"" waves to produce images of the heart's chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Echocardiography is useful in measuring the size of the heart chambers, the forcefulness of heart ventricle contractions, the thickness of the heart muscles, and the functioning of the heart valves. Echocardiography is therefore useful in diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions such as:""'Exercise ''cardiac stress test'' (''treadmill stress test'')''Exercise cardiac stress testing'' (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac ''stress'"" test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at 3-minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes may be observed in the EKG, including increases in premature ventricular contractions and development of ventricular tachycardias."" Mitral valve prolapse: Echocardiography can detect and measure the severity of mitral valve prolapse and other valvular diseases. Muscle hypertrophy: Echocardiography can detect heart muscle hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle) as a result of long-term high blood pressure. Heart muscle damage: Echocardiography can measure the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks or cardiomyopathy. Ejection fraction: Echocardiography can be used to calculate the ejection fraction of the left ventricle. Ejection fraction is a measure (estimate) of the amount of blood pumped during each contraction of the ventricle. Heart ventricles extensively weakened by heart attacks or cardiomyopathy will have low ejection fractions. Patients with low ejection fractions have higher risks of developing life-threatening ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations than patients with normal ejection fractions."
How is premature ventricular contraction diagnosed  (ECST and blood tests)? ,"'Adjuncts to ECST (stress echo and nuclear imaging)''Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ultrasound are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of ''cardiovascular disease'', if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant cardiovascular disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. Alternatively, nuclear imaging may be used as an adjunct to ECST and may be even more sensitive in noninvasively detecting underlying ''coronary artery disease''.''Blood tests in diagnosing causes of premature ventricular contractions''Blood tests for diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions include:' blood electrolyte levels can be performed to detect low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia); blood drug levels can be performed to detect digoxin and aminophylline drug toxicity or thyroid levels, for example, an overactive thyroid may result in premature ventricular contractions; blood oxygenation (oximetry) can be measured to detect hypoxia; blood tests can be performed to detect illicit drugs, such as amphetamine abuse; and blood levels of cardiac enzymes (creatine phosphokinase [CPK], troponins [regulatory proteins]) can be performed to assess for heart muscle damage as a result of heart attacks."
What are the reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions?,"'The reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions are:''In healthy individuals without heart disease, premature ventricular contractions need no treatment. For relief of palpitations, one may consider the following measures:'""Conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions can also be potentiality life-threatening. These conditions are often treated in hospital-monitored beds. Monitored beds are beds (or rooms) that are equipped to record the patients' heart rhythm continuously. Patients are also given intravenous medications. These conditions are:""   to relieve symptoms of palpitations; to treat conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions since many conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions are potentially life threatening; and to prevent ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. stop alcohol and caffeine intake; stop the use of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestants that may contain adrenaline such as medications containing pseudoephedrine (certain weight loss supplements may aggravate premature ventricular contractions and should never be used without consulting with one's physician); stop drug abuse such as amphetamines, cocaine; and stop cigarette smoking. low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia) -- potassium and magnesium can be given intravenously; digoxin and aminophylline toxicity -- medications can be given to counteract drug toxicity; acute heart attack -- medications and procedures (coronary angiogram and PTCA) are performed urgently to open blocked coronary arteries to restore blood supply to the heart muscle; and low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) -- oxygen can be given nasally and medications can be given to treat the underlying lung diseases."
What medications treat premature ventricular contractions?,"'Antiarrhythmia medications''Antiarrhythmia medications are used to control premature ventricular contractions with the goal of preventing ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death. Examples of antiarrhythmia medications include ''beta-blockers'' ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'') and several others. Unfortunately, there is little scientific evidence that suppressing premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic medications prevents ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death.''Some antiarrhythmia medications actually can cause ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Thus antiarrhythmic medications are only prescribed cautiously in patients at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and usually initially in the hospital setting. This does not apply to beta-blockers, which are prescribed to many heart patients for many reasons, and not only do not accelerate arrhythmias, but usually decrease premature ventricular contractions. In many patients with premature ventricular contractions and significant underlying cardiac disease, or with severe symptoms, electrophysiology testing (EP) may be recommended. This is a test performed with catheters to see if a patient is at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, which are treated with either medications or sometimes tiny implantable defibrillators.' "
What is peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) refers to diseases of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) located outside the heart and brain. While there are many causes of peripheral vascular disease, doctors commonly use the term peripheral vascular disease to refer to peripheral artery disease (peripheral arterial disease, PAD), a condition that develops when the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the internal organs, arms, and legs become completely or partially blocked as a result of ''atherosclerosis''.' "
Are atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease related?,"'Atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. This buildup of cholesterol plaques causes hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. When this happens in the peripheral circulation, peripheral vascular disease is the result. The atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as ''teens'' in some people). When atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed, atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. Therefore, many adults typically are unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. However, when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with ''aging'', it can cause critical occlusive disease of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen).''Arteries that are narrowed by advanced atherosclerosis can cause diseases in different organs. For example, advanced atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (arteries that supply heart muscles) can lead to ''angina'', coronary ''heart disease'', and ''heart attacks''. Advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) can lead to ''strokes'' and transient ischemic attacks (''TIA''). Advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities can lead to ''pain'' while walking or exercising (''claudication''), deficient ''wound'' healing, and/or leg ulcers.''Atherosclerosis is often generalized, meaning it affects arteries throughout the body. Therefore, patients with ''heart attacks'' are also more likely to develop strokes and peripheral vascular disease, and vice versa.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'Approximately half of people with peripheral artery disease do not experience any symptoms. For patients with symptoms, the most common symptoms are intermittent claudication and rest pain.''Other symptoms and signs of peripheral artery disease include:'   Intermittent claudication refers to arm or leg pain or cramping in the arms or legs that occurs with exercise and goes away with rest. The severity and location of the pain of intermittent claudication vary depending upon the location and extent of blockage of the involved artery. The most common location of intermittent claudication is the calf muscle of the leg, leading to calf or leg pain while walking. The pain in the calf muscle occurs only during exercise such as walking, and the pain steadily increases with continued walking until the patient has to stop due to intolerable pain. Then the pain quickly subsides during rest. Intermittent claudication can affect one or both legs. Rest pain in the legs occurs when the artery occlusion is so critical that there is not enough blood and oxygen supply to the legs even at rest and represents a more serious form of the condition. The pain typically affects the feet, is usually severe, and occurs at night when the patient is lying down, face up. Numbness of the legs or feet Weakness and atrophy (diminished size and strength) of the calf muscle A feeling of coldness in the legs or feet Changes in color of the feet; feet turn pale when they are elevated, and turn dusky red in dependent position Hair loss over the top of the feet and thickening of the toenails Poor wound healing in the legs or feet Painful ulcers and/or gangrene in areas of the feet where blood supply is lost; typically in the toes"
Who is at risk for peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral artery disease (or peripheral arterial disease) that affects approximately 10 million adults in the U.S. About 5% of people over the age of 50 are believed to suffer from peripheral artery disease. Peripheral artery disease is slightly more common in men than in women and most often occurs in older persons (over the age of 50). The known risk factors for peripheral artery disease are those that predispose to the development of atherosclerosis. Risk factors for peripheral artery disease include:''In peripheral artery disease, the risk factors are additive, so that a person with a combination of two risk factors -- ''diabetes'' and ''smoking'', for example -- has an increased likelihood of developing more severe peripheral artery disease than a person with only one risk factor.' High blood cholesterol (elevated levels of the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and triglycerides Low blood levels of the ""good"" HDL cholesterol Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) High blood pressure (hypertension) or a family history of hypertension A family history of atherosclerotic disease Chronic renal failure Overweight or obesity Physical inactivity"
How does atherosclerosis cause disease?,"'Atherosclerosis causes disease in two ways. 1) Atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to the to tissues of the body during times when oxygen demand needs to be increased, for example, during exertion; or 2) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of ''blood clots''), which results in tissue death (necrosis). Exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand; whereas strokes and ''heart attacks'' are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots.''There are many similarities between coronary heart diseases (or ''coronary artery disease'', which is atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease, and the two conditions may coexist in the same individual. For example, patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. However, during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. Lack of blood and oxygen causes ''chest pain'' (exertional angina). Exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. In patients with intermittent claudication, the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example, a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. These patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting.''Patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. These patients have ''chest pain'' at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. Patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). Rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. They are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene.''When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries, blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas, forming a thrombus, a type of ''blood clot'' (plural thrombi). Sometimes pieces of the ''blood clot'' break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond in which they cannot pass. A thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus. Thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage, leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue due to lack of oxygen).''For example, complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes ''heart attack'', while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic ''stroke''. Emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the ''aorta'' (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet, resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes, foot ulcers, and even gangrene.''Sometimes, despite the presence of a severe blockage in an artery, the involved area does not become painful or lose its blood supply due to the presence of collateral vessels. Collateral circulation means that the particular area is supplied by more than one artery, so that that blockage of a single vessel does not result in a severe degree of blood loss. Collateral circulation can develop over time to help provide oxygenated blood to an area where an artery is narrowed. Doctors believe that regular supervised exercise can stimulate the growth and development of collateral circulation and relieve symptoms of intermittent claudication.' "
What are the other causes of peripheral vascular diseases (PVD)?,"'A number of conditions such as ''vasculitis'' may cause damage to blood vessels throughout the body. Injuries to blood vessels (from accidents such as auto accidents or sports injuries), blood-clotting disorders, and damage to blood vessels during surgery can also lead to inadequate blood supply to body tissues (ischemia).''Tissue ischemia can also occur in the absence of atherosclerosis or other abnormalities of arteries. One example of a condition in which the blood vessels themselves are not damaged is '""Raynaud's disease""', which is believed to occur due to spasms in blood vessels brought on by ''stress'' or a ''cold'' environment.''Since atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries (PAD) is by far the most common cause of peripheral vascular disease, the rest of this article focuses upon peripheral artery disease.' "
Is there a test to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'The doctor will perform a physical exam and look for signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease, for example, weak or absent artery pulses in the extremities, bruits (sounds that can be heard through a stethoscope), ''blood pressure'' changes, and skin color and nail changes''In addition to the history of symptoms and the physical signs of peripheral artery disease imaging tests can be used in the diagnosis of the condition. Imaging tests include:' Doppler ultrasound - This form of ultrasound (measurement of high-frequency sound waves that are reflected off of tissues) that can detect and measure blood flow. Doppler ultrasound is used to measure blood pressures behind the knees and at the ankles. In patients with significant peripheral artery disease in the legs, the blood pressures in the ankles will be lower than the blood pressure in the arms (brachial blood pressure). The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a number derived from dividing the ankle blood pressure by the brachial blood pressure. An ankle-brachial index of 0.9 to 1.3 is normal, an ABI less than 0.9 indicate the presence of peripheral artery disease in the arteries in the legs, and an ABI below 0.5 usually indicates severe arterial occlusion in the legs. Duplex ultrasound - This is a color assisted non-invasive technique to study the arteries. Ultrasound probes can be placed on the skin overlying the arteries and can accurately detect the site of artery stenosis as well as measure the degree of obstruction. Angiography - An angiography is an imaging procedure to study the blood vessels of the extremities, similar to the way a coronary angiogram provides an image of the blood vessels supplying the heart. It is the most accurate test to detect the location(s) and severity of artery occlusion, as well as collateral circulations. Small hollow plastic tubes (catheters) are advanced from a small skin puncture at the groin (or the arm), under X-ray guidance, to the aorta and the arteries. Iodine contrast ""dye,"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Angiogram gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select patients for angioplasty or surgical bypass (see below). Because X-ray angiography is invasive with potential side effects (such as injury to blood vessels and contrast dye reactions), it is not used for initial diagnosis of peripheral artery disease. It is only used when a patient with severe peripheral artery disease symptoms is considered for angioplasty or surgery. A number of different imaging methods have been used in angiography examinations, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures and has the advantage of avoiding X-ray radiation exposure."
What are the management and treatment guidelines for peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Treatment goals for peripheral artery disease include:''Treatment of peripheral artery disease includes lifestyle measures, supervised exercises, medications, angioplasty, and surgery.''Proper exercise can condition the muscles to use oxygen effectively and can speed the development of collateral circulation. ''Clinical trials'' have shown that regular supervised exercise can reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication and allow individuals to walk longer before the onset of claudication. Ideally, your health care provider should prescribe an exercise program tailored to your specific needs.''Rehabilitation programs supervised by healthcare professionals such as nurses or physical therapists may help. Exercise at least three times a week, each session lasting longer than 30 to 45 minutes for the best results. Exercise usually involves walking on a monitored treadmill until claudication develops; walking time is then gradually increased with each session. Patients are also monitored for the development of chest pain or heart rhythm irregularities during exercise.'   Relieve the pain of intermittent claudication. Improve exercise tolerance by increasing the walking distance before the onset of claudication. Prevent critical artery occlusion that can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and amputation. Prevent heart attacks and strokes. Smoking cessation eliminates a major risk factor for disease progression, and it lowers the incidences of pain at rest and amputations. Smoking cessation also is important to prevent heart attacks and strokes. A healthy diet can help lower blood cholesterol and other lipid levels and may help control blood pressure. Keep other risk factors, such as diabetes, lipid levels, and blood pressure under control by following medical advice regarding medications and lifestyle changes."
Medications to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'While lifestyle changes may be enough treatment for some people with peripheral artery disease, others may require medication. Examples of medications used to treat peripheral artery disease include antiplatelet or anticlotting agents, cholesterol-lowering ''drugs'' such as ''statins'', medications that increase blood supply to the extremities such as ''cilostazol'' (''Pletal'') and ''pentoxifylline'' (''Trental''), and medications that control ''high blood pressure''.'  Antiplatelet medications (such as aspirin and clopidogrel [Plavix]) make the blood platelets less likely to stick to one another to form blood clots. Low-dose aspirin (81 to 325 mg/day) is usually prescribed indefinitely because it is also helpful in preventing strokes and heart attacks in patients with peripheral artery disease. Clopidogrel (Plavix) is an alternative to aspirin for those who are allergic or cannot tolerate aspirin. Antiplatelet medications also help prevent occlusion of blood vessels after angioplasty or bypass surgery. Anticoagulant medications act to prevent blood clotting. Both heparin and warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) are anticoagulant medications. Anticoagulants are sometimes prescribed for people with peripheral artery disease if they are at increased risk for formation of blood clots; these agents are used much less frequently than anti platelet agents in patients with peripheral artery disease. Cholesterol-lowering drugs of the statin class have been shown in numerous large clinical trials to help prevent heart attacks and strokes and prolong survival among patients with atherosclerosis. Statins have also been shown to slow the progression of peripheral artery disease, decrease arthrosclerosis in the arteries, and improve claudication symptoms. Cilostazol (Pletal) is a medication that can help increase physical activity (enabling one to walk a greater distance without the pain of claudication). Cilostazol works by causing dilation of the arteries and an increased supply of oxygenated blood to be delivered to the arms and legs. Cilostazol is recommended for some patients with claudication when lifestyle modifications and exercise are ineffective. Side effects are generally mild and include headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. Cilostazol should not be used in patients with heart failure because of concern over increased mortality in heart failure patients using medications similar to cilostazol. Pentoxifylline (Pentoxyl, Trental) improves blood flow to the extremities by decreasing the viscosity (""stickiness"") of blood, enabling more efficient blood flow. Side effects are fewer than with cilostazol, but its benefits are weaker and have not been conclusively proven by all studies. Drugs to control hypertension may also be prescribed. Current recommendations are to treat hypertension in patients with peripheral artery disease to prevent strokes and heart attacks."
Angioplasty to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'Angioplasty, also known as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, or PTA, is a nonsurgical procedure that can widen a narrowed or blocked artery. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery in the groin or arm and advanced to the area of narrowing. A tiny balloon on the tip of the catheter is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. This procedure is also commonly performed to dilate narrowed areas in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.''Sometimes the catheter technique is used to insert a ''stent'' (a cylindrical wire mesh tube) into the affected area of the artery to keep the artery open. In other cases, thrombolytic medications (medications that dissolve blood clots) may be delivered to the blocked area via a catheter.''Angioplasty does not require general anesthesia. Usually, a local anesthetic at the area of catheter insertion and a mild sedative are given. Major complications of angioplasty are rare, but can occur. These include damage to the artery or blood clot formation, excessive bleeding from the catheter insertion site, and abrupt vessel closure (blockage of the treated area occurring within 24 hours of the procedure).''Despite these risks, the overall incidence of complications is low and the benefits of angioplasty (no general anesthesia, no surgical incision, and the ability to return to normal activities within a couple of days) outweigh its risks. Usually a one-night hospital stay is required when angioplasty is performed.''Angioplasty is used when a patient has claudication that limits his or her activities and does not respond to exercise, medications, and lifestyle measures. Most doctors also recommend angioplasty when disease is very severe, and there is a focal, localized narrowing that is accessible via catheter. If a patient is too ill to have surgery and has severe ischemia (decreased oxygen in the tissues) that threatens loss of a limb, angioplasty may also be attempted.''Some cases of peripheral artery disease may be more difficult to treat by angioplasty. For example, blockages in multiple small arteries of the legs or blockages in extremely small vessels may not be treatable by this method.' "
Surgery to treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD),"'Surgical treatment for peripheral artery disease involves either bypass vascular surgery performed by a vascular surgeon or endarterectomy. Indications for surgical treatment of peripheral artery disease include lesions that, for anatomical reasons, may be difficult to treat by angioplasty. Examples include lesions covering long segments of a vessel, vessels with multiple narrowed areas, or long areas of narrowing. Bypass surgery involves using a vein from your body or a portion of synthetic vessel (known as grafts) to create a detour around the blockage. One end of the graft is sewn to the damaged artery above the blockage and the other end is sewn below the blocked area. Blood flow is then able to bypass the area of narrowing or blockage Bypass surgery is a major surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia and a hospital stay.''Endarterectomy is a procedure in which the surgeon cleans out plaque buildup inside the artery of the affected leg or arm.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'A number of different specialists may treat individuals with peripheral artery disease, for example, internists, family practitioners, or cardiologists may mange medication treatment. Interventional cardiologists or radiologists may perform angioplasty. Vascular surgeons may perform some surgical procedures to treat peripheral artery disease.' "
What are potential complications of peripheral artery disease (PVD)?,"'In rare cases, the decreased circulation to the extremities characteristic of peripheral artery disease can lead to open, non-healing sores, ulcers, gangrene, or other limb-threatening injuries to the extremities. The areas that do not receive adequate blood flow are also more prone to develop infections and, in extreme cases, amputation may be necessary.' "
How can I prevent from getting peripheral vascular disease (PVD)?,"'Peripheral vascular disease related to atherosclerosis can be prevented by minimizing the risk factors that are controllable, such as eating a heart-healthy ''diet'', maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, getting regular exercise, and maintaining good control of blood ''sugar'' levels if you have diabetes.' "
What is pseudoxanthoma elasticum?,"'The connective tissues are the structural portions of the body that essentially hold the body cells together. These tissues form a framework or matrix for the body, and are composed of two major structural molecules, collagen and elastin. There are many different collagen protein types which vary in abundance depending on body area. Elastin is another protein which has the capability of stretching and returning to original length like a spring.''Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare disorder of degeneration of the elastic fibers with tiny areas of calcification in the skin, back of the eyes (retinae), and blood vessels. Interestingly, while elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues which attach bone to bone), the ligaments are not apparently affected by PXE. ' "
How is pseudoxanthoma elasticum inherited?,"'PXE is inherited from the parents, either as an autosomal recessive or as an autosomal dominant trait. Identification of the gene responsible for PXE can facilitate the determination of the exact patterns of inheritance. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an inherited disorder of elastin.' "
What are symptoms of pseudoxanthoma elasticum?,"'PXE typically causes yellow-white small raised areas in the skin folds, often appearing in the second or third decades of life. These skin abnormalities frequently appear on the neck, armpits, and other areas that bend a great deal (referred to as flexure areas). The face is not affected by PXE. The doctor can often see abnormalities in the back of the eye (retinae) called angioid streaks, which are tiny breaks in the elastin-filled tissue there. These eye abnormalities can lead to ''blindness''.''Other areas that can be affected in PXE include the ''heart'' which can be affected by ''atherosclerosis'' and ''mitral valve prolapse''. Small blood vessels are abnormally fragile in patients with PXE because the blood vessel walls contain elastin and are weakened. This can lead to abnormal bleeding in such areas as the bowel and, very rarely, the uterus. Impairment of circulation to the legs can lead to pains in the legs while ''walking'' (''claudication'').' "
"What is the treatment for patients with pseudoxanthoma
elasticum?","'There is no cure for PXE. Treatment of patients with PXE involves monitoring organ function and consequences of the effects of the weakened elastin fibers in the body as well as measures to prevent injury and promote overall health.''For further information about Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, please visit the following site: ''PXE International: Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum''.' "
What is pycnodysostosis?,"'Pycnodysostosis is perhaps best known as the diagnosis given retrospectively to the late 19th century French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (portrayed by Jose Ferrer in the 1952 film ""Moulin Rouge"").''Pycnodysostosis is a genetic (inherited) disease of the bone. Its pattern of inheritance follows the classic rules of genetics (see below).''Pycnodysostosis consistently causes short stature. The height of adult males with the disease is less than 150 cm (59 inches, or 4 ''feet'' 11 inches). Adult females with pycnodysostosis are even shorter.''Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense (osteosclerosis); the last bones of the fingers (the distal phalanges) to be unusually short; and delays the normal closure of the connections (''sutures'') of the skull bones in infancy, so that the ""soft spot"" (the fontanel) on top of the head remains widely open.''Pycnodysostosis causes brittle bones which easily break (''fracture''). The bones in the legs and feet tend to fracture. The jaw and collar bone (clavicles) are also particularly prone to ''fractures''.''The precise frequency of pycnodysostosis has never been determined. Pycnodysostosis can be classified in the large group of genetic diseases that are individually uncommon, but collectively important because of the sum of their numbers, their heavy impact upon affected individuals, and the equally heavy burden they place upon their families.' "
What is basis for the name of this disease?,"'The name for this disease was coined by the French physicians Maroteauxand Lamy in 1962. They described the disorder in a report entitled ""Lapycnodysostose."" (They were not the only discoverers of the disease.Andren and colleagues independently described the condition in 1962.)Maroteaux and Lamy put ""pyknos,"" from the Greek meaning ""dense""together with the compound word ""dysostosis"" meaning abnormalbone formation. The name ""pycnodysostosis"" was designed toconvey the abnormally dense bone that is a hallmark of the disease.'""Although the original Maroteaux and Lamy spelling was with a 'c', it hasbeen written variably with a 'c' or a 'k'. Here we use the originalspelling with a 'c'. No matter which way it is spelt, the name has stuckand is utilized worldwide today to designate this disease."" "
What are the characteristics of pycnodysostosis?,"'Pycnodysostosis causes abnormalities other than short stature, densebrittle bones, short fingers, and the wide open soft spot of the skull(see above). These other abnormalities involve the head and face, ''teeth'',collar bones, skin, and nails. The front and back of the head areprominent. Within the open sutures of the skull, there may be many smallbones (called wormian bones). The midface is less full than usual. Thenose is prominent. The jaw can be small. The palate is narrow and grooved.The ''baby teeth'' are late coming in and may be lost much later than usual.The permanent ''teeth'' can also be slow to appear. The permanent teeth arecommonly irregular and teeth may be missing (hypodontia). The collar bonesare often underdeveloped and malformed. The skin over the back of thefingers is very wrinkled. The nails are flat and grooved.''Pycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time.Aside from the broken bones, the last bones of the fingers (the distalphalanges) and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration.Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally (resulting in ''scoliosis''). The tooth problems often require orthodontic care and dental ''cavities'' are common.' "
How is pycnodysostosis inherited?,'Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive condition. It is autosomal inthat the gene for pycnodysostosis is situated on one of the non-sexchromosomes (autosomes). Pycnodysostosis is recessive in that a singleedition of the pycnodysostosis gene is not enough to cause the disease.Two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent) must be present forthe disease to develop. The presence of a normal gene from one or bothparents prevents the disease.' 
What are the risks of pycnodysostosis?,"'Pycnodysostosis is a rare disease so that, if there is no family historyof the disease, the risk for a child to have pycnodysostosis isvery low.''However, with a inbred (consanguineous) union, the risk ofpycnodysostosis rises a little. This means that if one parent carries arare gene like that for pycnodysostosis, the chance that a mate of theirswho is actually related also carries the same rare gene is increasedcompared to an unrelated mate.''In a family with a child with pycnodysostosis, the risks are muchhigher. The parents of a child with pycnodysostosis have no signs of thedisease themselves but they each carry a single edition of thepycnodysostosis gene and, with a given ''pregnancy'', each has a half chanceof transmitting the pycnodysostosis gene (versus the normal paired gene).It is like tossing a coin. The chance for the child to havepycnodysostosis is one-half (from one parent) times one-half (from theother parent). The overall risk of pycnodysostosis in the offspring ofparents carrying the gene is, therefore, one-quarter (25%). Just as coinshave no memory of a prior toss, the 25% odds of having a pycnodysostosischild apply to every pregnancy conceived together by these parents,irrespective of the status of any of their other children.' "
What is the molecular story with pycnodysostosis?,"'In 1995, the gene for pycnodysostosis was first charted by Gelb andassociates. It was found to travel preferentially with gene markers knownto be in chromosome region 1q21. (This tendency for genes to traveltogether is termed linkage). Once the location of the pycnodysostosis genewas identified by linkage analysis, genes in that region that seemedlogical candidates were seriously scrutinized. Among them was cathepsin K,which is active in bone. Cathepsin K qualified as a ""candidate gene.""''In 1996, patients with pycnodysostosis were shown by Gelb and coworkersconsistently to have mutational changes in the gene for cathepsin K. Thedefective cathepsin K gene was thus demonstrated to be the generesponsible for pycnodysostosis. Pycnodysostosis is now clearly recognizedas being due to cathepsin K deficiency.''What does cathepsin K normally do? Cathepsin K is an enzyme (a catalystfor a reaction of body metabolism) of the type called a cysteine protease.This protease is important in cells of normal bone (osteoclasts) that areresponsible for bone reabsorption (or resorption). It is thought thatosteoclasts in patients with pycnodysostosis are hampered by a lack ofcathepsin K and cannot adequately reabsorb that component of bone calledthe organic matrix. (This process is essential for normal bonemaintenance; a process referred to as remodeling). Because of thisinadequate resorption, the bones in pycnodysostosis are abnormally denseand brittle.' "
"Could there be a connection between pycnodysostosis and
osteoporosis?","'Both pycnodysostosis and ''osteoporosis'' cause brittle bones. However,pycnodysostosis is a disease with abnormally dense bones, whereas''osteoporosis'' is exactly the opposite, a disease with washed-out porousbones. There would seem to be no conceivable connection betweenpycnodysostosis and ''osteoporosis''.''The new findings about cathepsin K and pycnodysostosis have made it clear that cathepsin K is a major protease in bone resorption. Given this function, it may well have a role in ''osteoporosis''. Cathepsin K may, in fact, provide a rational basis for a newapproach to the treatment of osteoporosis. This is an excellentillustration of how research on a rare disease may bring benefits to thoseaffected by a common disease.' "
What is the treatment for pycnodysostosis?,"'Bone fractures are a big problem for patients with pycnodysostosis. Theycan occur with minimal ''stress''. It is important that the disease bediagnosed and the tendency to fractures be recognized so that (1)fractures can be minimized, if not entirely prevented; and (2) the parentsand other caregivers are not falsely accused of ''child abuse''! As with anycondition causing brittle bones, the infant should be handled with areasonable degree of care. The older child should be encouraged to engagein safer forms of ''exercise'' such as ''swimming'' rather than, for example,jumping on a trampoline.''In 1996, Soliman and colleagues reported that there is defectivesecretion of growth hormone in pycnodysostosis. Replacement treatment withgrowth hormone was then tested. It was found to increase the growth of thelength of bones (linear growth). Since short stature is an importantconsequence of pycnodysostosis, growth hormone treatment may prove veryuseful.' "
