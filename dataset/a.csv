What is hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia is not one disease but rather one of a group of inherited ''bleeding disorders'' that cause abnormal or exaggerated bleeding and poor blood clotting. The term is most commonly used to refer to two specific conditions known as hemophilia A and ''hemophilia B'', which will be the main subjects of this article. Hemophilia A and B are distinguished by the specific gene that is mutated (altered to become defective) and codes for a defective clotting factor (protein) in each disease. Rarely, hemophilia C (a deficiency of Factor XI) is encountered, but its effect on clotting is far less pronounced than A or B.''Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an X-linked recessive genetic pattern and are therefore much more common in males. This pattern of inheritance means that a given gene on the X chromosome expresses itself only when there is no normal gene present. For example, a boy has only one X chromosome, so a boy with hemophilia has the defective gene on his sole X chromosome (and so is said to be hemizygous for hemophilia). Hemophilia is the most common X-linked ''genetic disease''.''Although it is much rarer, a girl can have hemophilia, but she would have to have the defective gene on both of her X chromosomes or have one hemophilia gene plus a lost or defective copy of the second X chromosome that should be carrying the normal genes. If a girl has one copy of the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and a normal second X chromosome, she does not have hemophilia but is said to be heterozygous for hemophilia (a carrier). Her male children have a 50% chance of inheriting the one mutated X gene and thus have a 50% chance of inheriting hemophilia from their carrier mother.''Hemophilia A occurs in about 1 out of every 5000 live male births. Hemophilia A and B occurs in all racial groups. Hemophilia A is about four times more common than B. B occurs in about 1 out of 20- 30,000 live male births.'""Hemophilia has been called the Royal Disease because Queen Victoria, Queen of England from 1837 to 1901, was a carrier. Her daughters passed the mutated gene on to members of the royal families of Germany, Spain, and Russia. Alexandra, Queen Victoria's granddaughter, who became Tsarina of Russia in the early 20th century when she married Tsar Nicholas II, was a carrier. Their son, the Tsarevich Alexei, suffered from hemophilia."" "
What causes hemophilia?,"'As mentioned above, hemophilia is caused by a genetic mutation. The mutations involve genes that code for proteins that are essential in the blood clotting process. The bleeding symptoms arise because blood clotting is impaired.''The process of blood clotting involves a series of complex mechanisms involving 13 different proteins, classically termed factors I through XIII and written with Roman numerals. If the lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged, platelets are recruited to the injured area to form an initial plug. These activated platelets release chemicals that start the clotting cascade, activating the series of 13 proteins known as clotting factors. Ultimately, fibrin is formed, the protein that crosslinks with itself to form a mesh that makes up the final ''blood clot''. The protein involved with hemophilia A is factor VIII (factor 8) and with hemophilia B is factor IX (factor 9).''Hemophilia A is caused by a mutation in the gene for factor VIII, so there is deficiency of this clotting factor. Hemophilia B (also called Christmas disease) results from a deficiency of factor IX due to a mutation in the corresponding gene.''A condition referred to as hemophilia C involves a deficiency of clotting factor XI. This condition is much rarer than hemophilia A and B and typically leads to mild symptoms. It is also not inherited in an X-linked manner and affects persons of both sexes.''Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B. About 80% of people with hemophilia have hemophilia A. Hemophilia B occurs in about 1 out of every 20,000 to 30,000 people. A subgroup of those with hemophilia B has the so-called Leyden phenotype, which is characterized by a severe hemophilia in childhood that improves at ''puberty''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia can vary in its severity, depending upon the particular type of mutation (genetic defect). The degree of symptoms depends upon the levels of the affected clotting factor. Severe disease is defined as <1% factor activity, 1% to 5% factor activity is moderate disease, and greater than 5% factor activity constitutes mild disease. The extent of bleeding is dependent upon the severity (the amount of factor activity) and is similar for hemophilia A and B.''With severe hemophilia (A or B), bleeding begins at an early age and may occur spontaneously. Those with mild hemophilia may only bleed excessively in response to injury or ''trauma''. Female carriers of hemophilia have variable degrees of factor activity; some may have near normal levels and do not show any bleeding tendencies, while some may have less than the predicted 50% reduction and may bleed more often than non-carrier females.''In severe hemophilia, bleeding episodes usually begin within the first 2 years of life. Heavy bleeding after ''circumcision'' in males is sometimes the first sign of the condition. Symptoms may develop later in those with moderate or mild disease. The bleeding of hemophilia can occur anywhere in the body. Common sites for bleeding are the joints, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Specific sites and types of bleeding are discussed below.'   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joints) is characteristic of hemophilia. The knees and ankles are most often affected. The bleeding causes distension of the joint spaces, significant pain, and over time, can be disfiguring. Over time, joint destruction occurs, and joint replacement surgeries can be required. Bleeding into the muscles may occur with hematoma formation (compartment syndrome). Bleeding from the mouth or nosebleeds may occur. Bleeding after dental procedures is common, and oozing of blood from the gums may occur in young children when new teeth are erupting. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can lead to blood in the stool. Bleeding from the urinary tract can lead to blood in the urine (hematuria). Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain or skull) can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or lethargy, and can lead to death. Increased bleeding after surgery or trauma is characteristic of hemophilia."
How is hemophilia diagnosed?,"'The majority of patients with hemophilia have a known family history of the condition. However, about one-third of cases occur in the absence of a known family history. Most of these cases without a family history arise due to a spontaneous mutation in the affected gene. Other cases may be due to the affected gene being passed through a long line of female carriers.''If there is no known family history of hemophilia, a series of blood tests can identify which part or protein factor of the blood clotting mechanism is defective if an individual has abnormal bleeding episodes.''The platelet (a blood particle essential for the clotting process) count and bleeding time test should be measured as well as two indices of blood clotting, the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). A normal ''platelet count'', normal PT, and a prolonged aPTT are characteristic of hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Specific tests for the blood clotting factors can then be performed to measure factor VII or factor IX levels and confirm the diagnosis.''Genetic testing to identify and characterize the specific mutations responsible for hemophilia is also available in specialized laboratories.'  "
Is it possible to know if you are a carrier of hemophilia?,"'Since men with the genetic mutation will have hemophilia, a man who does not have the condition cannot be a carrier of the disease. A woman who has a son with known hemophilia is termed an obligate carrier, and no testing is needed to establish that she is a carrier of hemophilia. ''Women whose carrier status is unknown can be evaluated either by testing for the clotting factors or by methods to characterize the mutation in the DNA. The DNA screening methods are generally the most reliable. ''Prenatal diagnosis'' is also possible with DNA-based tests performed on a sample obtained through ''amniocentesis'' or ''chorionic villus sampling''. Most individuals are seen and tested by consultants who specialize in genetically linked diseases.' "
What are treatments for hemophilia?,"'The mainstay of treatment is replacement of the blood clotting factors. Clotting factor concentrates can be purified from human donor blood or made in the laboratory using methods that do not use donor blood. This type of therapy is known as replacement therapy. Clotting factor replacement therapy is carried out by infusing the clotting factor concentrates into a vein, much like a ''blood transfusion''. This type of therapy can be administered at home with proper instruction and training.''Depending upon the severity of the condition, replacement therapy of the deficient clotting factor may be carried out on an as-needed basis (called demand therapy) or on a regular basis to prevent bleeding episodes (known as prophylactic therapy).''People who have mild cases of hemophilia A are sometimes treated with the drug desmopressin, also known as ''DDAVP''. This drug stimulates release of substances from platelets that help form the platelet plug. It is administered either slowly through the intravenous route (IV) or, occasionally, in nasal spray form.''Pain'' relievers may be prescribed for symptom relief, but ''pain'' relievers other than ''aspirin'' or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''naproxen'', ''ibuprofen'') must be used, since these types of ''drugs'"" further inhibit the blood's ability to clot. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) is often given for ''pain'' relief.'  "
Inhibitors,"'A major complication of treatment is the development of so-called inhibitors to the clotting factors. Inhibitors (antibodies) are produced because the body sees the factor concentrates used to treat patients to reduce or prevent bleeding, as foreign and activates an immune response in the patient to destroy the foreign substances (factor VIII or factor IX).''Inhibitors to factor VIII are the most common and occur in about one-third of those with severe hemophilia A and about 1 out of every 50 people with mild or moderate hemophilia A. They typically develop in childhood in those with severe hemophilia A and later in life in milder cases. Inhibitors destroy both the replacement factor VIII concentrates as well as any factor VIII that is present in the body. This is a serious complication of treatment because the factor concentrates are no longer effective in treating the condition. The action of inhibitors to destroy factor VIII concentrates shows different degrees of severity among individuals and can even vary over time in the same individual.''In about two-thirds of cases, the inhibitors disappear on their own or with treatment known as immune tolerance therapy (ITT) or immune tolerance induction (ITI). In cases of severe hemophilia A with persistence of inhibitors, other factor concentrates, such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, are administered to attempt to help control bleeding.''The development of inhibitors to factor IX is much less common and occurs in about 1% of those with hemophilia B. However, these can cause a very serious ''allergic reaction'' when factor IX concentrates are given. Immune tolerance therapy to eliminate inhibitors is less successful than with hemophilia A.' "
Infections,"'Blood-borne infections, such as the ''HIV'' virus and ''hepatitis B'' and C, were a major complication of treatment for hemophilia during the 1980s. These infections were transmitted through the factor concentrates and other blood products that were used to treat hemophilia. The use of large blood donor pools to prepare factor concentrates and the lack of specific tests for infectious agents both contributed to the contamination of blood products used to treat hemophilia. By 1985, about 90% of people with severe hemophilia were infected with the ''HIV'' virus, and about half of all people with hemophilia were ''HIV''-positive. Today, improved screening and manufacturing practices including virus removing techniques as well as the development of recombinant factors have essentially eliminated this tragic complication of treatment.' "
Can hemophilia be prevented?,"'Hemophilia is a genetic (inherited) disease and cannot be prevented. ''Genetic counseling'', identification of carriers through molecular genetic testing, and ''prenatal'' diagnosis are available to help individuals understand their risk of having a child with hemophilia.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for hemophilia?,"'Before factor concentrates were developed, those with hemophilia had a significantly decreased life expectancy. Life expectancy before the 1960s for those with severe hemophilia was limited to 11 years. Currently, the mortality (death) rate for males with hemophilia is twice that of healthy males. As mentioned before, the increase in ''HIV'' and ''hepatitis'' infections associated with therapy during the 1980s led to a corresponding increase in death rates.''Currently, prompt and adequate treatment can greatly reduce the risks of life-threatening bleeding episodes and the severity of long-term damage to joints, but joint deterioration remains a chronic complication of hemophilia.' "
What are possible future treatments for hemophilia?,"'Multiple trials and studies are underway to examine the possibility to use gene therapy to replace the defective genes in hemophilia. To date, stable and sustained production of the deficient clotting factors has not been achieved in humans, but this is an area of active investigation that holds great promise for the future.' "
What are the top ten phobias as per therapists?,"'As per research from therapists below are the top ten ''phobias''Apart from the above phobias, below are few more common phobias' Social phobia: Social anxiety disorder is fear of social interactions. It can make everyday activities challenging, stressful and anxiety provoking. Claustrophobia: This is the fear of enclosed spaces. People have difficulty breathing or a fear of running out of oxygen. It is believed that about 5% of the population suffers from claustrophobia. Zoophobia: An umbrella term that involves extreme fear of certain animals. Arachnophobia means fear of spiders. Ornithophobia means fear of birds. Ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes and apiphobia means the fear of bees. This fear is linked to an evolutionary response against these creatures, many of which are poisonous. Symptoms of this fear most often appear during childhood but can also develop in adulthood. Brontophobia: Fear of thunder and thunderstorms. Such people know that thunder cannot harm them but are still worried about going out during a thunderstorm. Acrophobia: This is a fear of heights. Acrophobia is believed to be partially ingrained, whether biologically or evolutionarily, as a survival mechanism. These people may develop attacks while climbing stairs and may be terrified to move. Blood, injury and injection (BII) phobia: Injury phobias are generally phobias associated with fear of medical procedures. They may often be associated with fainting and hyperventilation. These include hemophobia (fear of blood) and trypanophobia (fear of receiving an injection). Odontiatophobia is the fear of visiting a dentist. Aerophobia: This is the fear of flying. It can be passed down from parents if they are anxious flyers. It may be due to past experiences or even from watching media coverage of crashes. Atychiphobia: This is a fear of failure. When this fear becomes debilitating and one is unable to progress in life, it is time to seek help from a professional. Thanatophobia: This is a fear of death. As with atychiphobia, this fear is not shocking, but when it takes over day-to-day activities and causes anxiety that prevents seemingly normal activities and behavior, it becomes a serious problem. Nosophobia: This is a fear of developing a disease even if a person is having only minor symptoms. Emetophobia: This is a fear of vomiting. Vehophobia: This is a fear of driving. For most people who suffer from vehophobia, the phobia follows involvement in a car accident or after witnessing one.  Aquaphobia: This is a fear of water."
Is a phobia a mental disorder?,"'Yes, phobias are diagnosable mental disorders. A phobia is a strong, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. It is also a type of ''anxiety disorder''. A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity or a situation. People with phobias try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot, they may experience' Panic and fear Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Trembling A strong desire to get away Fainting in extreme cases"
What are the treatment options for phobias?,"'Phobias are highly treatable and people who have them are nearly always aware of their disorder. This helps diagnosis a great deal. Phobias are treated with a combination of therapy and medications which may include''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT''):''\xa0Gradual controlled exposure to the ""cause’ may help bring down the ''anxiety'' response.''Medications'' may help treat phobias''Medication therapy may cause a few common side effects which include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''dizziness'' and sometimes ''weight gain''. A doctor may prescribe the best medication with the least amount of side effects depending on the type of phobia.' Beta blockers: These medications reduce the palpitations and sweating that can accompany a phobia. Antidepressants: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affect serotonin levels in the brain, resulting in better moods. SSRIs include Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), celexa (citalopram) and others. Tranquilizers: Benzodiazepines are tranquilizers that might be prescribed for a phobia. These may help reduce anxiety symptoms Valium (diazepam)."
What is alopecia areata?,'Alopecia areata is an acquired skin disease that can affect all hair-bearing skin and is characterized by localized areas of non-scarring alopecia (''hair loss'').' Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other medical problems. Most often these bald areas regrow their hair spontaneously. Alopecia areata is rare before 3 years of age. There seems to be a significant inherited predisposition for the development of alopecia areata.
What causes alopecia areata?,"""Current evidence suggests that alopecia areata is caused by an abnormality in the immune system that damages hair follicles. This particular abnormality leads to autoimmunity, a misguided immune system that tends to attack its own body. As a result, the immune system attacks particular tissues of the body. In alopecia areata, for unknown reasons, the body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Biopsies of affected skin show immune lymphocytes penetrating into the hair bulb of the hair follicles."" Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other autoimmune conditions such asthyroid disease,vitiligo,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andulcerative colitis. thyroid disease, vitiligo, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis or treatment of these diseases is unlikely to affect the course of alopecia areata. Sometimes, alopecia areata occurs within family members, suggesting a role of genes."
What are the signs and symptoms of the different patterns of alopecia areata?,"   The most common pattern is one or more well-defined spots of hair loss on the scalp. If alopecia occurs in an ophiasis pattern (hair loss involving the temporal and posterior scalp) or if large areas of the scalp are involved for long periods of time, the prognosis is worse. A more generalized form of hair loss is referred to as diffuse alopecia areata where there is widespread dramatic thinning of the scalp hair. Occasionally, all of the scalp hair is entirely lost, a condition referred to as alopecia totalis. Less frequently, the loss of all of the hairs on the entire body, called alopecia universalis, occurs."
Who is affected by alopecia areata?," Alopecia areata tends to occur most often in adults 30 to 60 years of age. However, it can also affect older individuals and, rarely, young children. Alopecia areata is not contagious. It should be distinguished from hair shedding that may occur following the discontinuation of hormonal estrogen and progesterone therapies for birth control or the hair shedding associated with the end of pregnancy. There are a number of treatable conditions that could be confused with alopecia areata."
How do health care professionals diagnose alopecia areata?," The characteristic finding of alopecia areata is one or more well-circumscribed areas of otherwise normal, hairless skin in hair-bearing areas. Occasionally, it may be necessary to biopsy the scalp to confirm the diagnosis. Other findings that may be helpful are the appearance of short hairs that presumably represent fractured hairs, short thin hairs, and gray hair growing in a bald area. Other causes of hair loss are generally excluded from the consideration by history and clinical evaluation."
What is the treatment for alopecia areata?,"'The course of typical alopecia areata is not predictable with a high likelihood of spontaneous remission. The longer the period of time of hair loss and the larger the area involved, the less likely the hair will regrow spontaneously. Therefore, there are a variety of treatments, but none of these can confidently be predicted to impact the course of this disease.'   Local steroid injections intracutaneously may be very helpful in restarting the hair growth cycle in treated areas. Steroid creams, lotions, and shampoos have been used for many years but are of limited benefit at best. Although oral systemic steroids are known to induce hair growth in affected patients, their long-term use is contraindicated because of the likelihood of undesirable side effects. The topical sensitizers, diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutylester, have been used in those suffering from recalcitrant alopecia areata or those with more than 50% hair loss. The goal of treatment is to create an allergic contact dermatitis of the scalp. This alteration in the immune response occasionally is accompanied by hair regrowth. The efficacy of the topical sensitizers has been demonstrated in both young children and adults, but it probably works less than half the time. Recent success using oral janus kinase inhibitors, including tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, and baricitinib, have been shown to be efficacious in severe, extensive alopecia areata in adults, but long-term therapy has potential side effects. The durability of response to these medications is variable, and most patients experience recurrence of hair loss after discontinuation. Perhaps topical therapy with these types of drugs may be available in the near future. There is no known effective method of prevention, although the elimination of emotional stress is felt to be helpful. No drugs or hair care products have been associated with the onset of alopecia areata. Although not precisely a treatment, the cosmetic camouflage of alopecia areata is certainly an important consideration in patient management. The damaging emotional effect of significant hair loss for both women and men can be considerable."
Facts you should know about abdominal aortic aneurysms,"'What is the medical definition of ''aortic'' ''aneurysm''?''What is the most common cause of ''abdominal aortic aneurysm''?''What are the symptoms of a leaking ''aortic aneurysm''?''How do you check for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?' An aneurysm is an abnormal area of localized widening of a blood vessel. The aorta bulges at the site of an aneurysm like a weak spot on a worn tire. Aortic aneurysms are typically spindle-shaped and involve the aorta below the arteries to the kidneys. The most common cause of an aneurysm is arteriosclerosis. Smoking is a major risk factor. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often do not cause symptoms. If they do, they may cause deep boring pain in the lower back or flank. Prominent abdominal pulsations may be present. X-rays of the abdomen and other radiologic tests including ultrasound, CT, and MRI may be used in diagnosing and monitoring the aneurysm. Rupture of an aortic aneurysm is a catastrophe. Repair of an aneurysm can be done by surgery or endovascular stenting."
What is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Threatened rupture of abdominal aneurysms is a surgical emergency. Once an aneurysm ruptures, 50% of those with the aneurysm die before they reach the hospital. The longer it takes to get to the operating room, the higher the mortality.'  "
What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'An aneurysm is an area of a localized widening (dilation) of a blood vessel. The word ""aneurysm"" is borrowed from the Greek ""aneurysma"" meaning ""a widening."" An aortic aneurysm involves the aorta, the major artery that leaves the ''heart'' to supply blood to the body. An aortic aneurysm is a dilation or bulging of the aorta.''Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere along the length of the aorta but the majority are located in the abdominal aorta. Most of these abdominal aneurysms are located below the level of the renal arteries, the vessels that provide blood to the kidneys. Abdominal aortic aneurysms can extend into the iliac arteries.''The inside walls of aneurysms are often lined with a ''blood clot'' that forms because there is stagnant blood. The wall of an aneurysm is layered, like a piece of plywood.''The aorta is the large artery that exits the heart and delivers blood to the body. It begins at the ''aortic valve'' that separates the ''left ventricle'' of the heart from the aorta and prevents blood from leaking back into the heart after a contraction, when the heart pumps blood. The various sections of the aorta are named based upon the relation to the heart and the location in the body. Thus, the beginning of the aorta is referred to as the ''ascending aorta'', followed by the arch of the aorta, then the ''descending aorta''. The portion of the aorta that is located in the chest (thorax) is referred to as the thoracic aorta, while the abdominal aorta is located in the abdomen. The abdominal aorta extends from the ''diaphragm'' to the mid-abdomen where it splits into the iliac arteries that supply the legs with blood.'  "
What are the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Most abdominal aortic aneurysms produce no symptoms (they are asymptomatic) and are discovered incidentally when an imaging test of the abdomen (''CT scan'' or ultrasound) is performed. They can also be detected by physical examination when the health care professional feels the abdomen and listens for a bruit, the sound made by turbulent blood flow.''Pain'' is the most common symptom when the aneurysm expands or ruptures. It often begins in the central abdomen and radiates to the back or flank. Other symptoms can occur depending upon where the aneurysm is located in the aorta and whether nearby structures are affected.''Abdominal aortic aneurysms can remain asymptomatic or produce minimal symptoms for years. However, a rapidly expanding abdominal aneurysm can cause sudden onset of severe, steady, and worsening middle abdominal and back or flank pain. Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be catastrophic, even lethal, and is associated with abdominal distension, a pulsating abdominal mass, and ''shock'' due to massive blood loss.'  "
What are the causes of abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'The most common cause of aortic aneurysms is ""''hardening of the arteries''"" called arteriosclerosis. A majority of aortic aneurysms are caused by arteriosclerosis. The arteriosclerosis can weaken the aortic wall and the increased pressure of the blood being pumped through the aorta causes ''weakness'' of the inner layer of the aortic wall.''The aortic wall has three layers, the tunica adventitia, tunica media, and tunica intima. The layers add strength to the aorta as well as elasticity to tolerate changes in ''blood pressure''. Chronically increased blood pressure causes the media layer to break down and leads to the continuous, slow dilation of the aorta.''Smoking'' is a major cause of aortic aneurysm. Studies have shown that the rate of aortic aneurysm has fallen at the same rate as population ''smoking'' rates.' Genetic/hereditary: Genetics may play a role in developing an aortic aneurysm. The risk of having an aneurysm increases if a first-degree relative also has one. The aneurysm may present at a younger age and is also at a higher risk of rupture. Genetic disease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome are two connective tissue diseases that are associated with the development of aortic aneurysm. Abnormalities of the connective tissue in the layers of the aortic wall can contribute to weakness in sections of the aorta. Post-trauma: Trauma can injure the aortic wall and cause immediate damage or it may cause an area of weakness that will form an aneurysm over time. Arteritis: Inflammation of blood vessels as occurs in Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis, and relapsing polychondritis can contribute to aneurysm. Mycotic (fungal) infection: A mycotic or fungal infection may be associated with immunodeficiency, IV drug abuse, syphilis, and heart valve surgery."
What size are most abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Most aortic aneurysms are fusiform. They are shaped like a spindle (""fusus"" means spindle in Latin) with widening all around the circumference of the aorta. (Saccular aneurysms just involve a portion of the aortic wall with a localized out pocketing).' "
Who gets abdominal aortic aneurysms? Are they genetic?,"'Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to occur in white males over the age of 60. In the United States, these aneurysms occur in up to 3.0% of the population. Aneurysms start to form at about age 50 and peak at age 80. Women are less likely to have aneurysms than men and African Americans are less likely to have aneurysms than Caucasians.''There is a genetic component that predisposes one to developing an aneurysm; the prevalence in someone who has a first-degree relative with the condition can be as high as 25%.''Collagen vascular diseases that can weaken the tissues of the aortic walls are also associated with aortic aneurysms. These diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.' "
What are risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'The risk factors for aortic aneurysm are the same as those for ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease'' and include:' Cigarette smoking: This not only increases the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but also increases the risk of aneurysm rupture. Aortic rupture is a life-threatening event where blood escapes the aorta and the patient can quickly bleed to death. High blood pressure Elevated blood cholesterol levels Diabetes mellitus"
How do medical professionals diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Physical examination can be the initial way the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is made. The health care professional may be able to feel a pulsatile mass in the center of the abdomen and make the clinical diagnosis. In ''obese'' patients with a large girth, physical exam is less helpful. In very thin patients, the aorta can often be seen to pulsate under the skin and this may be a normal finding. Listening with a stethoscope may also reveal a bruit or abnormal sound from turbulence of blood within the aneurysm.''In most cases, X-rays of the abdomen show calcium deposits in the aneurysm wall. But plain X-rays of the abdomen cannot determine the size and the extent of the aneurysm.''Ultrasonography'' usually gives a clear picture of the size of an aneurysm. Ultrasound has about 98% accuracy in measuring the size of the aneurysm and is safe and noninvasive.''CT scan of the abdomen is highly accurate in determining the size and extent of the aneurysm and its location in the aorta. To help plan repair, if needed, it is important to know whether the aneurysm is above or below where the renal arteries branch off to go to the kidneys and whether the aneurysm extends towards the chest or down into the iliac arteries into the legs. ''CT scans'' require dye to be injected to evaluate the blood vessels (including the aorta). People with ''kidney disease'' or dye ''allergies'' may not be candidates for CT. MRI/MRA (''magnetic resonance imaging'' and arteriography) may be an alternative.''An aortogram, an X-ray study where dye is directly injected into the aorta, was the test of choice, but CT and MRI have taken its place.' "
What is the treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Abdominal aortic aneurysms gradually expand over time. The larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture and death. Small aneurysms can be observed and followed with repeated ultrasounds or other imaging.''Guidelines for following an aneurysm are as follows:' A normal aorta measures up to 1.7 cm in a male and 1.5 cm in a female. Aneurysms that are found incidentally or by accident that are less than 3.0 cm do not need to be re-evaluated or followed. Aneurysms measuring 3.0 to 4.0 cm should be rechecked by ultrasound every year to monitor for potential enlargement and dilation. Aneurysms measuring 4.0 to 4.5 cm should be monitored every 6 months by ultrasound. Aneurysms measuring greater than 4.5 cm should be evaluated by a surgeon for potential repair."
What is abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery?,"'Each patient is different and the decision to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm depends upon the size of the aneurysm, the age of the patient, underlying medical conditions, and life expectancy.''There are two approaches for repair:''The approach to treatment needs to be tailored to the individual patient and very much depends upon the location, size, and shape of the aneurysm.'   The first is the traditional surgical approach. A large incision is made in the abdomen, the aortic aneurysm is identified and cut out or resected. The missing piece of aorta is replaced with a synthetic graft. The second approach is placing an endovascular graft. A catheter or tube is threaded into the femoral artery in the groin and the graft is positioned so that it spans and sits inside the aneurysm and protects it from expanding (endovascular: endo = inside + vascular = blood vessel)."
What is the nonsurgical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Once an aneurysm is detected, the goal is to try to prevent it from enlarging. Life-long control of risk factors is a must and includes the following:' Stopping cigarette smoking. Controlling high blood pressure: Beta blocker medications may be used to control both blood pressure and to decrease the pressure within the aneurysm. Controlling blood cholesterol. Keeping diabetes under control. Routine monitoring of the size of the aneurysm:A normal aorta measures up to 1.7 cm in a male and 1.5 cm in a female.Aneurysms that are found incidentally or by accident that are less than 3.0 cm do not need to be re-evaluated or followed.Aneurysms measuring 3.0 to 4.0 cm should be rechecked by ultrasound every year to monitor for potential enlargement and dilation.Aneurysms measuring 4.0 to 4.5 cm should be monitored every 6 months by ultrasound.Aneurysms measuring greater than 4.5 cm should be evaluated by a surgeon for potential repair.

What are the complications with an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"""An aortic aneurysm can leak causing an increase in the patient's ""'abdominal pain''. When pain is felt in the back or flank, the symptoms can be misdiagnosed as a ''kidney stone''.

What are abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. Normally, internal tissues and organs have slippery surfaces, preventing them from sticking together as the body moves. However, abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal ''cavity'' to stick together.''The abdominal ''cavity'' is the internal area of the body between the chest and hips that contains the lower part of the ''esophagus'', stomach, small intestine, and ''large intestine''. The ''esophagus'' carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach, which slowly pumps them into the small and large ''intestines''. Abdominal adhesions can kink, twist, or pull the small and large ''intestines'' out of place, causing an intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction, also called a bowel obstruction, results in the partial or complete blockage of movement of food or ''stool'' through the intestines.' "
What causes abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. Surgery related causes include''Rarely, abdominal adhesions form without apparent cause.'   cuts involving internal organs handling of internal organs drying out of internal organs and tissues contact of internal tissues with foreign materials, such as gauze, surgical gloves, and stitches blood or blood clots that were not rinsed away during surgery Abdominal adhesions can also result from inflammation not related to surgery, includingappendix ruptureradiation treatmentgynecological infectionsabdominal infections appendix rupture radiation treatment gynecological infections abdominal infections"
How common are abdominal adhesions and who is at risk?," Of patients who undergo abdominal surgery, 93 percent develop abdominal adhesions. Surgery in the lower abdomen and pelvis, including bowel and gynecological operations, carries an even greater chance of abdominal adhesions. Abdominal adhesions can become larger and tighter as time passes, sometimes causing problems years after surgery."
What are the symptoms of abdominal adhesions?,"   In most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common."
Seek help for emergency symptoms,'A complete intestinal obstruction is life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction include''severe ''abdominal pain'' or cramping'   nausea vomiting bloating loud bowel sounds abdominal swelling the inability to have a bowel movement or pass gas constipation - a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week; the bowel movements may be painful A person with these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.
What are the complications of abdominal adhesions?,"'Abdominal adhesions can cause intestinal obstruction and female ''infertility'' - the inability to become ''pregnant'' after a year of trying.' Abdominal adhesions can lead to female infertility by preventing fertilized eggs from reaching the uterus, where fetal development takes place. Women with abdominal adhesions in or around their fallopian tubes have an increased chance of ectopic pregnancy - a fertilized egg growing outside the uterus. Abdominal adhesions inside the uterus may result in repeated miscarriages - a pregnancy failure before 20 weeks."
How are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions diagnosed?,"'Abdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ''ultrasound''. Most abdominal adhesions are found during surgery performed to examine the abdomen. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions.'   Abdominal x rays use a small amount of radiation to create an image that is recorded on film or a computer. An x ray is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. An x ray does not require anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The person may be asked to change position for additional pictures. A lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or an enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the person’s anus. The large intestine is filled with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. The person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken."
How are abdominal adhesions and intestinal obstructions treated?,"'Abdominal adhesions that do not cause symptoms generally do not require treatment. Surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause ''pain'', intestinal obstruction, or ''fertility'' problems. More surgery, however, carries the risk of additional abdominal adhesions. People should speak with their health care provider about the best way to treat their abdominal adhesions.''Complete intestinal obstructions usually require immediate surgery to clear the blockage. Most partial intestinal obstructions can be managed without surgery.'  "
How to prevent abdominal adhesions,"'Abdominal adhesions are difficult to prevent; however, certain surgical techniques can minimize abdominal adhesions.''Laparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision. The surgeon inserts a laparoscope - a thin tube with a tiny video camera attache - into one of the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor. Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery.''If laparoscopic surgery is not possible and a large abdominal incision is required, at the end of surgery a special filmlike material can be inserted between organs or between the organs and the abdominal incision. The filmlike material, which looks similar to wax paper and is absorbed by the body in about a week, hydrates organs to help prevent abdominal adhesions.''Other steps taken during surgery to reduce abdominal adhesions include' using starch- and latex-free gloves handling tissues and organs gently shortening surgery time using moistened drapes and swabs occasionally applying saline solution"
Facts you should know about abdominal aortic aneurysms,"'What is the medical definition of ''aortic'' ''aneurysm''?''What is the most common cause of ''abdominal aortic aneurysm''?''What are the symptoms of a leaking ''aortic aneurysm''?''How do you check for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?' An aneurysm is an abnormal area of localized widening of a blood vessel. The aorta bulges at the site of an aneurysm like a weak spot on a worn tire. Aortic aneurysms are typically spindle-shaped and involve the aorta below the arteries to the kidneys. The most common cause of an aneurysm is arteriosclerosis. Smoking is a major risk factor. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often do not cause symptoms. If they do, they may cause deep boring pain in the lower back or flank. Prominent abdominal pulsations may be present. X-rays of the abdomen and other radiologic tests including ultrasound, CT, and MRI may be used in diagnosing and monitoring the aneurysm. Rupture of an aortic aneurysm is a catastrophe. Repair of an aneurysm can be done by surgery or endovascular stenting."
What is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Threatened rupture of abdominal aneurysms is a surgical emergency. Once an aneurysm ruptures, 50% of those with the aneurysm die before they reach the hospital. The longer it takes to get to the operating room, the higher the mortality.'  "
What is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'An aneurysm is an area of a localized widening (dilation) of a blood vessel. The word ""aneurysm"" is borrowed from the Greek ""aneurysma"" meaning ""a widening."" An aortic aneurysm involves the aorta, the major artery that leaves the ''heart'' to supply blood to the body. An aortic aneurysm is a dilation or bulging of the aorta.''Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere along the length of the aorta but the majority are located in the abdominal aorta. Most of these abdominal aneurysms are located below the level of the renal arteries, the vessels that provide blood to the kidneys. Abdominal aortic aneurysms can extend into the iliac arteries.''The inside walls of aneurysms are often lined with a ''blood clot'' that forms because there is stagnant blood. The wall of an aneurysm is layered, like a piece of plywood.''The aorta is the large artery that exits the heart and delivers blood to the body. It begins at the ''aortic valve'' that separates the ''left ventricle'' of the heart from the aorta and prevents blood from leaking back into the heart after a contraction, when the heart pumps blood. The various sections of the aorta are named based upon the relation to the heart and the location in the body. Thus, the beginning of the aorta is referred to as the ''ascending aorta'', followed by the arch of the aorta, then the ''descending aorta''. The portion of the aorta that is located in the chest (thorax) is referred to as the thoracic aorta, while the abdominal aorta is located in the abdomen. The abdominal aorta extends from the ''diaphragm'' to the mid-abdomen where it splits into the iliac arteries that supply the legs with blood.'  "
What are the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Most abdominal aortic aneurysms produce no symptoms (they are asymptomatic) and are discovered incidentally when an imaging test of the abdomen (''CT scan'' or ultrasound) is performed. They can also be detected by physical examination when the health care professional feels the abdomen and listens for a bruit, the sound made by turbulent blood flow.''Pain'' is the most common symptom when the aneurysm expands or ruptures. It often begins in the central abdomen and radiates to the back or flank. Other symptoms can occur depending upon where the aneurysm is located in the aorta and whether nearby structures are affected.''Abdominal aortic aneurysms can remain asymptomatic or produce minimal symptoms for years. However, a rapidly expanding abdominal aneurysm can cause sudden onset of severe, steady, and worsening middle abdominal and back or flank pain. Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm can be catastrophic, even lethal, and is associated with abdominal distension, a pulsating abdominal mass, and ''shock'' due to massive blood loss.'  "
What are the causes of abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'The most common cause of aortic aneurysms is ""''hardening of the arteries''"" called arteriosclerosis. A majority of aortic aneurysms are caused by arteriosclerosis. The arteriosclerosis can weaken the aortic wall and the increased pressure of the blood being pumped through the aorta causes ''weakness'' of the inner layer of the aortic wall.''The aortic wall has three layers, the tunica adventitia, tunica media, and tunica intima. The layers add strength to the aorta as well as elasticity to tolerate changes in ''blood pressure''. Chronically increased blood pressure causes the media layer to break down and leads to the continuous, slow dilation of the aorta.''Smoking'' is a major cause of aortic aneurysm. Studies have shown that the rate of aortic aneurysm has fallen at the same rate as population ''smoking'' rates.' Genetic/hereditary: Genetics may play a role in developing an aortic aneurysm. The risk of having an aneurysm increases if a first-degree relative also has one. The aneurysm may present at a younger age and is also at a higher risk of rupture. Genetic disease: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome are two connective tissue diseases that are associated with the development of aortic aneurysm. Abnormalities of the connective tissue in the layers of the aortic wall can contribute to weakness in sections of the aorta. Post-trauma: Trauma can injure the aortic wall and cause immediate damage or it may cause an area of weakness that will form an aneurysm over time. Arteritis: Inflammation of blood vessels as occurs in Takayasu disease, giant cell arteritis, and relapsing polychondritis can contribute to aneurysm. Mycotic (fungal) infection: A mycotic or fungal infection may be associated with immunodeficiency, IV drug abuse, syphilis, and heart valve surgery."
What size are most abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Most aortic aneurysms are fusiform. They are shaped like a spindle (""fusus"" means spindle in Latin) with widening all around the circumference of the aorta. (Saccular aneurysms just involve a portion of the aortic wall with a localized out pocketing).' "
Who gets abdominal aortic aneurysms? Are they genetic?,"'Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to occur in white males over the age of 60. In the United States, these aneurysms occur in up to 3.0% of the population. Aneurysms start to form at about age 50 and peak at age 80. Women are less likely to have aneurysms than men and African Americans are less likely to have aneurysms than Caucasians.''There is a genetic component that predisposes one to developing an aneurysm; the prevalence in someone who has a first-degree relative with the condition can be as high as 25%.''Collagen vascular diseases that can weaken the tissues of the aortic walls are also associated with aortic aneurysms. These diseases include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.' "
What are risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'The risk factors for aortic aneurysm are the same as those for ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease'' and include:' Cigarette smoking: This not only increases the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but also increases the risk of aneurysm rupture. Aortic rupture is a life-threatening event where blood escapes the aorta and the patient can quickly bleed to death. High blood pressure Elevated blood cholesterol levels Diabetes mellitus"
How do medical professionals diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Physical examination can be the initial way the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm is made. The health care professional may be able to feel a pulsatile mass in the center of the abdomen and make the clinical diagnosis. In ''obese'' patients with a large girth, physical exam is less helpful. In very thin patients, the aorta can often be seen to pulsate under the skin and this may be a normal finding. Listening with a stethoscope may also reveal a bruit or abnormal sound from turbulence of blood within the aneurysm.''In most cases, X-rays of the abdomen show calcium deposits in the aneurysm wall. But plain X-rays of the abdomen cannot determine the size and the extent of the aneurysm.''Ultrasonography'' usually gives a clear picture of the size of an aneurysm. Ultrasound has about 98% accuracy in measuring the size of the aneurysm and is safe and noninvasive.''CT scan of the abdomen is highly accurate in determining the size and extent of the aneurysm and its location in the aorta. To help plan repair, if needed, it is important to know whether the aneurysm is above or below where the renal arteries branch off to go to the kidneys and whether the aneurysm extends towards the chest or down into the iliac arteries into the legs. ''CT scans'' require dye to be injected to evaluate the blood vessels (including the aorta). People with ''kidney disease'' or dye ''allergies'' may not be candidates for CT. MRI/MRA (''magnetic resonance imaging'' and arteriography) may be an alternative.''An aortogram, an X-ray study where dye is directly injected into the aorta, was the test of choice, but CT and MRI have taken its place.' "
What is the treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"'Abdominal aortic aneurysms gradually expand over time. The larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture and death. Small aneurysms can be observed and followed with repeated ultrasounds or other imaging.''Guidelines for following an aneurysm are as follows:' A normal aorta measures up to 1.7 cm in a male and 1.5 cm in a female. Aneurysms that are found incidentally or by accident that are less than 3.0 cm do not need to be re-evaluated or followed. Aneurysms measuring 3.0 to 4.0 cm should be rechecked by ultrasound every year to monitor for potential enlargement and dilation. Aneurysms measuring 4.0 to 4.5 cm should be monitored every 6 months by ultrasound. Aneurysms measuring greater than 4.5 cm should be evaluated by a surgeon for potential repair."
What is abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery?,"'Each patient is different and the decision to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm depends upon the size of the aneurysm, the age of the patient, underlying medical conditions, and life expectancy.''There are two approaches for repair:''The approach to treatment needs to be tailored to the individual patient and very much depends upon the location, size, and shape of the aneurysm.'   The first is the traditional surgical approach. A large incision is made in the abdomen, the aortic aneurysm is identified and cut out or resected. The missing piece of aorta is replaced with a synthetic graft. The second approach is placing an endovascular graft. A catheter or tube is threaded into the femoral artery in the groin and the graft is positioned so that it spans and sits inside the aneurysm and protects it from expanding (endovascular: endo = inside + vascular = blood vessel)."
What is the nonsurgical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"'Once an aneurysm is detected, the goal is to try to prevent it from enlarging. Life-long control of risk factors is a must and includes the following:' Stopping cigarette smoking. Controlling high blood pressure: Beta blocker medications may be used to control both blood pressure and to decrease the pressure within the aneurysm. Controlling blood cholesterol. Keeping diabetes under control. Routine monitoring of the size of the aneurysm:A normal aorta measures up to 1.7 cm in a male and 1.5 cm in a female.Aneurysms that are found incidentally or by accident that are less than 3.0 cm do not need to be re-evaluated or followed.Aneurysms measuring 3.0 to 4.0 cm should be rechecked by ultrasound every year to monitor for potential enlargement and dilation.Aneurysms measuring 4.0 to 4.5 cm should be monitored every 6 months by ultrasound.Aneurysms measuring greater than 4.5 cm should be evaluated by a surgeon for potential repair.

What are the complications with an abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"""An aortic aneurysm can leak causing an increase in the patient's ""'abdominal pain''. When pain is felt in the back or flank, the symptoms can be misdiagnosed as a ''kidney stone''. If the diagnosis is missed or if the patient does not present for care, the aneurysm can burst or rupture causing potential catastrophe and death.''Drugs'' in the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics rarely may cause aortic aneurysms to rupture in some people, according to the FDA.''Since aneurysms are associated with ''atherosclerosis'' and plaque along the aortic wall and since aneurysms often contain a clot, debris can travel, or embolize, into smaller blood vessels and cause symptoms due to decreased blood flow.''Aneurysms can rarely become infected.'

What is abdominal migraine?,"'Like adults, children can develop migraines. This can be the same type of condition seen in adults, which is typically occurs with a ''headache'', and is sometimes preceded by an aura. ''Nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''photophobia'' (decreased tolerance to light) can occur. Children also develop some unusual and atypical variations of migraine, not associated with ''headaches'' in particular, that are not usually observed in adults. Abdominal migraine is one of these variants. ''Abdominal migraine is a condition thought to be related to migraine that is characterized by pain in the abdomen. It is often precipitated by the usual triggers of classic migraine. The pain can be severe, and nausea and vomiting can occur. ''Abdominal migraine is rare in adults, but it has been estimated that up to 2% of all children may develop abdominal migraines. Children who have the condition usually go on to develop migraine ''headaches'' as adults. Girls are affected more frequently than boys. Abdominal migraine typically occurs for the first time between the ages of 2 and 10.'  "
What causes abdominal migraine?,"'The cause of abdominal migraine is poorly understood. Abdominal migraine is thought by some researchers to be related to neurologic or endocrinologic changes and may be caused by alterations in the levels of ''serotonin'' and histamine in the body. Genetic factors may also be involved as the condition is more common in children who have a family history of migraine. About 60% of children with the condition have a positive family history for migraine. ''Triggers for abdominal migraine have been described, similar to triggers for classic migraine. These include ''chocolate'' or nitrite-containing foods, ''stress'', and ''anxiety''.' "
What are the symptoms of abdominal migraine?,"'As mentioned, abdominal migraine causes pain in the abdomen that can be severe and debilitating. It is typically located in the middle portion of the belly, often around the umbilicus. Cramping, nausea, and vomiting can accompany the pain. Pallor (paleness) of the skin is often observed. There may not be associated ''headache''. The symptoms are usually relieved by ''sleep'' and can last anywhere from one hour to several days.' "
How is abdominal migraine diagnosed?,"'Because of the frequent absence of ''headache'', the condition can be difficult to diagnose, especially during the first episode. There is no specific test that can establish the diagnosis of abdominal migraine, so the diagnosis is based on exclusion of other conditions. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are usually directed to rule out other conditions that could be responsible for the symptoms. Electroencephalography (''EEG'') is sometimes done to rule out a''seizure'' disorder as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What is the treatment for abdominal migraine?,"'The treatment of abdominal migraine has two components - to reduce symptoms of an acute attack and to prevent or lessen the severity of future episodes. Research to date has not provided sufficient data to firmly establish the role of any particular medication in either treating symptoms or preventing future episodes of abdominal migraine. Still, many patients respond to anti-migraine medications and other medications.' "
Medications to treat abdominal migraine,"'Types of medications that may be used to manage abdominal migraine include:''Other aspects of treatment may include the administration of intravenous fluids if vomiting is severe, and the use of sedatives or antiemetic drugs.''Treatment may also include advice to recognize and avoid triggers, if these are known. For example, if food triggers have been identified, these should be avoided, although not all those who experience abdominal migraine have identifiable food triggers. ''Stress management'' and relaxation programs may be of benefit to some.' Analgesic drugs, such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or
	acetaminophen Sumatriptan 
	(Imitrex, Alsuma), a member of the triptan 
class of drugs used to treat migraine in adults, has been used to treat some 
older children with abdominal migraine 
Tricyclic antidepressants and drugs 
that block the effects of serotonin have been used in some patients to decrease 
frequency of attacks. Valproic acid (Depakote), an 
antiseizure medication, has been used to treat abdominal migraine. Ergotamine medications, also used for 
adults with migraine, are used to treat some childhood variants of migraine. Low dose aspirin and 
	low dose 
beta-blocker medications have been used over the long term in some patients in 
an attempt to diminish the frequency of future attacks. The antihistamine cyproheptadine has 
been shown to be effective in some children with migraine variants."
What is the prognosis for abdominal migraine?,"'The prognosis for abdominal migraine is good; most children eventually stop having the attacks of ''abdominal pain''. However, most children (about 70% in one study of 54 children) who have abdominal migraine go on to develop migraines in adulthood.' "
What is abdominal pain?,"'Abdominal pain'' is felt in the abdomen. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs and ''diaphragm'' above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal ''cavity'' (such as the skin and muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe discomfort originating from organs within the abdominal ''cavity''. Organs of the abdomen include the stomach, small intestine, colon, ''liver'', gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas.''Technically, the lowermost portion of the area described previously, is the pelvis, which contains the urinary bladder and rectum, as well as the ''prostate gland'' in men, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries in women. Often, it can be difficult to know if lower abdominal pain is coming from the lower abdomen or pelvis (''pelvic pain'').''Occasionally, pain may be felt in the belly even though it is arising from organs that are close to, but not within, the abdominal cavity, for example, conditions of the lower ''lungs'', the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. On the other hand, it also is possible for pain from organs within the belly to be felt outside of the it. For example, the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back. These latter types of pain are described as ""referred” because it does not originate in the location that it is felt. Rather, the cause is located away from where it is felt (i.e., it is referred to a different area).''Picture of the organs and glands in the abdomen.' "
What causes abdominal pain?,"'Abdominal pain is caused by inflammation of an organ (for example, ''appendicitis'', ''diverticulitis'', ''colitis''), by stretching or distention of an organ (for example, obstruction of the intestine, blockage of a bile duct by ''gallstones'', swelling of the liver with ''hepatitis''), or by loss of the supply of blood to an organ (for example, ischemic colitis).''To complicate matters, however, abdominal pain also can occur without inflammation, distention or loss of blood supply. An important example of the latter is the ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''). It is not clear what causes the belly pain in ''IBS'', but it is believed to be due either to abnormal contractions of the intestinal muscles (for example, spasm) or abnormally sensitive nerves within the ''intestines'' that give rise to painful sensations inappropriately (visceral hyper-sensitivity). This often is referred to as functional pain because no recognizable specific abnormality to account for the cause of the pain has been found - at least not yet.'

"Signs, symptoms, locations, types, and severity of abdominal pain","'Doctors will ask you a variety of questions about your belly pain in order to help find the possible causes of it, for example:'   If it comes on suddenly, this may suggest a problem with an organ within the belly; for example, the interruption of the supply of blood to the colon (ischemia) or obstruction of the bile duct by a gallstone (biliary colic). Appendicitis typically causes discomfort in the middle of the abdomen, and then moves to the right lower abdomen, the usual location of the appendix. Diverticulitis typically causes discomfort in the left lower abdomen where most colonic diverticuli are located. Discomfort from the gallbladder (biliary colic or cholecystitis) typically is felt in the middle, upper abdomen or the right upper abdomen near where the gallbladder is located. Is it severe, crampy, steady; or does it wax and wane? Obstruction of the intestine initially causes waves of crampy pain due to contractions of the intestinal muscles and distention of the intestine. True cramp-like pain suggests vigorous contractions of the intestines. Obstruction of the bile ducts by gallstones typically causes steady (constant) upper belly pain that lasts between 30 minutes and several hours. Acute pancreatitis typically causes severe, unrelenting, steady pain in the upper abdomen and upper back. The pain of acute appendicitis initially may start near the umbilicus, but as the inflammation progresses, it moves to the right lower abdomen. The character of pain may change over time. For example, obstruction of the bile ducts sometimes progresses to inflammation of the gallbladder with or without infection (acute cholecystitis). When this happens, the characteristics change to those of inflammatory pain. The discomfort of IBS typically waxes and wanes over months or years and may last for years or decades. Biliary colic lasts no more than several hours. The pain of pancreatitis lasts one or more days. The pain of acid-related diseases - gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or duodenal ulcers - typically occurs over a period of weeks or months that is worse followed by periods of weeks or months during which it is better (periodically). Functional pain may show this same pattern of periodicity. Pain due to inflammation (appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis) typically is aggravated by sneezing, coughing or any jarring motion. Individuals with inflammation prefer to lie still. What health conditions make abdominal pain worse or better? The pain of IBS and constipation often is relieved temporarily by bowel movements and may be associated with changes in bowel habit. Pain due to obstruction of the stomach or upper small intestine may be relieved temporarily by vomiting which reduces the distention that is caused by the obstruction. Eating or taking antacids may temporarily relieve ulcer pain from the stomach or duodenum because both food and antacids neutralize the acid that is responsible for irritating the ulcers and causing the pain. Pain that awakens a patient from sleep is more likely to be due to non-functional causes and is more significant. Other associated symptoms that accompany abdominal pain may suggest: Fever suggests inflammation or infection. Diarrhea or rectal bleeding suggests an intestinal cause. Fever and diarrhea suggest inflammation of the intestines that may be infectious or non-infectious. How is the cause of abdominal pain diagnosed? Doctors determine the cause of the pain by relying on: Its characteristics, physical signs, and other accompanying symptoms Findings on physical examination Medical laboratory, radiological, and endoscopic testing Surgery"

   Characteristics, physical signs, and other accompanying symptoms Findings on physical examination Laboratory, radiological, and endoscopic testing Surgery"
What exams and tests help diagnose the cause of abdominal pain?,"'Examining the patient will provide the doctor with additional clues to the cause of the pain. The doctor will determine:''For example:''While the health history and physical examination are vitally important in determining the cause of abdominal pain, other medical tests often are necessary to determine the cause.''Laboratory tests such as the ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), ''liver enzymes'', pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), ''pregnancy test'' and ''urinalysis'' are frequently ordered.''Plain ''X-rays'' of the abdomen also are referred to as a KUB (because they include the kidney, ureter, and bladder). The KUB may show enlarged loops of intestines filled with copious amounts of fluid and air when there is ''intestinal obstruction''. Patients with a perforated ulcer may have air escape from the stomach into the abdominal cavity. The escaped air often can be seen on a KUB on the underside of the diaphragm. Sometimes a KUB may reveal a calcified ''kidney stone'' that has passed into the ureter and resulted in referred abdominal pain or calcifications in the pancreas that suggest ''chronic pancreatitis''.''Surgery''. Sometimes, diagnosis requires examination of the abdominal cavity either by ''laparoscopy'' or surgery.' The presence of sounds coming from the intestines that occur when there is obstruction of the intestines, The presence of signs of inflammation (by special maneuvers during the examination), The location of any tenderness The presence of a mass within the abdomen that suggests a tumor, enlarged organ, or abscess (a collection of infected pus) The presence of blood in the stool that may signify an intestinal problem such as an ulcer, colon cancer, colitis, or ischemia. Finding tenderness and signs of inflammation in the left lower abdomen often means that diverticulitis is present, while finding a tender (inflamed) mass in the same area may mean that the inflammation has progressed and that an abscess has formed. Finding tenderness and signs of inflammation in the right lower abdomen often means that appendicitis is present, while finding a tender mass in the same area may mean that the inflammation has progressed and that an abscess has formed. Inflammation in the right lower abdomen, with or without a mass, also may be found in Crohn's disease. (Crohn's disease most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine, usually located in the right lower abdomen.) A mass without signs of inflammation may mean that a cancer is present. An elevated white count suggests inflammation or infection (as with appendicitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, or colitis). A low red blood cell count may indicate a bleed in the intestines. Amylase and lipase (enzymes produced by the pancreas) commonly are elevated in pancreatitis. Liver enzymes may be elevated with gallstone attacks or acute hepatitis. Blood in the urine suggests kidney stones. When there is diarrhea, white blood cells in the stool suggest intestinal inflammation or infection. A positive pregnancy test may indicate an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus). Ultrasound is useful in diagnosing gallstones, cholecystitis appendicitis, or ruptured ovarian cysts as the cause of the pain. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen is useful in diagnosing pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, as well as in diagnosing abscesses in the abdomen. Special CT scans of the abdominal blood vessels can detect diseases of the arteries that block the flow of blood to the abdominal organs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in diagnosing many of the same conditions as CT tomography. Barium X-rays of the stomach and the intestines (upper gastrointestinal series or UGI with a small bowel follow-through) can be helpful in diagnosing ulcers, inflammation, and blockage in the intestines. Computerized tomography (CT) of the small intestine can be helpful in diagnosing diseases in the small bowel such as Crohn's disease. Capsule enteroscopy, uses a small camera the size of a pill swallowed by the patient, which can take pictures of the entire small bowel and transmit the pictures onto a portable receiver. The small bowel images can be downloaded from the receiver onto a computer to be inspected by a doctor later. Capsule enteroscopy can be helpful in diagnosing Crohn's disease, small bowel tumors, and bleeding lesions not seen on x-rays or CT scans. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD is useful for detecting ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), or stomach cancer. Colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy is useful for diagnosing infectious colitis, ulcerative colitis, or colon cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is useful for diagnosing pancreatic cancer or gallstones if the standard ultrasound or CT or MRI scans fail to detect them. Balloon enteroscopy, the newest technique allows endoscopes to be passed through the mouth or anus and into the small intestine where small intestinal causes of pain or bleeding can be diagnosed, biopsied, and treated."
How does IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) cause abdominal pain?,"'As previously mentioned, the discomfort of ''irritable bowel'' syndrome is due either to abnormal intestinal muscle contractions or visceral hypersensitivity. Generally, abnormal muscle contractions and visceral hypersensitivity are much more difficult to diagnose than other diseases or other health conditions, particularly since there are no typical abnormalities on physical examination or the usual diagnostic tests. The diagnosis is based on the history (typical symptoms) and the absence of other cause.' "
"Foods, natural remedies, and OTC treatments for certain causes of abdominal pain","'If you aren’t sure if you need to seek medical advice for belly pain, contact your doctor or other health care professional before using any home remedies.''Common home remedies and ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines include:''Some health care professionals recommend:''Some of these may help reduce symptoms, but if symptoms persist, seek medical care. Beware of ""cures"" advertised as a single treatment that can cure all causes of this problem because no such remedy or cure exists.''Taking ''aspirin'' or ''NSAIDs'' should be avoided until the cause of the pain is diagnosed because the medications could make some causes worse (for example, peptic ulcers, intestinal bleeding).' Eat less food Take small amounts of baking soda Use lemon and/or lime juice Start a BRAT diet (banana, rice, applesauce and toast) for a day or so for symptom relief. Don’t smoke or drink alcohol. Taking ginger Peppermint Licorice Chamomile tea Medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), loperamide (Imodium), ranitidine (Zantac) and other over-the-counter substances"
Why can diagnosis of the cause of abdominal pain be difficult?,"'Modern advances in technology have greatly improved the accuracy, speed, and ease of establishing the cause of belly pain, but significant challenges remain. There are many reasons why diagnosing the cause of it can be difficult.' For example, the pain of appendicitis sometimes is located in the right upper abdomen, and of diverticulitis on the right side. Elderly patients and those taking corticosteroids may have little or no pain and tenderness when there is inflammation, for example, with cholecystitis or diverticulitis. This occurs because corticosteroids reduce the inflammation. Ultrasound examinations can miss gallstones, particularly small ones. CT scans may fail to show pancreatic cancer, particularly small ones. The KUB can miss the signs of intestinal obstruction or stomach perforation. Ultrasounds and CT scans may fail to demonstrate appendicitis or even abscesses, particularly if the abscesses are small. The CBC and other blood tests may be normal despite severe infection or inflammation, particularly in individuals receiving corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system. IBS symptoms can mimic bowel obstruction, cancer, ulcer, gallbladder attacks, or even appendicitis. Crohn's disease can mimic appendicitis. Infection of the right kidney can mimic acute cholecystitis. A ruptured right ovarian cyst can mimic appendicitis; while a ruptured left ovarian cyst can mimic diverticulitis. Kidney stones can mimic appendicitis or diverticulitis. Examples discussed previously include the extension of the inflammation of pancreatitis to involve the entire abdomen and the progression of biliary colic to cholecystitis."
What medications can be used to treat certain causes of abdominal pain?,"'Medications that are used for the treatment of underlying cause(s) of the pain are the medications of choice. For example, medications are not needed for the treatment of simple viral ''gastroenteritis'' (''stomach flu'' or stomach bug), while surgery and/or ''chemotherapy'' may be the best approach to treat certain ''cancers'' in the abdomen. Other causes may require antispasmodics, antimicrobials, H2 blockers, or even ''nitrates'' or morphine. The diagnosed cause usually narrows the choice of medications. A few causes can only be treated by surgery (for example incarcerated ''hernia'', ''abdominal adhesions'' from previous surgeries, and certain abdominal injuries), although some medications may be used (for example, morphine) while the person is waiting to have surgery.'  "
What lifestyle choices can I make to prevent abdominal pain?,"'Lifestyle changes really depend on the cause of the pain.' Eat a healthy diet, exercise, and avoid smoking and excess alcohol consumption to reduce the chances that you will experience certain causes. Good hygiene, especially hand washing and avoiding materials and foods contaminated with viruses and bacteria will reduce your chances of developing illness from many infectious causes."
When should I call my doctor about abdominal pain?,"'Some doctors suggest that if you have a ""less serious"" cause of abdominal pain you likely won’t need to see a doctor if the symptoms resolve in about 24 to 48 hours. For example, if you have viral or bacterial ''food poisoning'', have had discomfort, but aren’t dehydrated.''If you have a chronic problem that occasionally causes abdominal discomfort, most doctors suggest you contact the person treating you for the ailment for an appointment or prescription (refill). However, if you have any of the problems or symptoms listed in the ""serious abdominal pain ""section above, you should seek immediate medical care.' "
Introduction,"""Are sit-ups just not giving you the taut tummy you desire? If you've got a little too much flab or excess skin in your abdomen that won't diminish with ""'diet'' or ''exercise'', you may want to consider an abdominoplasty, popularly referred to as a ""tummy tuck.""''This procedure flattens your abdomen by removing extra fat and skin, and tightening muscles in your abdominal wall.'""However, this is a major surgery. So if you're considering it, take the time to educate yourself, thoroughly analyze your own situation and do not rush to make the final decision.""'A tummy tuck should be the last resort for people who have exhausted all other measures, and the procedure should not be used as an alternative to ''weight loss''.' "
Who Are the Best Candidates For a Tummy Tuck?,"'A tummy tuck is suitable for both men and women who are in good overall general health.''It should not be confused with a  ''liposuction''  (the ''cosmetic surgery'' used to remove fat deposits), although your surgeon may elect to perform liposuction as part of a tummy tuck.''Women who have muscles and skin stretched by multiple ''pregnancies'' may find the procedure useful to tighten those muscles and reduce that skin. A tummy tuck is also an alternative for men or women who were ''obese'' at one point in their lives and still have excessive fat deposits or loose skin in the abdominal area.' "
Who Should Not Consider a Tummy Tuck?,"""If you're a woman who is still planning to have children, then you may want to postpone a tummy tuck until you're through bearing children. Here's why: During surgery, your vertical muscles are tightened. Future pregnancies can separate these muscles.""'Are you still planning to lose a lot of weight? If so, you do not want to consider a tummy tuck.'""It's important to note that a tummy tuck can cause prominent, permanent scarring. If this is something you don't want, you may want to reconsider. Your doctor will discuss all these options with you when you go for the consultation."" "
How a Tummy Tuck is Done,"'Depending on your desired results, this surgery can take anywhere from one to five hours. The complexity of your particular situation also will determine whether you have it completed as an in-patient or outpatient procedure.''You will receive general anesthesia, which will put you to ''sleep'"" during the operation. It's important to have someone with you who can drive you home. If you live alone, you also will need someone to stay with you at least the first night after the surgery.""'There are two options for a tummy tuck. You and your surgeon will discuss your desired results, and he or she will determine the appropriate procedure during your consultation.''Complete abdominoplasty.'' Your abdomen will be cut from hipbone to hipbone in this procedure, the option for those patients who require the most correction. The incision will be made low, at about the same level as your pubic hair.''Your surgeon will then manipulate and contour the skin, tissue and muscle as needed. Your ''belly button'"" will have a new opening if you undergo this procedure, because it's necessary to free your navel from surrounding tissue. Drainage tubes may be placed under your skin and these will be removed in a few days as your surgeon sees fit.""'Partial or mini abdominoplasty.'' Mini-abdominoplasties are often performed on patients whose fat deposits are located below the navel and require shorter incisions. ''During this procedure, your belly button most likely will not be moved. Your skin will be separated between the line of incision and your belly button. This type of surgery may also be performed with an endoscope (small camera on the end of a tube). The procedure may only take up to two hours, again, depending on your own personal situation and the complexity of your needs.' "
How to Prepare For Tummy Tuck Surgery,"'If you smoke, you will have to stop for a certain period as determined by your doctor. It is not enough to just cut down on ''smoking''. You must stop completely for at least two weeks prior to surgery and for two weeks after. ''Smoking'' can increase the risk of complications and delay healing.''Make sure you eat well-balanced, complete meals and do not try to ''diet'' excessively before the surgery. Proper ''nutrition'' plays a key role in healing properly. ''If you take certain medications, your surgeon may instruct you to stop taking these for a certain period before and after the surgery. Your surgeon will determine this as part of your pre-operative consultation.'""Before undergoing the surgery, you'll need to get your home ready for your post-operative care. Your home recovery area should include:""'You know yourself best, so make sure you set up the safest, most comfortable recovery area before you undergo the surgery to meet your personal needs.' Plenty of ice packs Supply of loose, comfortable clothing that can be taken on and off very easily Petroleum jelly for incision sites Telephone within reaching distance Hand-held shower head and bathroom chair"
What Are the Complications and Side Effects of Tummy Tuck Surgery?,"'As expected, you will have ''pain'' and swelling in the days following surgery. Your doctor can prescribe a painkiller, if needed, and will instruct you on how to best handle the ''pain''. Soreness may last for several weeks or months.''You may also experience numbness, ''bruising'' and overall ''tiredness'' for that same time period.'""As with any surgery, there are risks. Remember, this surgery affects a very crucial part of your body. Though they're rare, complications can include infection, bleeding under the skin flap or ""'blood clots'' that could travel to your lung and interfere with your ''breathing''. You may carry an increased risk of complications if you have poor circulation, ''diabetes'' or ''heart'', lung or ''liver disease'' or a history of blood clots.''You may experience insufficient healing, which can cause more significant scarring or loss of skin. If you do heal poorly, you may require a second surgery.''As we mentioned before, the ''scars'"" from a tummy tuck are fairly prominent and though they may fade slightly, they will never completely disappear. Your surgeon may recommend certain creams or ointments to use after you've completely healed to help with the scars."" "
Taking Care of Yourself After Surgery,"""Whether you're having a partial or complete tummy tuck, your incision site will be stitched and bandaged. It's very important that you follow all your surgeon's instructions on how to care for the bandage in the days following surgery. The bandage used will be a firm, elastic band that promotes proper healing. Your surgeon will also instruct you on how to best position yourself while sitting or lying down to help ease pain.""'If you are an exceptionally physically active person,you will have to severely limit strenuous ''exercise'' for at least six weeks. Your doctor will advise you on this as you go through the process. You may need to take up to one month off of work after the surgery to ensure proper recovery. Again, your doctor will help you determine this based on your personal situation.' "
Return to Living,"""Generally, most people love the new look after they've undergone this procedure. However, you may not feel like your normal self for months after the surgery. You've gone through a tremendous amount to make this happen, both emotionally and physically, and it's very important that you follow proper diet and exercise to maintain your new look."" "
Does Insurance Cover a Tummy Tuck?,"'Insurance carriers generally do not cover elective, ''cosmetic surgery''. However, your carrier may cover a certain percentage if you have a ''hernia'' that will be corrected through the procedure, or your anterior muscles are abnormally spread.'""It's extremely important that you begin communicating with your insurance company early on, and that you discuss your insurance concerns with your surgeon. In most cases, your surgeon will write a letter to your insurance carrier, making the case for medical necessity, if it applies to you.""""It's also very important to realize that insurance may only cover certain portions of the surgery, so make sure you get details. With any cosmetic surgery, this may affect future insurance coverage for you and your premiums may increase.""'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of ''Plastic Surgery''.''Edited by  Charlotte E.

Introduction to treating arrhythmias with ablation,"'Ablation is used to treat ''abnormal heart rhythms'', or arrhythmias. The type of ''arrhythmia'' and the presence of other ''heart disease'' will determine whether ablation can be performed surgically or non-surgically.''Non-surgical ablation'', used for many types of arrhythmias, is performed in a special lab called the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory. During this non-surgical procedure a catheter is inserted into a specific area of the ''heart''. A special machine directs energy through the catheter to small areas of the heart muscle that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy ""disconnects"" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm. It can also be used to disconnect the electrical pathway between the upper chambers (atria) and the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.''Surgical ablation'' procedures used for treating ''atrial fibrillation'' can be ""minimally invasive"" or traditional ""open"" surgery and may be combined with other surgical therapies such as bypass surgery, valve repair, or valve replacement. Surgical ablation procedures include:' The Maze procedure. During this traditional open-heart surgical procedure, the surgeon makes small cuts in the heart to interrupt the conduction of abnormal impulses and to direct normal sinus impulses to travel to the atrioventricular node (AV node) as they normally should. When the heart heals, scar tissue forms and the abnormal electrical impulses are blocked from traveling through the heart. Minimally invasive surgical ablation. Unlike traditional heart surgery, there is no large chest wall incision and the heart is not stopped. These techniques utilize smaller incisions and endoscopes (small, lighted instruments that contain a camera). 
 The modified Maze procedure. The surgeon uses a special catheter to deliver energy that creates controlled lesions on the heart and ultimately scar tissue. This scar tissue blocks the abnormal electrical impulses from being conducted through the heart and promotes the normal conduction of impulses through the proper pathway. One of four energy sources may be used to create the scars: radiofrequency, microwave, laser, or cryothermy (cold temperatures). The modified Maze procedure involves a single incision in the left atrium."
Why do I need ablation therapy?,"'Doctors recommend ablation therapy to treat:''In addition to re-establishing a normal heart rhythm in people with certain arrhythmias, ablation therapy can help control the heart rate in people with rapid arrhythmias, and reduce the risk of ''blood clots'' and ''strokes''.'   Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter AV Nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) Accessory pathways Ventricular tachycardia"
How should I prepare for catheter ablation?,"""The ablation preparation may vary, depending on whether you're having surgical or nonsurgical ablation. These are general guidelines; your doctor or nurse will give you specific instructions.""'To prepare for ablation, there are several steps you should take. Among them:' Ask your doctor which medications you should stop taking and when to stop them. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain drugs (such as those that control your heart rate or blood thinners including aspirin products) one to five days before your procedure. If you are diabetic, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetic medications. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the procedure. If you must take medications, drink only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home."
What can I expect during catheter ablation?,"'During nonsurgical catheter ablation, the following things will occur:''The procedure usually takes about four to eight hours, but may take longer.' The procedure will take place in a special room called the EP (electrophysiology) lab. Before the test begins, a nurse will help you get ready. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an IV (intravenous) line in your hand or arm. This is so the doctors and nurses can give you medications and fluids through your vein during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to help you relax. Depending on the type of ablation you have, you may or may not be awake during your procedure. If you are awake, you will be asked to report any symptoms, answer questions, or follow instructions given to you by your doctor. If you are uncomfortable or need anything, please let your nurse know. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. 
 After you become drowsy, your groin area will be shaved and your neck, upper chest, arm, and groin will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes will be placed to cover you from your neck to your feet. 
 The doctor will numb the insertion site by injecting a medication. You will feel an initial burning sensation, and then it will become numb. Then, several catheters (special wires that can pace the heart and record its electrical activity) will be inserted through a small incision into a large blood vessel(s) and/or artery (in your groin, neck, or arm) and advanced to your heart. If you are awake, it is important that you remain still and resist the temptation to raise your head to see what the doctor is doing while the catheters are being placed. 
 After the catheters are in place, the doctor will look at the monitor to assess your heart's conduction system. 
 Then, the doctor will perform the ablation procedure. 
 During traditional ablation, the doctor will use a pacemaker-like device to send electrical impulses to the heart to increase your heart rate. You may feel your heart beating faster or stronger when the pacemaker delivers the impulses. If your arrhythmia occurs during the procedure, the nurse will ask you how you are feeling. It is very important to tell the doctor or nurse the symptoms you feel. The doctor will then move the catheters around your heart to see which area(s) your arrhythmia is coming from. Once the doctor finds the area of your arrhythmia, energy is applied. You may feel some discomfort or a burning sensation in your chest, but you must stay quiet, keep very still, and avoid taking deep breaths. If you are feeling pain, ask your doctor or nurse to give you more medication. 
 During pulmonary vein ablation (for atrial fibrillation), the doctor delivers energy through a catheter to the area of the atria that connects to the pulmonary vein (ostia), producing a circular scar. The scar will then block any impulses firing from within the pulmonary veins, thus preventing atrial fibrillation from occurring. The process is repeated to all four pulmonary veins. In some cases, ablation may also be performed to other parts of the heart such as the subclavian veins and coronary sinus. The catheter is a special ""cool tip"" catheter. Fluid circulates through the catheter to help control the intensity of the temperature. 
 Once the ablation is complete, the electrophysiologist will use monitoring devices to observe the electrical signals in the heart to ensure that the abnormal heart rhythm was corrected. 
"
What happens after catheter ablation?,"'After your nonsurgical catheter ablation:''If you have any other questions, please ask your doctor or nurse. Ask your health care provider how often you will need to go for follow-up appointments.' The doctor will remove the catheters from your groin and apply pressure to the site to prevent bleeding. You will be on bed rest for one to six hours. Keep your legs as still as possible during this time to prevent bleeding. 
 After your procedure, you may be admitted to the hospital. During your recovery, a special monitor, called telemetry, will be used to follow your heart rate and rhythm. Telemetry consists of a small box connected by wires to your chest with sticky electrode patches. The box allows your heart rhythm to be displayed on several monitors on the nursing unit. The nurses will be able to observe your heart rate and rhythm. In most cases, you will be able to go home the next day after the catheter ablation procedure but in some cases you may be able to go home the same day of the procedure. 
 You and your family will receive the results of the procedure afterwards. Your doctor will also discuss when you can resume activities and how often you will need to visit your doctor. 
 Temporarily, many individuals experience heart palpitations on and off for a few weeks after the procedure. Sometimes you may also feel as if your abnormal heart rhythm is returning, but then it stops. These sensations are normal and you should not be alarmed. When these symptoms occur during your recovery, it is important to document them by calling your doctor or nurse as directed. Also call your doctor or nurse if you feel as if your abnormal heart rhythm has recurred. 
 You may be required to take medications for a certain period of time after your procedure.

How should I care for the wound site?,"'You will have a small dressing on your ''wound''. It may be removed the next day. Keep the area clean and dry.''Call your doctor if you notice any redness, swelling, or drainage at the incision site.' "
What can I expect during surgical ablation?,"'During surgical ablation, you can expect the following:' General anesthesia (the patient is asleep) or local anesthesia with sedation (the patient is awake but relaxed and pain-free) may be used, depending on the individual case. During minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon views the outer surface of the heart using an endoscope. Specialized instruments are used to locate the areas needing ablation and to create the lines of conduction block. Unlike traditional heart surgery, there is no large chest wall incision, and the heart is not stopped. The Maze procedure requires an incision along the sternum (breast bone). The incision may be traditional (about 6 to 8 inches long), or in some cases, minimally invasive (about 3 to 5 inches long). The heart is stopped during this procedure. A heart-lung machine oxygenates the blood and circulates it throughout the body during surgery. The modified Maze procedure involves using one of four different energy sources to create the lines of conduction block (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, or cryothermy). The energy probe of choice is inserted, and under direct vision, used to create the lesion lines. As in the classic Maze procedure, these lesions create lines of conduction block that interrupt the abnormal impulses and restore the normal sinus rhythm. This procedure is used primarily in patients who have atrial fibrillation and other indications for surgery."
What happens after surgical ablation?,"'If your ablation surgery was combined with valve, bypass, or another surgical procedure, your post-procedure care may be different.''After surgical ablation:''Medications after surgery may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' The patient is usually transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring for about one to two days after the surgery. When the patient's condition is stable, he or she is transferred to a regular nursing unit (called a telemetry unit). The monitoring during recovery includes heart, blood pressure, and blood oxygen monitoring and frequent checks of vital signs and other parameters, such as heart sounds. Most patients stay in the hospital about 5 to 7 days after the procedure, depending on their rate of recovery. Patients who had minimally invasive surgery may be able to go home 2 to 3 days after surgery. Your health care team will follow your progress and help you recover as quickly as possible. Full recovery from surgery takes about 6 to 8 weeks. Most patients are able to drive in about 3 to 8 weeks after surgery. Your health care team will provide specific guidelines for your recovery and return to work, including specific instructions on activity, incision care, and general health after the surgery. Many patients may experience skipped heartbeats or short episodes of atrial fibrillation during the first three months after the procedure. This is common due to inflammation (swelling) of the heart tissue and is treated with medications. After the heart has healed, these abnormal heartbeats should subside. A small number of patients require a pacemaker after surgery due to an underlying abnormal rhythm which previously was undetected. Anticoagulants (blood thinners), such as Coumadin, to prevent blood clots. Antiarrhythmic medication to control abnormal heartbeats. Diuretics to reduce fluid retention. Your doctor will monitor your recovery and determine when or if these medications can be discontinued."

What is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)?,"'When the ''heart'""'s electrical system malfunctions, the normal rhythm of the heart can be affected. Depending upon the abnormality, the heart may begin to beat too fast, too slow, irregularly, or not at all. Heart rhythm disorders are often referred to as cardiac arrhythmias (cardiac = heart; a = lack of) but this is technically incorrect, since in most cases there is a heart rhythm, but it is abnormal. Cardiac dysrhythmia (dys = abnormal or faulty + rhythm) might be a better term.""'Dysrhythmias may occur because of problems directly associated with the electrical ""wiring,"" the SA node, the ''AV node'', or ventricular conducting system. The issue may also be due to influences on the conducting system from outside the heart. These can include ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the bloodstream, abnormal hormone levels (for example thyroid function that is too high or too low), and medication or drug ingestions.''Any abnormality of the electrical cycle within the heart that generates an abnormal beat, whether it is too fast, too slow, skipped, or irregular is considered a dysrhythmia.''Dysrhythmias are usually classified as originating from above the ''AV node'' (supraventricular ) or below, from the ventricle. They are either fast, slow, or irregular and persistent or intermittent.' "
How does the heart work?,"'The heart is a two-stage electric pump whose job it is to circulate blood through the body. The initial electrical impulse that begins the process of a heartbeat is generated by a group of cells located in the upper chamber of the heart, the ''atrium''. These cells act as an automatic ''pacemaker'', starting the electric signal that spreads along the ""wiring"" within the heart muscle, allowing a coordinated squeeze so that the pump can function.''The heart has four chambers. The upper chambers are the right and left atria (singular = ''atrium'') while the lower chambers are the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the ''lungs'' while the left side pumps it to the rest of the body.''Blood from the body depleted of oxygen and containing carbon dioxide is collected in the ''right atrium'' and then pushed into the ''right ventricle'' with a small beat of the upper chamber of the heart. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release the carbon dioxide. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the ''left atrium'' where the small atrial beat pushes it to the ''left ventricle''. The left ventricle is much thicker than the right because it needs to be strong enough to send blood to the entire body.''There are special cells in the right ''atrium'' called the sinoatrial node (SA node) that generate the first electrical impulse, allowing the heart to beat in a coordinated way. The SA node is considered the ""natural pacemaker"" of the heart. This pacemaker function begins the electrical impulse, which follows pathways in the atrial walls, almost like wiring, to a junction box between the atrium and ventricle called the ''atrioventricular node'' (''AV node''). This electric signal causes muscle cells in both atria to contract at once. At the AV node, the electric signal waits for a very short time, usually one- to two-tenths of a second, to allow blood pumped from the atria to fill up the ventricles. The signal then passes through electric bundles in the ventricle walls to allow these chambers to contract, again in a coordinated way, and pump blood to the lungs and body.''The SA node generates an electric beat about 60 to 80 times a minute, and each should result in a heartbeat. That beat can be felt as an external pulse. After a heartbeat, the muscle cells of the heart need a split second to get ready to beat again, and the electrical system allows a pause for this to happen.''The heart and its electrical activity work within a narrow range of normal. Fortunately, the body tends to protect the heart as best as it can. Rhythm disturbances may be normal physiologic responses, but some may be potentially life threatening.''Every cell in the heart can act as a pacemaker. A healthy SA node has an intrinsic heart beat generation rate of 60 to 80. If the atrium fails to generate a heartbeat, then a healthy AV node can do so at a rate of about 40, and if needed, the ventricles themselves can generate heartbeats at a rate of about 20 per minute. This may occur if the cells of the upper chamber fail to generate an electrical impulse or if the electrical signals to the ventricle are blocked. However, these lower rates may be associated with the inability of the heart to pump blood to the body to meet its needs and may result in ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', ''weakness'', or passing out.' "
What causes heart rhythm disorders?,"""Heart rhythm disturbances may occur because of problems within the heart itself or be the result of abnormalities in the body's environment that can affect the heart's ability to conduct electricity.""'Cardiac or heart muscle cells become irritated when they are depleted of oxygen. This can occur during a ''heart attack'', in which the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, are blocked. Lack of oxygen can occur when the lungs are unable to extract oxygen from the air. Significant ''anemia'', or ''low red blood cell count'', decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and may prevent adequate oxygen delivery. Rapid heart rates may be due to ""wiring"" problems with the electrical pathways in the heart. This can cause ""short circuits"" making the heart speed up and beat 150 beats a minute or more. The abnormality can be due to a physical extra electrical pathway such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or it can be due to changes in the electrical physiology between a few cells, like in ''atrial flutter''.''Rapid heart rates can also occur because of environmental issues that affect the heart. These can be intrinsic to the body, like ''anemia'', abnormal electrolyte levels, or abnormal ''thyroid hormone'' levels. They may also be due to reactions to outside influences like ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' remedies, or ''stimulants'' such as ''amphetamines''. To the ''cardiac muscle'' cell, they all appear to be adrenaline-like substances that can cause cell irritation.''Slow dysrhythmias can also be problematic. If the heart beats too slowly, the body may not be able to maintain an adequate ''blood pressure'"" and supply the body's organs with enough oxygen-rich blood to function.""'Slow heart rates may be due to ''aging'' of the SA node and its inability to generate an electrical pacemaker signal. Often though, it is due to the side effects of medications used to control ''high blood pressure''. Side effects of beta blocker and certain ''calcium channel blocker'' ''drugs'' include a slowing of the heart rate.''Body environment is also important with slow heart rhythm abnormalities. ''Hypothermia'', or low body temperature, is a potential cause. ' "
What are the different types of heart rhythm disorders?,'Heart rhythm disorders are classified according to where they occur in the heart and how they affect the heartbeat.'  
What are the signs and symptoms of heart rhythm disorders?,"'Many people may have heart rhythm disturbances and never be aware of them. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and ''premature ventricular contractions'' (''PVCs'') are variations of normal and most often, people are unaware that an extra beat has occurred. However, some patients are keenly aware of any extra heartbeat, even if it is a normal variant and requires no treatment.''That said, the initial symptom of dysrhythmia is often ''palpitations'', a sensation that the heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, beating irregularly, or skipping a beat. The ''palpitations'' may be intermittent or may require medical intervention to resolve.'""Because of the heart rhythm abnormality, other symptoms may occur because of decreased cardiac output (the amount of blood that the heart pushes out to meet the body's demand for oxygen and energy). The patient may complain of ""'lightheadedness'', weakness, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''chest pain'', and shortness of breath.'""In critical situations, the patient may fall to the ground or lose consciousness. This may be due to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It may be due to heart rates so fast that there isn't enough blood pressure generated to supply the brain with what it needs. The same result can also occur if the heart beats too slowly and insufficient blood pressure is generated.""  "
Atrial fibrillation (A-fib),"'Atrial fibrillation'' occurs when the atrium has lost the ability to beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of the SA node generating a single electrical signal, numerous areas of the atrium become irritated and produce electrical impulses. This causes the atrium to jiggle, or fibrillate, instead of beating. The AV node sees all the electrical signals, but because there are so many, and because they are so erratic, only some of the hundreds of signals per minute are passed through to the ventricle. The ventricles then fire irregularly and often very quickly.''As in ''PSVT'', the symptoms may include palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The cause of ''atrial fibrillation'', however, may be more significant, since it may be due to ''aging'' of the conducting system of the heart and there may be associated ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease''. Therefore, ''atrial fibrillation'' with rapid ventricular response associated with chest ''pain'' or shortness of breath may need emergent ''cardioversion'' (a procedure that uses electricity to ''shock'' the heart back into a normal rhythm) or intravenous medications to control the heart rate.''One significant complication of atrial fibrillation is the formation of ''blood clots'' along the inside of the heart wall. These clots may break off and travel to different organs in the body (embolize), blocking blood vessels and causing the affected organs to malfunction because of the loss of blood supply. A common complication is a clot traveling to the brain, resulting in a ''stroke''.''The treatment of atrial fibrillation depends upon many factors including how long it has been present, what symptoms it causes, and the underlying health of the individual. The patient and his or her doctor will decide whether or not to restore a normal sinus rhythm or to simply keep the heart rate under control.'""Atrial fibrillation can be a safe rhythm and not life threatening when the rate is controlled. Medications are used to slow the electrical impulses through the AV node, so that the ventricles do not try to capture each signal being produced. The reason to return people to a regular rhythm has to do with cardiac output. In atrial fibrillation, the atria do not beat and pump blood to the ventricles. Instead, blood flows into the ventricles by gravity alone. This lack of atrial kick can decrease the heart's efficiency and cardiac output by 10% to 15%.""'Blood thinning, or anticoagulation, may be recommended for those patients with atrial fibrillation and elevated risk for ''stroke''. Oral drugs that anticoagulate are ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), dabigatran (Pradaxa), ''rivaroxaban'' (''Xarelto''), and ''apixaban'' (''Eliquis''). There are other injectable drugs that are used in a hospital setting. If the patient is at low risk, the doctor may recommend ''aspirin'' alone for ''stroke prevention'"". If atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated due to symptomatic palpitations or symptoms of reduced cardiac output, or if there are concerns with lifelong anticoagulation therapy, more definitive therapy may include specific medications, electrical cardioversion, or catheter based ablation (sometimes with a pacemaker inserted). Atrial fibrillation is a common condition, with many implications, and the best plan for each patient should be discussed at length with one's physician. "" "
Atrial flutter,"'Atrial ''flutter'' is similar to atrial fibrillation except that instead of having chaotic electrical firing from all points in the atrium, one point has become irritated and can fire 300 times per minute or more. Many issues that exist for atrial fibrillation apply to atrial flutter. Atrial flutter may degenerate into atrial fibrillation, and the two can often coexist.' "
Sinus bradycardia,"'The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under the many outside influences causing it to beat more slowly. Sinus bradycardia (brady = slow + cardia = heart) by definition, is a heartbeat generated by the SA node at a rate slower than 60 beats per minute. This may be normal in people who are active and athletic or in patients taking medications designed to slow the heart such as ''beta blockers'' and some ''calcium channel blockers''.''Vasovagal'' ''syncope'' is an episode of profound sinus bradycardia associated with a noxious stimulus that causes the vagal system of the body to kick in and slow the heart rate. While the sympathetic system of the body is mediated by adrenaline, the parasympathetic system is mediated by the vagus nerve and the chemical acetylcholine, which promotes the exact opposite body reaction than adrenaline. In some people, exposure to ''pain'' or a difficult emotional situation can stimulate the vagus nerve, slow the heart, and dilate blood vessels (veins), causing cardiac output to decrease and making a person feel lightheaded or faint. The vagus nerve also can be stimulated to slow the heart when one bears down to urinate (micturition syncope) or have a bowel movement.' "
Tachycardia,"'Rapid heart rates can originate from either the atrium or the ventricle, but rhythms from the ventricle are more often life threatening. The initial approach to rapid heart rates is to quickly identify the rhythm, and if blood pressure is maintained and there is no evidence of a failing heart, then treatment is directed to rate control with the eventual return of the heart back to normal sinus rhythm. If, however, there is evidence that the heart is failing because of the rapid rate, then emergency measures, including using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm, may be necessary.' "
Sinus tachycardia,"'The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under many outside influences that may cause it to beat more quickly. Sinus tachycardia (sinus = from the SA node + tachy = rapid + cardia = heart), or a rapid regular heartbeat, is a common rhythm issue. It occurs when the body signals the heart to pump more blood, or when the electrical system is stimulated by chemicals.''The body needs increased cardiac output in times of physiologic ''stress''. Cardiac output is the amount of blood the heart pumps in the course of 1 minute. It can be calculated by the amount of blood that the heart pumps with each beat (''stroke volume'') multiplied by the heart rate.''Cardiac output = (''stroke'' volume) x (heart rate)''The ''stroke'' volume tends to be relatively constant. When the body requires extra oxygen delivery, the heart rate needs to increase to meet that demand. Examples include:''The electrical system can be stimulated in a variety of ways to make the heart beat faster. In times of ''stress'', the body generates cortisol and adrenaline, causing an increased heart rate in addition to other changes in the body. Think of being frightened and feeling your heart race. Increased thyroid hormone levels in the body can also cause a tachycardia. Ingestion of a variety of drugs can also cause the heart to race, including ''caffeine'', alcohol, and over-the-counter cold medications that include chemicals such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds are metabolized by the body and act like an adrenaline stimulus to the heart. Illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and ''cocaine'' can also cause a sinus tachycardia. ' exercise, in which the muscles have greater oxygen requirements and the heart rate speeds up to pump more blood to meet that need; dehydration, in which there is less fluid in the body and the heart rate has to speed up to compensate; or in cases of acute bleeding that may occur after trauma."
Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib),"""Ventricular fibrillation is technically not a rapid heart rhythm because the heart ceases to beat. In ventricular fibrillation, the ventricles do not have a coordinated electrical pattern and the ventricles, instead of beating, just jiggle, or fibrillate. Since the heart doesn't beat, blood is not circulated to the body or brain and all bodily functions stop. Without a coordinated impulse to signal the ventricle to beat, ""'sudden cardiac death'' occurs.''The treatment for V-fib is ''defibrillation'' with an electrical shock. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places have helped decrease the mortality from sudden cardiac death, but ''prevention'' remains the mainstay to survive this event. Some people, such as those with a very weak heart muscle or who have a prior history of ventricular fibrillation will require an implantable ''defibrillator'' to prevent future episodes of sudden death and treat this rhythm.'""This rhythm is often associated with a heart attack in which the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood supply (myocardial ischemia), becomes irritated, and causes secondary irritation of the electrical system. Aside from myocardial ischemia, other causes of ventricular fibrillation may include severe weakness of the heart muscle (""'cardiomyopathy''), electrolyte disturbances, drug overdose, and poisoning.' "
Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach),"'Ventricular tachycardia is another rapid heart rate that originates in the ventricle. The causes are the same as those for ventricular fibrillation, but because of the electrical conduction pattern in the heart pathways, an organized signal is provided to the ventricles, potentially allowing them to beat. This remains an emergency, since V-tach may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.' "
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs),"'Every person experiences the occasional palpitation in which the atrium or the ventricle beats early. These premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are normal variants and most people are unaware of their occurrence. However, some patients report a palpitation in the chest and neck, often described as a ""thump"" or ""thud."" PACs and PVCs in otherwise healthy individuals do not pose any health risks.' "
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT),"'Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia'' (PSVT) occurs when the pathways in the AV node or atrium allow an altered conduction of electricity, and the atrium begins firing in a fast but regular rate, sometimes more than 150 to 200 times per minute. The ventricles, sensing the electrical activity coming through the AV node, try to beat along with each electrical impulse and PSVT occurs.''This is rarely a life-threatening event, but people may feel uncomfortable when PSVT occurs. They may become lightheaded, weak, have shortness of breath, and describe a feeling of fullness in the throat. PSVT may also be tolerated and may stop on its own. ''If this is a first time event, activating EMS (emergency medical services) and calling 9-1-1 is important, since other tachycardias can be life threatening.'""The treatment for PSVT includes attempts to stimulate the vagus nerve to slow the heart (see vasovagal syncope above) by holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement. Intravenous medications are often used to interrupt the episode. Many patients have PSVT due to congenital abnormalities in the electrical conduction system of the heart. External causes can include ""'hyperthyroidism'', electrolyte imbalances, and the use of caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold medications containing stimulants, or illegal drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine.' "
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'' is a specific type of PSVT, in which an inborn error of wiring has occurred near the AV node, and an accessory electrical pathway exists. The diagnosis is made by ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') or electrophysiologic testing, and the treatment may include medication or destruction of the accessory electrical pathway by invasive catheter ablation.' "
Bradycardia,"'Aside from medications that are meant to slow the heart for treatment of a variety of medical problems, bradycardia (brady = low + cardia = heart) is usually due to ''heart block'"" and the aging of the electrical wiring of the heart. This is no different than the aging of your home's electrical system; but instead of being able to rewire the heart, these conditions may need to be treated with an ""'implantable pacemaker''.' "
Heart blocks,"'Heart blocks involving the ventricle may be asymptomatic and of little consequence except to point to underlying heart or lung disease. They are diagnosed by EKG.''Heart blocks involving the atrium can be classified as first-, second-, and third-degree.''Heart blocks are symptomatic because the heart beats so slowly that cardiac output is decreased. The symptoms may include lightheadedness or passing out (syncope), weakness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.''Diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening heart block happen at the same time. Often, the patient with bradycardia may be taking medications that can slow the heart including beta blockers and certain calcium channel blockers. If the patient is stable, time can be taken to have the medications wear off while the patient is monitored. If the bradycardia remains, a pacemaker may be needed. In certain situations, a temporary pacemaker can be placed to stabilize the patient, while decisions are made as to a permanent solution. ' First-degree heart block is common and usually of little significance. There is a slight delay in getting the electrical signal from the SA node to the AV node, but the heart functions normally. There are two types of second-degree heart block (Mobitz I and Mobitz II, with Type II being more serious than Type I. Third-degree heart block describes the complete loss of connection between the electrical activity of the atria and the ventricles. Second- and third-degree heart blocks are diagnosed by analyzing heart rhythm strips and EKGs."
When to seek medical care,"'Unexplained palpitations are not normal, especially when associated with shortness of breath, ''sweating'', feelings of chest pressure, or passing out. The person should be made comfortable and laid flat, and EMS (emergency medical service) should be activated by calling 9-1-1 or the emergency number in your area.''If the person is unconscious or unresponsive, Basic life support (American Heart Association) should be initiated. Call 9-1-1, get an AED, and decide whether CPR should be initiated.''If the episode is short-lived and resolves spontaneously, the primary care professional should be contacted urgently to seek advice.''If the episode is a recurrent problem, the diagnosis is known, and the rhythm disturbance resolves itself, then a less urgent call to the primary care professional is warranted.''It is reasonable to seek emergent medical care any time that a heart rhythm disturbance occurs or if there is concern that a heart problem is present.' "
How are heart rhythm disorders diagnosed?,"'The mainstay of diagnosis remains the EKG and heart rhythm monitoring. These are often done immediately in the ambulance or upon arrival in the emergency department. In many patients, the palpitations or symptoms may have resolved, and no acute rhythm abnormalities can be found.''Depending on the associated symptoms and the history, observation and monitoring of the heart may occur in hospital or as an outpatient. In patients who have passed out, admission to the hospital often occurs. Those patients with chest pain and shortness of breath may also be admitted to evaluate their heart. In patients who are not admitted, a heart monitoring device may be placed to monitor the rhythm for a duration of time. Monitors may be worn for 24 hours or up to 1 month. In some instances, rhythm identification is elusive and may take months or years to capture and identify. Implantable cardiac monitors may be placed for periods greater than 1 year.''If the rhythm is known, then tests to identify potential causes may be done. These are dependent on the specific rhythm abnormality and can range from blood tests to lung evaluations and ''sleep'' studies to echocardiograms and electrophysiologic testing. '  "
What is the treatment for heart rhythm disorders?,"'There is no one treatment for a heart rhythm abnormality. When the patient is unstable, with no pulse or blood pressure, or when they are unconscious, American Heart Association guidelines are available to direct care to hopefully restore the heart rhythm to normal and return a pulse.''For V-fib and V-tach, electricity may be the most important drug, and the heart is shocked back into a heart rhythm, hopefully compatible with life. Other common medications used in crises situations depend upon the life-threatening rhythm and may include epinephrine (''adrenalin''), ''atropine'', and ''amiodarone''.'""For patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the goal is not only to slow down the heart rate but also to identify which rhythm is present. Vasovagal maneuvers, like holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement may resolve the situation, or it may slow the rate temporarily to make the diagnosis. Adenosine can be injected and may convert SVT to normal sinus rhythm by slowing the electrical impulse at the AV node. It can also be used as a diagnostic challenge to help identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.""'For atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the initial goal is to slow the rate and maintain normal blood pressure. Calcium channel clockers like ''diltiazem'' and beta blockers like ''metoprolol'' may be used intravenously to control rate. ''Digoxin'' is a second-line medication that may be helpful when first-line medications fail. In ''unstable'' patients, with chest pain, shortness of breath, or decreased consciousness, cardioversion with an electric shock may be required. The decision to ''electively'' convert ''A-fib'' to normal sinus rhythm depends upon the patient and situation and is often a decision left to the primary care professional. The question regarding anticoagulation also will need to be addressed. '  "
What is the prognosis for heart rhythm disorders?,"'While most heart dysrhythmias can be treated and controlled, ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia can be fatal. Their recognition and treatment are true emergencies, and there is no guarantee that sudden cardiac death can be reversed.''For all other rhythm abnormalities, there may be time to make the diagnosis and design a treatment plan. The goal is to minimize the effect that the dysrhythmia has on daily activity and quality of life.' "
Can heart rhythm disorders be prevented?,"'Minimizing risk factors for ''heart disease'' will be helpful, including controlling blood pressure, ''lowering cholesterol'', keeping ''diabetes'' under control, and not ''smoking''.''For those with rapid palpitations that are intermittent, avoiding stimulants like alcohol, caffeine, over-the-counter cold medications, and illicit drugs are important preventive measures. ' "
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is a miscarriage?,"'A miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a ''pregnancy'' from ''conception'"" to 20 weeks' gestation. The term ""'stillbirth'"" refers to the death of a fetus after 20 weeks' gestation. Miscarriage is sometimes referred to as spontaneous abortion because the medical term abortion means the ending of a pregnancy, whether intentional or unintentional. Most miscarriages occur in the ""'first trimester'' of pregnancy, from seven to twelve weeks after conception.' "
How common is miscarriage?,"'Miscarriage is very common. As many or even most miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that a woman does not even realize that she is ''pregnant'', it is difficult to estimate how frequently miscarriages occur. Some experts believe that about half of all fertilized eggs die before implantation or are miscarried. Of known ''pregnancies'' (in which a woman misses a period or has a positive ''pregnancy test''), about 10% to 20% end in miscarriage.' "
What causes miscarriage?,"'The majority of miscarriages are believed to be caused by genetic problems within the embryo that would prevent a baby from developing normally and surviving after birth. These fatal genetic errors are not usually related to genetic problems in the mother.''In other cases, certain illnesses or medical conditions can cause miscarriage or may increase the risk of miscarriage. Mothers who have ''diabetes'' or ''thyroid disease'' are at increased risk of miscarriage. Infections that spread to the placenta, including some viral infections, can also increase the risk of miscarriage.''In general, risk factors for miscarriage include the following:''Women who have had one miscarriage have an incidence of miscarriage of about 20%, whereas women who have three or more consecutive miscarriages may have a risk as high as 43%.'   Older maternal age Cigarette smoking (>10 cigarettes/day) Moderate to high alcohol consumption Trauma to the uterus Radiation exposure Previous miscarriage Maternal weight extremes (BMI either below 18.5 or above 25 kg/m2) Anatomical abnormalities of the uterus Illicit drug use Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) around the time of conception"
What are the types of miscarriage?,"'Miscarriages are sometimes referred to by tissue-specific names to reflect the clinical findings or the type of miscarriage. Examples include:' Threatened abortion: a woman may experience vaginal bleeding or others signs of miscarriage (see below), but loss of the pregnancy has not yet occurred Incomplete abortion: some of the products of conception (fetal and placental tissues) have been expelled from the uterus, but some remain. Complete abortion: all of the tissue from the pregnancy has been expelled Missed abortion: the fetus has not developed, so there is no viable pregnancy, but there is placental tissue and/or fetal tissue contained within the uterus Septic abortion: a miscarriage in which there is infection in the uterus which contains retained fetal and/or placental tissue."
What are signs and symptoms of a miscarriage?,"'Vaginal bleeding'' and ''pelvic pain'' are the hallmark ''symptoms of miscarriage''. All vaginal bleeding during pregnancy should be investigated, although not all instances of bleeding result from a miscarriage. Bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy is very common and does not typically signify a miscarriage. The ''pain'' tends to be dull and cramping, and it may come and go or be present constantly. Sometimes, there is passage of fetal or placental tissue. This material may appear whitish and covered with blood. The bleeding may be associated with the passage of\xa0''blood clots''. The amount of bleeding does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the situation, and miscarriage may be associated with bleeding that ranges from mild to severe.'  "
How is miscarriage diagnosed?,"'An ''ultrasound'' examination is typically performed if a woman has symptoms of a miscarriage. The ultrasound can determine if the pregnancy is intact and if a fetal heartbeat is present. Ultrasound examination can also reveal whether the pregnancy is an ''ectopic pregnancy'"" (located outside of the uterus, typically in the Fallopian tube), which may have similar symptoms and signs as miscarriage. Other tests that may be performed including blood tests for pregnancy hormones, blood counts to determine the degree of blood loss or to see whether infection is present, and a pelvic examination. The mother's ""'blood type'' should also be checked at the time of a miscarriage, so that Rh-negative women can receive an injection of rho-D immune globulin (RhoGam) to prevent problems in future pregnancies.' "
What happens after a miscarriage?,"'There are no specific treatments that can stop a miscarriage, although women who are at risk and have not yet miscarried may be advised to rest in bed, abstain from sexual activity, and restrict all physical activity until any warning signs are no longer present. Once a miscarriage occurs, there is no treatment available. In many cases, the miscarriage will take its course, and unless there is severe ''pain'' and cramping or severe blood loss, no treatment is required. If a miscarriage does not progress to spontaneous expulsion of all pregnancy tissue from the uterus, a procedure known as a dilatation and curettage (D&C) can be performed to remove the remaining pregnancy material. This treatment is used in the case of a missed abortion, for example, when the pregnancy material is not expelled from the uterus.''As mentioned above, women who are Rh-negative will receive a dose of rho-D immune globulin to prevent complications in future pregnancies.''If a miscarriage is due to infection, antibiotic treatment will be given.''Miscarriage is such a common occurrence that typically, unless known risk factors are present, no special testing is performed. For couples who have experienced more than two miscarriages, diagnostic studies to detect genetic, hormonal, or anatomical problems may be recommended. Some doctors recommend evaluation of the couple after the second miscarriage, particularly if the woman is over 35 years of age.' "
What is the outlook for future pregnancies after a miscarriage?,"'Most women who miscarry go on to have a subsequent pregnancy. The likelihood of a miscarriage in a future pregnancy increases with the total number of miscarriages a woman has previously experienced. In general, the risk of recurrence in women who have had a previous miscarriage is about 15%. The risk is about 30% in women who have had two miscarriages. Most women will have their ''menstrual period'' within 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage. Your doctor can advise you when you may start ''trying to conceive'' again. While it is possible to conceive again after your menstrual period has returned, some doctors advise waiting a bit longer, such as another ''menstrual cycle'' or more, to provide enough time for physical and emotional recovery.' "
Can miscarriage be prevented?,"'There is no evidence that bed rest can help prevent miscarriage, but women who have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy are often advised to rest and limit sexual activity until there are no more potential signs of miscarriage. It is possible that some risk factors for miscarriage can be minimized by maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding the use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or tobacco. Screening for, and treatment of, any sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs'') can also reduce the risk of a miscarriage. In most instances, the ''prevention'"" of a miscarriage is outside of the woman's control."" "
What is an abscessed tooth?,"'When a tooth persistently throbs and keeps you up at night with ''pain'', it could be something more worrisome than a simple ''toothache''. An abscessed tooth is an infection within a tooth that has spread to the root tip or around the root. This infection originates from the tooth\'s inner chamber, which is called the ""pulp chamber."" Contained within the pulp chamber are blood vessels and nerves, collectively called the ""pulp."" Prior to the formation of an ''abscess'', the tooth has essentially lost its ability to fight off infection, and bacteria are able to invade the pulp chamber and multiply. As the bacteria multiply, the bacterial infection usually spreads from the pulp chamber and exits through the bottom of the root into the bone. The abscess is a collection of pus that is made up of dead white blood cells, tissue debris, and bacteria.''A tooth abscess differs from a gum abscess by the source of the original infection. The tooth abscess (or ""periapical abscess"") originates from the pulp of the tooth and exits out the tooth\'s apex at the bottom of the root. A gum abscess (or ""periodontal abscess"") starts in a gum pocket outside of the tooth next to the root from ''gum disease''. Treatment will depend on where the infection originates.' "
What are risk factors for an abscessed tooth?,"'For the most part, poor oral hygiene and dental care increases the risk of an infected tooth. Grinding or clenching ''teeth'' (''bruxism''), high ''sugar'' ''diet'', other tooth ''trauma'', and even the presence of previous dental work can predispose an individual to tooth abscess.' "
What causes an abscessed tooth?,"'There are many causes for a dental abscess. A very common cause is when a dental ''cavity'' (''tooth decay'') becomes so large and deep that it reaches the pulp chamber. An inflammatory process takes place within the tooth. Inflammation of the pulp (pulpitis) is usually what is felt as a ''toothache''. Pulpitis is further characterized by tests done by a dentist as reversible or irreversible. Reversible pulpitis means that the pulp is irritated but has an opportunity to recover. Irreversible pulpitis means that it will not recover, and the pulp is dying. Once the pulp is dead (or ""necrotic""), an abscess can form as the infection spreads from the tooth to the gum ligament and jawbone below. Often, a tooth that becomes necrotic can still be saved if steps are taken to resolve the infection at an early stage.''Other causes for a tooth to become necrotic and abscess are (1) a blow to a tooth, (2) dental treatment such as a ''crown'' or a filling that gets too close to the pulp chamber, or (3) trauma to a tooth from grinding or clenching. In every form of a tooth abscess, the pulp is adversely affected and is unable to recover from the insult or injury. A blow to the tooth can immediately sever the tooth\'s blood supply. When the blood supply is lost, the nutrient supply is also lost. As a result, the pulp quickly dies. Trauma from grinding or clenching (called ""occlusal trauma"") is a slower, progressive injury to a tooth.''A tooth that has been previously treated with a ''root canal'' procedure can also develop an abscess. This is often due to the lack of adequate seal from bacteria within the tooth or even a ''fracture'' of the tooth roots.''Any tooth can develop an abscess, but third molars (''wisdom teeth'') are particularly prone to having a dental abscess because they are difficult to keep clean and can develop decay that can go unnoticed. ''Wisdom teeth'' are often removed to avoid this type of complication.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of an abscessed tooth?,"'It is also important to note that abscessed teeth may not have any symptoms at all. Because the tooth has lost vitality (or the ability to feel stimuli), there may be no pain associated with it. However, the abscess is still present and could be further spreading the dental infection. On occasion, an abscessed tooth is detected during a routine radiographic (X-ray) exam where the patient has not experienced any telltale symptoms of an abscessed tooth.'

   The tooth turns dark in color compared to surrounding teeth. The byproducts of the necrotic pulp that leach into the porous tooth layer cause this discoloration. In many cases, there may be no tooth pain present. There is pain with eating or with pressing on the tooth. The abscess that has spread out the root tip causes the supporting structures (gum and bone) to be affected. Sometimes the throbbing or pulsating pain is so severe it can't be relieved with pain medications. This is usually related to the infection spreading and causing more pressure on the surrounding structures of gum and bone. There is swelling on the gum tissue that is filled with pus. The raised swelling looks like a pimple near the affected tooth. An open pimple is called a ""draining fistula"" and has ruptured to release pus. This is an obvious sign of infection. Other signs of a tooth abscess are a bad taste or bad odor in the mouth. Swelling of the face, jaw, or surrounding lymph nodes often signals a growing infection. Jaw pain from the swelling can be present, as well."
How do health care professionals diagnose a dental abscess?,"'A primary care provider or pediatrician can assess the signs and symptoms to determine if a dental abscess is present during a check-up. They can then refer the patient to a dental provider for diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis of a tooth abscess is collectively determined by (1) signs and symptoms reported by the patient, (2) exam and tests that are performed by the dentist, and (3) what is visualized with dental radiographs (''X-rays'').' "
What is the treatment for an abscessed tooth?,"'In adult teeth, the usual treatment for an abscessed tooth begins with properly clearing the infection. Treatment depends on how much the tooth infection has spread. The course of action usually involves oral antibiotics such as ''penicillin''. The tooth is opened to remove the infected contents within the pulp chamber. If needed, incision and drainage is performed on the soft tissue to provide further exit of pus and pressure of a growing infection.''In some situations, the infection can spread quickly and require immediate attention. If a dentist is unavailable and there is a ''fever'', swelling in the face, or swelling in the jaw, a visit to the emergency room is recommended. An emergency room visit is imperative if there is difficulty with ''breathing'' or swallowing.''Once the infection is cleared and the tooth can be restored, a root canal procedure is performed. The ""root canal treatment"" cleans out the entire inner space of the tooth (pulp chamber and the associated canals) and seals the space with an inert rubber material called gutta percha. Cleaning and sealing the inner space protects the tooth from further invasive infections. The tooth may need to be extracted if too much tooth structure or bone that surrounds the tooth is lost from tooth decay and infection.'""For children's primary teeth (""'baby teeth''), if a tooth has abscessed, there is very little that can be done to save the tooth. The infection has advanced and there is no way to completely remove all of the infection. The appropriate treatment to eliminate the infection would be extraction of the abscessed tooth. Complete removal of the abscessed tooth is also important in avoiding a persistent infection that could risk harming the adult tooth that is developing underneath. Oral antibiotics may or may not be needed depending on the extent of the infection.''During ''pregnancy'', a dental abscess requires immediate attention in order to minimize further spread of the infection. Any risk of infection while ''pregnant'' is a concern as the infection can be more severe in pregnant women or could harm the fetus.'  "
Are home remedies effective for an abscessed tooth?,"'Generally, ''oral health'' home remedies are not advised for an abscessed tooth. Home remedies can be used to temporarily alleviate symptoms such as warm saltwater or baking soda rinses, a warm moistened teabag compress over the area and taking ''over-the-counter'' analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''). However, the infection will still progress if not properly treated. Furthermore, avoiding treatment can lead to more serious complications. Seeking care and advice from a dental professional is strongly recommended as soon as possible.'  "
What specialists treat an abscessed tooth?,"'The treatment needed usually determines who will treat the abscessed tooth. For the most part, an abscessed tooth can be managed by a general dentist whether it is to clear an infection, perform the root canal procedure or extract the tooth if needed. Alternatively, a dental specialist called an endodontist can be consulted to treat the abscess and perform the root canal procedure. Another dental specialist, an ''oral surgeon'', can also treat an abscess and extract the tooth if tooth loss is inevitable. For children, a pediatric dentist can provide appropriate care for baby teeth to treat an abscessed tooth. Oral surgeons as well as emergency room and ENT physicians would treat more severe cases where the infection from an abscessed tooth has spread beyond the mouth area.' "
What is the prognosis for an abscessed tooth?,"'The prognosis depends on the extent of the spread of infection. Usually, when the infection is localized to the tooth, the prognosis is very good if treatment is sought as soon as signs and symptoms are noticed. If the infection affects much of the surrounding jawbone of the tooth and has caused the tooth to become loose, the chances of saving the tooth decrease.'  "
What is a dry socket?,"'The typical scenario for ''dry socket'' is the occurrence of throbbing pain about two to four days after the tooth is extracted. Dry socket pain is often accompanied by ''bad breath'' and a foul taste in the mouth. With this onset of pain, it is obvious that proper healing has been interrupted.''Dry socket is a condition of inflammation of the jawbone (or alveolar bone) after a tooth extraction. It is also referred to as ""''alveolar osteitis''"" and is one of the many complications that can occur from a tooth extraction. The hallmark of dry socket is noticeable pain that occurs a few days after a tooth is extracted. Pain from dry socket is often described as a dull, throbbing pain that can range from moderate to unbearable.' "
Is it possible to prevent an abscessed tooth?,"'Good oral health habits and regular dental visits can play a big role in preventing abscessed teeth. Time is also a big factor in whether a tooth is allowed to reach the point of infection. The longer the tooth sits untreated, the higher chance that infection can occur and spread to become an abscess. Once a decayed, fractured, or sensitive tooth is noticed, taking the preventive steps to fix it early will help prevent bigger problems such as an abscessed tooth.' "
What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs?,"'A boil is a localized infection in the skin that begins as a reddened, tender area. Over time, the area becomes firm, hard, and increasingly tender. Eventually, the center of the boil softens and becomes filled with infection-fighting white blood cells from the bloodstream to eradicate the infection. This collection of white blood cells, bacteria, and proteins is known as pus. Finally, the pus ""forms a head,"" which can be surgically opened or may spontaneously drain out through the surface of the skin. Pus enclosed within tissue is referred to as an abscess. A boil is also referred to as a skin abscess. Boils can occur anywhere on the body, including the trunk, extremities, buttocks, groin, armpit, or other areas.'  "
What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs? (Part 2),"'There are several different types of boils:' Furuncle or carbuncle: This is an abscess in the skin usually caused by and infection with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. A furuncle can have one or more openings onto the skin and may be associated with a fever or chills. The term furuncle is used to refer to a typical boil that occurs within a hair follicle. The term carbuncle is typically used to represent a larger abscess that involves a group of hair follicles and involves a larger area than a furuncle. A carbuncle can form a hardened lump that can be felt in the skin. The condition of having chronic, recurrent boils (furuncles or carbuncles) is referred to as furunculosis or carbunculosis, respectively."
What is a boil? What are boil symptoms and signs? (Part 3)," Cystic acne: This is a type of abscess that is formed when oil ducts become clogged and infected. Cystic acne affects deeper skin tissue than the more superficial inflammation from common acne. Cystic acne is most common on the face and typically occurs in the teenage years. Hidradenitis suppurativa: This is a condition in which there are multiple abscesses that form under the armpits and often in the groin area. These areas are a result of local inflammation of the sweat glands. This form of skin infection is difficult to treat with antibiotics alone and typically requires a surgical procedure to remove the involved sweat glands in order to stop the skin inflammation. Pilonidal cyst: This is a unique kind of abscess that occurs in the crease of the buttocks. Pilonidal cysts often begin as tiny areas of infection in the base of the area of skin from which hair grows (the hair follicle). With irritation from direct pressure, over time the inflamed area enlarges to become a firm, painful, and tender nodule that makes it difficult to sit without discomfort. These abscesses frequently form after long trips that involve prolonged sitting."
What causes boils to form?,"'There are many causes of boils. Some boils can be caused by an ''ingrown hair''. Others can form as the result of a splinter or other foreign material that has become lodged in the skin. Others boil, such as those of ''acne'', are caused by plugged sweat glands that become infected. Often the exact cause of a boil cannot be determined.''The skin is an essential part of our immune defense against materials and microbes that are foreign to our body. Any break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape, can develop into an abscess should it become infected with bacteria.' "
Boil vs. pimple,"'A ''pimple'' is a type of skin condition that can appear similar to a boil. ''Pimples'' are most commonly seen in people with ''acne'' of the face, back, or chest. ''Pimples'' may at times be filled with pus (like a boil) in addition to dead skin cells and oily secretions. Like boils, pimples start in pores that are openings for hair follicles in the skin. A boil is typically reddened and causes more ''pain'' than a pimple. Some pimples and boils may be indistinguishable, and these two conditions arise from a similar inflammatory process occurring in the hair follicles, with boils being more severe and representing true infections.' "
Are boils contagious?,"'The bacteria present inside the boil can be contagious to others, especially if there is direct skin-to-skin contact with the secretions from an open boil. (See the section on ''prevention'' for tips on how to prevent the spread of infection from a boil.)' "
What are risk factors for boils?,"""Anyone can develop a boil. However, people with certain illnesses or who take certain medications that weaken the body's immune system (the natural defense system against foreign materials or microbes) are more likely to develop boils. Diseases that are associated with impaired immune systems include ""'diabetes'' and ''kidney failure''. Diseases in which there is inadequate antibody production (such as hypogammaglobulinemia) can also increase the risk of developing boils.''Many medications can suppress the normal immune system and increase the risk of developing boils and other infections. These medications include cortisone medications (''prednisone'' [''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''] and ''prednisolone'' [''Pediapred'' Oral Liquid, ''Medrol'']) and medications used for ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose boils?,"'The diagnosis of a boil can be made by observation of the typical signs and symptoms. Blood tests or specialized laboratory tests are not required to make the diagnosis of a boil. If the infection within a boil has spread to deeper tissues or is extensive, cultures of the pus may be taken from the ''wound'' area to identify the precise type of bacteria responsible for the infection. This can guide the choice of antibiotics for treatment.' "
What are boil treatments and home remedies?,"'Home treatment is an option for most simple boils. Ideally, treatment should begin as soon as a boil is noticed since early treatment may prevent later complications.''The primary home remedy for most boils is heat application, usually with hot or warm water soaks or warm compresses. It may be necessary to apply them 20 minutes at a time for three to four times daily. Heat application increases the circulation to the area and allows the body to better fight off the infection by bringing antibodies and white blood cells to the site of infection.''If a boil occurs as a result of shaving, it is recommended to avoid shaving in that area until the boil has healed to avoid spread of bacteria.''As long as the boil is small and firm, opening the area and draining the boil is not helpful, even if the area is painful. However, once the boil becomes soft or ""forms a head"" (that is, a small ''pustule'' or area of pus is noted in the boil), it can be ready to drain (lance). Once drained, ''pain'' relief can be dramatic. Most small boils, such as those that form around hairs, drain on their own with hot soaks. On occasion, and especially with larger boils, medical treatment is required. In this situation, the boil will need to be drained or ""lanced"" by a health care professional. Frequently, these larger boils contain several pockets of pus that must be opened and drained.''Over-the-counter'' antibiotics are often used to eliminate any accompanying bacterial infection, especially if there is an infection of the surrounding skin. However, antibiotics are not needed in every situation. In fact, antibiotics have difficulty penetrating the outer wall of an abscess well and often will not cure an abscess without additional surgical drainage.''When an antibiotic is used, the choice depends upon the type of infection that is present as well as the results of tests to identify the precise bacteria that infect the area. Examples of ''drugs'' that have been used in the treatment of boils include topical preparations of ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin'' and others), ''mupirocin'' (Bactroban), and ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex'').'  "
When should someone seek medical attention for a boil?,"'While boils typically resolve on their own and have an excellent prognosis, there are special situations in which medical care should be sought when boils develop. Rarely, boils may spread or persist, leading to more widespread infections.''Any boil or abscess in a patient with ''diabetes'' or a patient with an underlying disease that can be associated with a weakened immune system (such as ''cancer'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'"", etc.) should be evaluated by a health care professional. Additionally, many medicines, especially prednisone, that suppress the immune system (the natural infection-fighting system of the body) can complicate what would be an otherwise simple boil. Those who are taking such medications should consult their health care professional if they develop boils. (If someone is not sure about his or her medications' effects on the immune system, a pharmacist may be able to explain which medicines to be concerned about.)""'Any boil that is associated with a fever should receive medical attention. Increasing reddening of the nearby skin and/or formation of ''red streaks on the skin'' (signs that the infection may be spreading), the failure of a boil to ""form a head,"" and the development of multiple boils are other symptoms that warrant a visit to a health care professional. Medical attention is also required for boils in an infant. Boils located on the face, spine, groin, or in the rectum may also require medical attention.''A ""''pilonidal cyst'',"" a boil that occurs between the buttocks, is a special case. These almost always require medical treatment, including drainage and packing (putting gauze in the opened abscess to assure it continues to drain). Finally, any painful boil that is not rapidly improving should be seen by a health care professional.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for a boil?,'The majority of boils in healthy people resolve on their own with home care (described above) without forming a ''scar''. The prognosis is also excellent for boils that are treated in the health care setting by opening or lancing. Antibiotics may or may not be required after a boil has been lanced by a health care professional. Complications of a boil are rare and are more likely to occur in people with suppressed immune systems.' 
What kinds of health care specialists treat boils?,"'Many boils resolve without specific treatment, but a dermatologist is a doctor commonly consulted for management of a boil. Other health care specialists who may treat boils include a primary care doctor, which may be a family practitioner, pediatrician, or internal-medicine doctors. With severe boils or spreading infection, an infectious-disease specialist or surgeon may be consulted. Emergency-medicine doctors may treat certain cases of severe infection caused by boils or abscesses.' "
What are complications of boils?,"'Complications of boils include formation of a larger abscess, a worsening or spreading of infection to adjacent areas of skin or soft tissue (''cellulitis''), and very rarely, spread of the infection through the bloodstream to sites elsewhere in the body. Sometimes a boil may be caused by an organism typically associated with more serious infections, such as methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus'' aureus'' (''MRSA''), with a risk of spreading this infection to deeper tissues. Recurrence of the infection is another possible complication, which is more likely in certain types of boils. Recurrence is most common in the disease ''hidradenitis suppurativa'' and may also occur in situations in which the cause of the boil or abscess is persistent, such as the clogging of oil ducts seen in cystic acne.'  "
What can people do to prevent boils (abscesses)?,"'There are some measures that people can take to prevent boils from forming, although boils are not completely preventable. Good hygiene and the regular use of antibacterial soaps can help to prevent bacteria from building up on the skin. This can reduce the chance for the hair follicles to become infected and prevent the formation of boils. In some situations, a health care professional may recommend special cleansers such as pHisoderm to even further reduce the bacteria on the skin. When the hair follicles on the back of the arms or around the thighs are continually inflamed, regular use of an abrasive brush (loofah brush) in the shower can be used to help break up oil plugs and buildup around hair follicles.''Pilonidal cysts can be prevented by avoiding continuous direct pressure or irritation of the buttock area when a local hair follicle becomes inflamed. At that point, regular soap and hot water cleaning and drying can be helpful.''For acne and hidradenitis suppurativa (see above), topical or oral antibiotics may be required on a long-term basis to prevent recurrent abscess formation. As mentioned above, surgical resection of sweat glands in the involved skin may be necessary. Other medications, such as ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane), can be used for cystic acne and have been helpful in some patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. Recurrences are common in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.''Finally, surgery may occasionally be needed, especially for pilonidal cysts that recur but also for hidradenitis suppurativa. For pilonidal cysts, surgically removing the outer shell of the ''cyst'' is important to clear the boil. The procedure is typically performed in the operating room. For hidradenitis suppurativa, extensive involvement can require surgical repair by a ''plastic'' surgeon.' "
"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "

What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
What is child abuse?,"'Child abuse is any injury intentionally inflicted on a child by a caregiver or during discipline. While the caregiver is usually an adult, most often the mother of the child, it can also include teenagers who are in the ''caregiving'' role, like a babysitter or a camp counselor. It is important to understand that child abuse must involve injury, whether physical or emotional, visible or not immediately visible. So while most child care professionals (for example, psychiatrists, psychologists, pediatricians, and teachers) do not recommend the use of corporal punishment due to the risk of emotional damage and accidental physical injury, spanking a child does not automatically constitute child abuse unless the child sustains some kind of injury.''Many children worldwide suffer abuse every year, affecting all educational and socioeconomic levels, ethnicities, cultures, and religions. The most common form of child abuse in the United States is being left at home alone without adult supervision, also called supervision neglect. All forms of neglect account for about 75% of the child-abuse reports made to child welfare authorities. Other common forms of child abuse include physical assault, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and sexual assault that involves physical contact.''Child abuse has far-reaching negative effects on its victims and on society. Survivors of child maltreatment are at greater risk for physical, emotional, work, and relationship problems throughout childhood and into adulthood.'  "
What are the different types of child abuse?,"'The most common types of child maltreatment are neglect, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse:''Neglect, physical, and sexual abuse are the types of child abuse that usually result in reporting to and intervention by the authorities.' Neglect is the failure of the child's caretaker to provide adequate care for the child. Examples of this form of child maltreatment include a lack of supplying adequate food, shelter, season-appropriate clothing, supervision, medical or mental health care, or a lack of providing appropriate emotional comfort. Supervision neglect is the most common form of child neglect. Physical abuse involves a caretaker inflicting physical injury on a child through assault. That includes corporal punishment that results in physical injuries, like bruises, scratches, welts, or broken bones. Emotional abuse involves statements by a caretaker that can injure a child's sense of self-esteem. Examples of emotional abuse include calling the child negative names, cursing at, or otherwise insulting the child. Sexual abuse involves exposing the child to inappropriate sexual content, behavior, or contact. That can include allowing the child to see pornography or sexual acts or a caretaker having sexual contact with the child."
What are risk factors for child abuse?,"'The risk factors for child abuse include issues that pertain to the victim, perpetrator, family, and community situations. Children under 4 years of age and those with special physical, developmental, or mental health needs are at higher risk for being victims of maltreatment. Younger caregivers who have had child abuse, mental health, or drug problems in their family of origin are more at risk for abusing children. Also, adults who have trouble understanding the needs of children and appropriate ''parenting'"" skills, as well as those who are single parents, of low socioeconomic status, or have transient other adult caregivers (like the parent's friend, boyfriend, or girlfriend) in the home are also more at risk of becoming child abusers.""'Family risk factors for child maltreatment include social isolation, fragmentation, or parents under ''stress'', engaging in ''domestic violence'', or the presence of poor parent-child relationships. Community issues that increase the likelihood that child abuse occurs include low community socioeconomic status, high unemployment rates, high incidence of community violence, high availability of ''alcohol'' or other ''drugs'' (for example, alcohol through liquor stores or bars), and poor community social connections.' "
What are symptoms and signs of child abuse?,"'Children who are victims of abuse often experience symptoms of stress in reaction to the abuse, in addition to symptoms that are specific to the kind of abuse they have suffered. The signs and symptoms of abuse often vary according to the age and developmental stage of the child. It is also important to understand that victims of child abuse suffer abuse in more than one way, so the child may demonstrate symptoms consistent with more than one kind of maltreatment. Examples of less specific signs and symptoms of child abuse include''Examples of risk-taking behaviors in children include unsafe play, like climbing excessively high or ''running'' in the street. More potentially specific signs and symptoms of abuse may include the following:' a tendency to either avoid, overly please, or ingratiate themselves to the abuser; poor school performance; irritability/quickness to anger; crying more often and/or easily; anxiety or panic; frequent complaints of physical symptoms, like headaches and stomachaches; young kids may act younger than their age or than they had previously (regress); spending more time alone, away from friends and family; becoming more ""clingy"" and more dependent on certain relationships; expressing thoughts about hurting him or herself or others; more risk-taking behaviors and/or showing less concern for their own safety. Neglect: The child may lose weight or fail to gain weight appropriately for their age. Their energy level and ability to learn will likely decrease. They may become withdrawn and show physical signs of malnutrition, like dry skin or hair or develop thinning hair. Physical abuse: A child who is the victim of physical abuse may have repeated physical injuries and emergency room or other doctor's visits with or without adequate explanation. They may claim to be accident prone or provide other stories about how they sustained injuries and may tend to wear excessive clothing to cover injuries or otherwise engage in secrecy in an attempt to protect the abuser from intervention by child welfare authorities and law enforcement. Emotional abuse: Emotionally abused children may make negative statements about themselves or others that mimic the abuser, like calling his or herself names or otherwise exhibiting pessimism or low self-esteem. Sexual abuse: A sexually abused child may exhibit sexual knowledge or behaviors that are much older than is appropriate for their age. They may also exhibit inappropriately sexual behavior, resulting in their engaging in masturbating excessively or in front of others, as well as participating in inappropriate sexual play with children. They may also respond opposite to that by avoiding bathing, toileting, examination by a professional, or otherwise having to take off their clothes. Medically, sexually abused children may develop genital injuries or sexually transmitted diseases."
How do physicians diagnose child abuse?,"'Many health care professionals may help make the diagnosis of child abuse, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians, other primary care providers, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely perform or refer for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of establishing the diagnosis. Child abuse may be associated with a number of other medical conditions, so health care providers often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed, particularly if physical abuse is suspected. As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the occurrence of child abuse. Medical professionals will conduct a thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental health symptoms such that child maltreatment can be distinguished from other sources of emotional problems.' "
What is the treatment for child abuse?,"""The treatment for child abuse involves first securing the safety of the child from further abuse and addressing any physical injuries from which the child may be suffering. As these interventions are occurring, child-welfare services work with law enforcement in assessing the safety of the child in the home, whether or not the child should be removed from that home and the potential need for further legal involvement because of the abuse allegations. When it is determined that sexual abuse has occurred, the perpetrator of the abuse is usually required to have their name included on a sexual offenders' registry, which will prevent them from working in settings that involve children and may impose legal penalties if the offender has any contact with people under 18 years of age.""'Medical interventions may involve addressing a variety of issues, like treating broken bones, ''concussion'', or other ''head injury'' associated with physical abuse, genital injuries, or ''sexually transmitted disease'' that may result from sexual abuse.''Addressing the emotional impact of child abuse on the victim is an important part of treatment of child maltreatment. A mental health professional usually assesses the mental health of the child, either through screening questions or tests by the pediatrician or through a full mental health assessment. If it is determined that the child is suffering from a mental health condition, it will be treated through individual or group therapy, as well as medication treatment when appropriate.'""Family oriented interventions for child abuse may involve providing the caretaker with classes on anger management to help them develop healthy ways to manage their anger, parenting classes as a means of improving their knowledge and implementation of parenting approaches that are appropriate for the child's age, developmental level, medical, mental, and emotional needs. Family interventions may also involve the use of a parent mentor to provide the caretaker with a role model from whom they can learn appropriate parenting skills. Family therapy involves family members meeting with a therapist, which helps to process and resolve family issues. If the parent is found to be suffering from a specific mental health condition, that should be treated accordingly."" "
What are the complications and prognosis of child abuse?,"'Children subjected to maltreatment are at risk for a variety of physical and emotional problems, often depending on their age. Physically, children can suffer from ''brain injury'', including mental retardation, ''concussions'', ''seizures'', and death. Behaviorally and emotionally, children may develop a myriad of problems, including ''depression'', ''anxiety'', trouble bonding with others, and issues with controlling their anger.''Adults who were the victims of child abuse are at higher risk for a variety of emotional and physical problems, as well as for economic problems. The most common physical problems are neurological and musculoskeletal problems, followed by respiratory, ''heart'', and gastrointestinal ailments. Compared to adults with no history of child-abuse victimization, those abused as children are at risk for achieving lower levels of education, employment, income, and assets. Those risks are apparently even greater for women compared to men. Adult survivors of abuse are also at higher risk of incarceration and for ''family violence'' occurring in their own homes.' "
Is it possible to prevent child abuse?,"""There are primary, secondary, and tertiary ways of preventing child abuse. Primary intervention involves awareness training for professionals who work with children, policy makers for children's issues, and for the public. Secondary ""'prevention'' programs work to alleviate the risk factors that make vulnerable children at risk for abuse. Tertiary prevention programs work with families in which abuse has already occurred in an attempt to decrease the effects of the abuse and to prevent it from occurring again.''Attempts at secondary and tertiary prevention of child abuse tend to address the risk factors and strengthen protective factors. Such programs often use approaches that strengthen parenting skills and supports, as well as enhance the ability for the caretaker to provide for the needs of the child. The inverse of most risk factors, protective factors for child abuse include having the involvement of supportive family and community, strengthening family and peer relationships, developing healthy coping skills, and improving individual emotional regulation.' "
What should people do if they suspect that a child is being abused?,"'If it is suspected that a child is being abused, laws in most of the United States require that a professional that is in the role of caring for the child (for example, a teacher, doctor, or daycare provider) make a formal report of the abuse to child-welfare authorities in the state in which it is suspected to have occurred. Those professionals are often called mandated reporters. Both for those professionals and for people who are not mandated reporters, child-abuse reporting hotlines are available in every state in the United States.'  "

What are anabolic steroids?,"'Anabolic steroids are one type of performance-enhancing drug or medication. They mimic testosterone in the body to enhance performance by making muscle cells larger and by allowing the body to recover more quickly from the ''stress'' of ''exercise''. Slang for anabolic steroids is ''roids''.'""Performance-enhancing drugs are no longer just for bodybuilders or pro athletes who are willing to try illegal and potentially dangerous means to improve their body's function. These drugs are being used every day by people of all ages, from middle-school, high-school, and college students to older recreational athletes.""'There are two types of steroids that the body naturally produces:''Catabolic steroids'"" or glucocorticoids are part of the body's response to ""'stress''. The word ''catabolic'' comes from the Greek word meaning to ""throw down,"" and these steroids help break down large chemicals into smaller ones. For example, cortisol helps glycogen (a large molecule that is stored in the ''liver'') metabolize into glucose, a small molecule that can be used for energy by the body. The adrenal glands naturally manufacture cortisol, and it is required for many of the basic functions of the body, including glucose metabolism, the immune response to infection, and protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Prescription medications, such as ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''), hydrocortisone (''Westcort''), and ''dexamethasone'' (Decadron [discontinued], DexPak), are examples of steroids that are used to reduce inflammation and treat a range of illnesses from ''asthma'' and ''COPD'' to ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''allergic'' reactions. Low-dose hydrocortisone is the active ingredient in creams that help treat the inflammation from ''insect bites'', ''poison ivy'', ''eczema'', and other local skin irritations.''Anabolic androgenic steroids'' are steroids that mimic testosterone in the body. Anabolic refers to the properties of these drugs to increase production of proteins that act as building blocks for muscle cells, bone, and other tissues within the body. The androgenic response (andro=male + genic=formation) describes the increased male features (secondary sexual characteristics) that occur as a result of androgenic steroids, including facial, body, and pubic hair, deepened voice, and increased sex drive or libido.''There are medical indications for prescribing these medications. Some include the following:''Some physicians believe that the decreased testosterone levels that occurs normally with ''aging'' is an indication for replacement therapy with anabolic steroids, but their use in otherwise healthy older patients is still controversial because of the potential serious side effects.''Chemists have manufactured many different types of anabolic steroids over the past decades. The goal of chemists is to promote the anabolic effect of the drug while decreasing the androgenic side effects that can be life-threatening. Examples of anabolic steroids include the following:' Inadequate testosterone production in the body, either because of inborn errors of metabolism or because of illnesses that decrease production Certain types of anemia Recovery from major illness or injury, including burns, where the body's metabolism needs to be increased to produce more protein An adjunct treatment for certain types of breast cancer Hereditary angioedema HIV wasting syndrome Growth failure and short statures in the pediatric population Testosterone (Axiron, Androgel, Fortesta, Testopel, Striant, Delatestryl, Testim, Androderm) Androstenedione Stanozolol (Winstrol) Nandrolone (Deca-Durabolin) Methandrosteolone (Dianabol)"
Why do people abuse anabolic steroids?,"'People abuse steroids for a variety of reasons, but most do it to increase body performance and appearance. There may be peer pressure to use anabolic steroids in some sports because of a fear that normal training will not be enough to succeed. There is also the perception that other athletes are abusing steroids and gaining an unfair advantage.''People who use steroids to enhance their appearance by increasing muscle and decreasing fat may suffer from muscle dysmorphia or abnormal perception of their own body. Males may think that they are perpetually too small and weak, and females may think themselves fat, even though that perception may not be actually true.''Bodybuilders and weight lifters are not the only athletes to think that anabolic steroid use is their road to success. Athletes, from strength sports like football and throwing the discus to speed sports like track sprinters and speed skaters, have attempted to use steroids to enhance performance and increase the efficiency of their training.' "
How do people abuse anabolic steroids?,"'Though most anabolic steroids need to be injected into the body to be effective, some may be taken by mouth and others used as a cream or gel and applied to the skin. The user will try to take enough anabolic steroid to increase the ability to ''exercise'' and allow muscles to grow while minimizing the risk of side effects and the potential of being caught. Usually people take steroids in cycles with regular injections followed by periods of rest. Numerous books and web sites discuss the benefits and risks of different techniques to maximize the effect of a variety of steroids on the body. There is a large underground illegal industry that has grown to meet the demand for anabolic steroids and provides methods to try to avoid detection.''Cycling'', stacking, and pyramiding are three common ways that anabolic steroid abusers take their drugs. Cycling refers to taking a steroid for a period, stopping for the body to rest, and then restarting again. If people use more than one type of steroid at a time, this is called stacking. There is the belief that using two or more steroids at a time increases the effectiveness of each. Pyramiding combines the cycling and stacking. One or more steroids are begun in a low dose and the dose gradually increased until halfway through the cycle where the amount is maximized and it is then tapered to zero by the end of the cycle.''Tailor exercise programs so that more can be done as the effect of the steroid increases. The cycles of steroid use are usually six to 12 weeks long, followed by a rest period.''In athletes who use anabolic steroids, a cat and mouse game exists. They try to time their steroid injections so that the drug is out of their system during drug testing. Sometimes people take masking drugs to try to ""beat"" the test by making the test negative. Chemists continually develop designer steroids to again prevent their use from being detected.' "
Are anabolic steroids addictive? What are the symptoms and signs of anabolic steroid abuse?,"'Like ''alcohol'' or street drugs, the common signs of ''addiction'' may develop with the use of steroids. These include drug cravings, requiring more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal symptoms if someone stops the drug. The following is a statement from the National Institute of ''Drug Abuse'' concerning anabolic steroids:''""An undetermined percentage of steroid abusers may become addicted to the drugs, as evidenced by their continued abuse despite physical problems and negative effects on social relations. Also, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drugs, which is another indication that they may be addicted. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking steroids, such as''The most dangerous of the withdrawal symptoms is ''depression'', because it sometimes leads to ''suicide'' attempts. If left untreated, some depressive symptoms associated with anabolic steroid withdrawal have been known to persist for a year or more after the abuser stops taking the drugs.""' mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, insomnia, reduced sex drive, and steroid cravings."
What are the psychological and physical side effects of anabolic steroid abuse?,"   Anabolic steroids are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase the ability to do work and exercise by abnormally stimulating muscle growth, power, and aerobic capacity. This increased function comes with a cost of potentially life-threatening side effects. The complications of anabolic steroid abuse are a result of excess testosterone affecting almost all the organ systems in the body. Some of the effects are reversible and decrease when the drug abuse stops while others are permanent and irreversible. In males, the excess steroid suppresses the normal testosterone production in the body. This can lead to shrunken testicles and decreased sperm count, baldness, and breast development (gynecomastia). In females, anabolic steroid abuse can lead to masculinization with loss of body fat and breast size, swelling of the clitoris (which may be permanent and not resolve, even though a woman stops using steroids), deepening of the voice, and the development of facial and body hair. Life-threatening side effects includeheart attack and stroke,the risk of forming blood clots (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus),liver cancer, andliver failure. heart attack and stroke, the risk of forming blood clots (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus), liver cancer, and liver failure. Excess steroid use often affects the skin, and the issues are similar to the adolescent male going through puberty with its testosterone spike. Hair can become oily. Acne is often present. Acne conglobata is a particularly severe form of acne that can develop during steroid abuse or even after a person stops taking the drug. Infections are a common side effect of steroid abuse because of needle sharing and unsanitary techniques used when injecting the drugs into the skin. These are similar risks to IV drug abusers with increased potential to acquire blood-borne infections such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. Skin abscesses may occur at injection sites and may spread to other organs of the body. Endocarditis or an infection of the heart valves is not uncommon. Psychiatric and psychological complications include manic behavior and psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. Aggressive behavior is common and known as ""roid rage."" Because the muscle growth can occur quickly, it can cause stress on the tendons that attach the muscle to bone and those who abuse anabolic steroids are at risk for tendon rupture. Anabolic steroids can increase bone production, especially in the skull and face. Teeth can splay apart as the maxilla and mandible grow. There can be overgrowth of the forehead, giving an ""Incredible Hulk"" appearance. If adolescent teenagers abuse steroids before they have finished growing, these drugs can prematurely close bone growth plates, leading to short stature."
How do health care professionals diagnose anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'The diagnosis of anabolic steroid abuse in high school, college, and professional athletes may occur with a failed drug test, but many people who abuse these drugs are never randomly tested. Doctors often make the diagnosis when someone develops one of the side effects of steroid use.''Once the potential diagnosis of drug abuse is considered, it is important that the health care provider offer the opportunity for the patient to consider drug treatment options, just like any other addictive drug. However, the patient must take the first step in diagnosis and treatment by admitting there is a potential for abuse and their willingness to consider intervention and treatment.' "
What is the treatment for anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'Counseling is the mainstay of therapy for anabolic steroid abuse. The patient and their support group, family and friends, need to appreciate that the approach to this addiction may be similar to addiction to other drugs and alcohol.''Depression'' and ''suicidal thoughts'' may occur when one stops taking steroids, and this potential must be monitored closely.''Withdrawal symptoms vary with each patient, and the health care professional may need to prescribe short courses of medications to help with ''headaches'', muscle aches, and ''insomnia''.' "
Is it possible to prevent anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'Prevention of steroid abuse begins at a young age. There is pressure even at middle school to take drugs to increase performance on the playing field and in the gym. As well, personal appearance and perception begin early on. Unrealistic expectations can drive adolescent boys and girls to try to achieve the often unrealistic image of models in fashion magazines and athletes in the gym.''Counseling and guidance that continues through high school and beyond effectively decreases steroid use in the younger population.''According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the use of anabolic steroids continues to be a significant problem in the adolescent population. Their continuing monitoring studies found that in 2014 the following percentage of students used anabolic steroids in the past year:''Over their lifetime, 1.9% of the 12th graders had abused steroids.'  8th grade, 0.6% 10th grade, 0.7% 12th grade, 0.6%"

What is the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare)?,"""This was adapted from an Apr. 24, 2013, discussion with Kyle Lee, a consultant in health-care reform with MedTrack, Inc., of Springfield, MO. What follows are Mr. Lee's concepts of the future health-care landscape as he relayed them to me. --""' William C. Shiel Jr. MD, FACP, FACR''The entire health-care industry is poised for the most profound changes in several generations. These changes can be categorized into Market Changes and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA is the most visible and most talked about driver of change, there are also numerous, less conspicuous factors that are already altering the way care is delivered and how it is paid for.''The ultimate decision supported by the 2012 presidential election is that the ACA will be the ""rule of the land"" and its continued evolutions have put additional stresses on providers of every discipline and size. Namely, providers of health care can expect the following changes:' Medicare volumes: The ACA will reduce payments to providers by $741 billion, of which $300 billion will be in Medicare and Medicaid cuts directly impacting hospitals. In reaction, providers must decide how to limit Medicare patient volumes, find efficiencies in the treatment of Medicare volumes, or eliminate chosen services to Medicare patients all together. Expense reduction: As revenues are further jeopardized, providers must look closer at controllable expenditures and question the return on dollars spent. Providers must consider the ""value gap"" as well -- where cost increases have outpaced the increases of quality of care. Stakeholders are demanding better quality at lower costs and providers must respond accordingly. Operational efficiency: In response to reductions in revenue and expenses, providers must improve outcomes, reduce redundancies, and find alternative delivery models to treat patients in more economical manners with minimal or no sacrificing of patient outcomes. Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB): One of the most highly publicized sources of the ACA's potential economic impact is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the 15-member board of unelected health-care experts designed to provide Congress with cost-cutting recommendations when Medicare spending hits a certain level. The IPAB, a panel of nonelected health-care experts, became the bogeyman of the ACA in 2009 when Sarah Palin touted the IPAB as the ""death panel."" The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects IPAB will save Medicare $16 billion over 10 years and, by necessity, a subset of providers would receive the brunt of the cuts. IPAB is not permitted to recommend changes to beneficiary premiums, cost-sharing, or eligibility rules. It cannot recommend a reduction to Medicare benefits, an increase in taxes, or any reductions to payments to some providers. This leaves other providers -- Medicare part C; Medicare prescription drug plans (part D); skilled nursing facilities; home health, dialysis, ambulance, and ambulatory surgical center services; and durable medical equipment providers -- particularly vulnerable."
What are the major changes to medical insurance? How does the ACA affect Medicare?,"'Numerous other factors that are placing ''stress'' on health-care providers began prior to the ACA and remain an integral portion of reform. These include the following:''As the landscape changes, some of the key provisions that affect beneficiaries are as follows:' Value-based purchasing (VBP): VBP has its roots back in 2006 when Pay for Performance began. Today, as a cornerstone of health-care reform, VBP has evolved from simply reporting standards of care to providers' payments hinging upon quality. This involves a greater emphasis on primary and preventative care, greater attention to standardization of care, and greater patient participation in high-value health-care decisions. Changes in physician compensation models: In reaction to the emphasis on value and quality, institutions will be required to invest significantly in clinical decision support systems and realign their physician compensation to create incentives based on the value of care. We have already seen signs of this. For example, a 2012 New York Times article reported that, for the first time ever, NYC public hospitals will begin to link physician compensation to patient outcomes. Starting in 2015, Medicare will tie some physician payment to quality outcomes; however, most or all Medicare physician payments will be tied to quality outcomes in 2017. Mergers, acquisitions, and partners: Hospitals, physicians, and payers are all looking at the change in landscape in the marketplace, and questions of economies of scale emerge. Some providers need more advanced infrastructure to monitor and report quality initiatives while others have identified that making competitors partners or bringing complimentary services in house make good business sense in the current and future environment. Smaller providers are especially looking to become a part of systems with deeper pockets, and the independent physician practice will be virtually nonexistent in the future models. Ultimately, integration will be the key among significant players to provide superior care and create the operational efficiencies needed for organizations to continue moving forward. Commercial payers: As demonstrated in years past, commercial payers will adopt Medicare rules, especially when savings in payments or increases in quality can be realized. It is estimated that 5% of commercial payers have quality measures tied to payment today. In a survey conducted by Healthcare Financial Management Association, 80% of the respondents expect the commercial payers' payments to include at least some value-based payment mechanism within three to five years. Higher income tax: There will be a 0.9% tax to high-income workers who make more than $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. The ACA also includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers. Medicare beneficiaries will ultimately pay more for part B premiums: The ACA freezes the part B income thresholds at 2010 levels. These thresholds determine which beneficiaries will pay higher Medicare medical insurance (part B) premiums through 2019. The new provisions will increase the number and share of beneficiaries who pay the higher premium over time, while the percentage of beneficiaries who pay the higher premiums will increase from 5% in 2011 to 14% in 2019, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mergers, acquisitions, and partners: As hospitals, physicians, and payers respond to changes and form collective efforts, objections begin to surface in fear of monopolies. According to the New York Times profiled instances in which a consolidation created higher prices or resulted in less autonomy for physicians. A Nov. 2012 report by catalyst for payment reform argued that increased provider consolidations would create monopolies, driving cost increases and higher unit prices across the board. The Federal Trade Commission is on alert, however, and can challenge and block health system mergers that it believes would stifle competition. In the 2012 fiscal year, the FTC blocked 17 proposed health-care merger, acquisitions, or partnerships."
What are the benefits of the Affordable Care Act?,"'In response to these changes, hospital, health systems, and physicians will need greater emphasis on primary and preventative care, greater attention to standardization of care, and greater patient participation in high-value health-care decisions. This will require significant investment in clinical decisions support systems, realignment of the physician compensation models to create appropriate incentives as insurance requirements, and system-wide changes in patient management.'""Cost containment is vital and focus must be on where drivers are, namely chronic conditions, implantable devices, and pharmaceuticals. Forward-thinking organizations must look to decisions around cost containment and ultimately closing the value gap. It would appear, though, that closing the value gap is generally concentrating on one side of the equation. Providers overwhelmingly aim for their organizations' reputations to be based on high quality and patient satisfaction. Providers do not seek to be known as the low-cost provider in today's health-care environment.""""Ultimately, the ACA's goal is to increase the quality of health-care delivered as well as increase coverage to the uninsured. It is also the intent of the ACA and the other market drivers to sustain the Medicare program financially. As of May 31, 2013, it was estimated by the program's trustees that Medicare will be sustained until 2026, two additional years from previous estimates.""'Though the implementation of the ACA is in phases, the most significant reimbursement impacts to providers will begin in Oct. 2013 with changes in the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program. Providers have begun to react, however, in preparation for the changes on the horizon.''Editorial note by Charles P. Davis, MD, PhD''There are many specific questions that remain about the true cost and true benefits to those who provide and to those who need health care. Some of these questions are inferred by this general article. The answers to these questions should begin to come as each ACA phase quickly matures. If the ACA phase enhances the health care of most individuals without damaging the health-care system, ACA and its phase may be deemed a success. However, if ACA damages the health care of many individuals (for example, provides limited access to physicians, creates long waits for diagnostic tests, medical ''drugs'' become scarce commodities, or patients have poor health-care experiences) or damages the health-care system (for example, fewer doctors, a decline in the quality of medical-school applicants, spiraling costs, and hospital and emergency department closures), the ACA or that ACA phase will be considered a failure. That ACA phase will require quick and effective revision if quality health care is to survive and advance in the U.S. Many potential patients, doctors, and health-care professionals are concerned that provisions in the ACA may not be appropriately amenable to revisions if problems develop.''The ACA is 974 pages long and divided into 10 sections. While short summaries are useful to obtain some general understanding of this massive change in health care, for a more complete grasp of this law, it is best to read all of its details. Readers can find the complete ACA at the following site: ''http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf''.' "

Facts you should know about achalasia," Achalasia is a rare disease of the muscle of the lower esophageal body and the lower esophageal sphincter that prevents relaxation of the sphincter and 
	reduces contractions, or peristalsis, of the esophagus. The cause of achalasia is unknown; however, there is degeneration of the esophageal muscles and, more importantly, the nerves that control the muscles. Common symptoms of achalasia includedifficulty in swallowing (dysphagia),chest pain, andregurgitation of food and liquids. difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), chest pain, and regurgitation of food and liquids. Complications of achalasia include lung problems and weight loss. Achalasia may increase the risk of cancer of the esophagus, but this not well established. Achalasia can be diagnosed by X-ray, endoscopy, or esophageal manometry. Treatments for achalasia includeoral medications,dilation or stretching of the esophagus,surgery 
	(open and laparoscopic),
endoscopic surgery, andinjection of muscle-relaxing medicines (botulinum toxin) directly into the esophagus. oral medications, dilation or stretching of the esophagus, surgery 
	(open and laparoscopic), endoscopic surgery, and injection of muscle-relaxing medicines (botulinum toxin) directly into the esophagus. There is no specific diet to treat achalasia. However, some patients learn what foods seem to pass through the esophagus more easily, and make dietary alterations to include those foods in their diet, for example:drinking liquid foodsdrinking more water with meals, anddrinking carbonated beverages (the carbonation seems to help ""push"" the food through the esophageal sphincter). drinking liquid foods drinking more water with meals, and drinking carbonated beverages (the carbonation seems to help ""push"" the food through the esophageal sphincter). If a person with achalasia has weight loss that is substantial; their diet may be supplemented by a liquid diet that is complete (contains all necessary nutrients to prevent malnutrition)."
What is the definition of achalasia?,'Achalasia can be defined as the lack of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and the presence of abnormal motility in the remainder of the esophagus.' 
What is achalasia?,"'Achalasia is a rare disease of the muscle of the esophagus (swallowing tube). The term achalasia means ""failure to relax"" and refers to the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (a ring of muscle situated between the lower esophagus and the stomach) to open and let food pass into the stomach. As a result, people with achalasia have ''difficulty swallowing'' food.  In addition to the failure to relax, achalasia is associated with abnormalities of esophageal peristalsis (usually complete absence of peristalsis), the coordinated muscular activity of the body of the esophagus (which comprises 90% of the esophagus) that transports food from the throat to the stomach. ''The esophagus has three functional parts. The uppermost part is the upper esophageal sphincter, a specialized ring of muscle that forms the upper end of the tubular esophagus and separates the esophagus from the throat. The upper sphincter remains closed most of the time to prevent food in the main part of the esophagus from backing up into the throat. The main part of the esophagus is referred to as the body of the esophagus, a long, muscular tube approximately 20 cm (8 in) in length. The third functional part of the esophagus is the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of specialized esophageal muscle at the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. Like the upper sphincter, the lower sphincter remains closed most of the time to prevent food and acid from backing up into the body of the esophagus from the stomach.''The upper sphincter relaxes with swallowing to allow food and saliva to pass from the throat into the esophageal body. The muscle in the upper esophagus just below the upper sphincter then contracts, squeezing food and saliva further down into the esophageal body. The ring-like contraction of the muscle progresses down the body of the esophagus, propelling the food and saliva towards the stomach. (The progression of the muscular contraction through the esophageal body is referred to as a peristaltic wave.). By the time the peristaltic wave reaches the lower sphincter, the sphincter has opened, and the food passes into the stomach.''In achalasia, there is an inability of the lower sphincter to relax and open to let food pass into the stomach. In at least half of the patients, the lower sphincter resting pressure (the pressure in the lower sphincter when the patient is not swallowing) also is abnormally high. In addition to the abnormalities of the lower sphincter, the muscle of the lower half to two-thirds of the body of the esophagus does not contract normally, that is, peristaltic waves are less frequent or forceful and, therefore, food and saliva are not propelled down the esophagus and into the stomach. A few patients with achalasia have very high-pressure contractions  in the lower esophageal body following swallows, but these high-pressure waves are not effective in pushing food into the stomach. These patients are referred to as having ""vigorous"" achalasia. These abnormalities of the lower sphincter and esophageal body are responsible for food sticking in the esophagus.''Achalasia is viewed as consisting of three stages or types.  The earliest stage or type is considered to be when the sphincter does not open appropriately, and the contractions of the lower esophageal body are weak or intermittent.  ''Dysphagia'' is often mild, and patients learn how to adjust their eating habits to get around the problem.  If caught at this stage and treated appropriately, it is believed that the prognosis is excellent and later stages may be prevented.  Over time without treatment, it is believed that the destruction of the nerves and muscles as well as the obstruction posed by the sphincter leads to the development  of failure of the esophageal muscle to generate contractions and esophageal dilation, considered a second type of achalasia.  Vigorous achalasia is considered a third type.  In addition to sphincter dysfunction, high pressure contractions or spasms occur, which are possibly an attempt to overcome the obstruction caused by the tight sphincter.  The esophagus often is not greatly dilated.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of achalasia?,"'The symptoms of achalasia include:'   Difficulty swallowing food Difficulty swallowing both solid and liquid food Regurgitation of food that is retained in the esophagus. If this happens at night, food may be aspirated into the lungs, a serious medical problem Chest discomfort from esophageal dilation and/or retained food Sharp chest pain usually of unclear cause Heartburn; however, the heartburn is not characteristic of heartburn and is not helped by treatment for heartburn Loss of weight due to reduced intake of food"
What causes achalasia?,"'The cause of achalasia is unknown. Theories on causation invoke infection, heredity or an abnormality of the immune system that causes the body itself to damage the esophagus (autoimmune disease).''The esophagus contains both muscles and nerves. The nerves coordinate the relaxation and opening of the sphincters as well as the peristaltic waves in the body of the esophagus. Achalasia has effects on both the muscles and nerves of the esophagus; however, the effects on the nerves are believed to be the most important. Early in achalasia, inflammation can be seen (when a medical professional examines esophageal tissue under the microscope) in the muscle of the lower esophagus, especially around the nerves. As the disease progresses, the nerves begin to degenerate and ultimately disappear, particularly the nerves that cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. Still later in the progression of the disease, muscle cells begin to degenerate, possibly because of the damage to the nerves. The result of these changes is a lower sphincter that cannot relax and muscle in the lower esophageal body that cannot support peristaltic waves. With time, the body of the esophagus stretches and becomes enlarged (dilated).'  "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose achalasia?,"'The diagnosis of achalasia often is suspected on the basis of the history. Patients usually describe a progressive (worsening) of swallowing (dysphagia) for solid and liquid food over a period of many months to years. They may note regurgitation of food, chest ''pain'', or loss of weight. Rarely, the first symptom is aspiration ''pneumonia''.''Because patients typically learn to compensate for their dysphagia by taking smaller bites, chewing well, and eating slowly, the diagnosis of achalasia often is delayed by months or even years. The delay in diagnosis of achalasia is unfortunate because it is believed that early treatment -- before marked dilation of the esophagus occurs -- can prevent esophageal dilation and its complications.''The dysphagia in achalasia also is different from the dysphagia of esophageal stricture (narrowing of the esophagus due to scarring) and ''esophageal cancer''. In achalasia, dysphagia usually occurs with both solid and liquid food, whereas in esophageal stricture and ''cancer'', the dysphagia typically occurs only with solid food and not liquids, until very late in the progression of the stricture. The progressive worsening of the dysphagia, especially with ''cancer'', is more rapid.''The diagnosis of achalasia usually is made by an X-ray study called a video-esophagram in which video ''X-rays'' of the esophagus are taken after barium is swallowed. The barium fills the esophagus, and the emptying of the barium into the stomach can be observed. In achalasia, the video-esophagram shows that the esophagus is dilated (enlarged or widened), with a characteristic tapered narrowing of the lower end, sometimes likened to a ""bird\'s beak."" In addition, the barium stays in the esophagus longer than normal before passing into the stomach.''Another test, esophageal manometry, can demonstrate specifically the abnormalities of muscle function that are characteristic of achalasia, that is, the failure of the muscle of the esophageal body to contract with swallowing and the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. For manometry, a thin tube that measures the pressure generated by the contracting esophageal muscle is passed through the nose, down the back of the throat and into the esophagus. In a patient with achalasia, no peristaltic waves are seen in the lower half of the esophagus after swallows, and the pressure within the contracted lower esophageal sphincter does not fall with the swallow. In patients with vigorous achalasia, a strong simultaneous contraction of the muscle may be seen in the lower esophageal body. An advantage of manometry is that it can diagnose achalasia early in its course at a time at which the video-esophagram may be normal.''Endoscopy also is helpful in the diagnosis of achalasia although it can be normal early in achalasia. Endoscopy is a procedure in which a flexible fiberoptic tube with a light and camera on the end is swallowed. The camera provides direct visualization of the inside of the esophagus. One of the earliest endoscopic findings in achalasia is resistance as the endoscope is passed from the esophagus and into the stomach due to the high pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter. Later, endoscopy may reveal a dilated esophagus and a lack of peristaltic waves. Endoscopy also is important because it excludes the presence of esophageal ''cancer'' and other causes of dysphagia.'""Two conditions can mimic achalasia, esophageal cancer and Chagas' disease (Chagas) of the esophagus. Both can give rise to video-esophageal and manometric abnormalities that are indistinguishable from achalasia. Fortunately, endoscopy usually can exclude the presence of cancer. If there is more concern, ""'computerized tomography'' (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of the lowermost esophagus can be done to identify ''cancers'' near the lower esophageal sphincter.'""Chagas' disease is an infection caused by the parasite, ""' Trypanosoma cruzi'', and is limited to Central and South America. It is passed to humans through ''insect bites'"" from the reduviid bug. The parasite is shed in the bug's feces at the time it is biting. Scratching the bite breaks the skin and allows the parasite to enter the body. The parasite spreads throughout the body but takes up primary residency in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, though it also often affects the muscle of the ""'heart''. In the gastrointestinal tract, the parasite causes degeneration of the nerves controlling the muscles and can lead to abnormal function anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. When it affects the esophagus, the abnormalities are identical to those of achalasia.'""Acute Chagas' disease occurs mostly in children. In those individuals who are seen at a much later time for problems of swallowing, the acute illness is long-gone. The diagnosis of Chagas' disease can be suspected if there is involvement of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as dilation of the small intestine or the colon, and the heart. The best method for making a diagnosis is by serological tests looking for antibodies in the blood against the parasite."" "
What is the treatment for achalasia?,"'Treatments for achalasia include oral medications, stretching of the lower esophageal sphincter (dilation), surgery to cut the sphincter (esophagomyotomy), and the injection of botulinum toxin (''Botox'') into the sphincter. All four treatments reduce the pressure within the lower esophageal sphincter to allow easier passage of food from the esophagus into the stomach.'  "
"Diet, oral medications, and botulinum toxin (Botox) to treat achalasia","'There is no specific diet for treating achalasia, though dietary alterations often are made by patients as they learn what foods seem to pass more easily.  Usually, the more liquid foods pass more easily, and patients sometimes drink more water with their meals.  Early in the progression of the disease they may find that carbonated liquids help food pass, probably because of the increased intra-esophageal pressure caused by the carbonation that ""pushes"" food through the sphincter.  If loss of weight is substantial it is reasonable to supplement food with a liquid diet supplement that is complete, i.e., contains all necessary nutrients, to prevent malnutrition.''Oral medications that help to relax the lower esophageal sphincter include groups of ''drugs'' called ''nitrates'', for example, ''isosorbide dinitrate'' (''Isordil'') and ''calcium channel blockers'' (''CCBs''), for example, ''nifedipine'' (''Procardia'') and ''verapamil'' (''Calan''). Although some patients with achalasia, particularly early in the disease, have improvement of symptoms with medications, most do not. By themselves, oral medications are likely to provide only short-term and not long-term relief of the symptoms of achalasia, and many patients experience side-effects from the medications.''Another treatment for achalasia is the endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the lower sphincter to weaken it. Injection is quick, nonsurgical, and requires no hospitalization. Treatment with botulinum toxin is safe, but the effects on the sphincter often last only for months, and additional injections with botulinum toxin may be necessary. Injection is a good option for patients who are very elderly or are at high risk for surgery, for example, patients with severe heart or lung disease. It also allows patients who have lost substantial weight to eat and improve their nutritional status prior to ""permanent"" treatment with surgery. This may reduce post-surgical complications.' "
Dilation and esophagomyotomy to treat achalasia,"'The lower esophageal sphincter also may be treated directly by forceful dilation. Dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter is done by having the patient swallow a tube with a balloon at the end. The balloon is placed across the lower sphincter with the help of X-rays, and the balloon is blown up suddenly. The goal is to stretch--actually to tear--the sphincter. The success of forceful dilation has been reported to be between 60% and 95%. Patients in whom dilation is not successful can undergo further dilations, but the rate of success decreases with each additional dilation. If dilation is not successful, the sphincter may still be treated surgically. The main complication of forceful dilation is rupture of the esophagus, which occurs 5% of the time. Half of the ruptures heal without surgery, though patients with rupture who do not require surgery should be followed closely and treated with antibiotics. The other half of ruptures require surgery. (Although surgery carries additional risk for the patient, surgery can repair the rupture as well as permanently treat the achalasia with esophagomyotomy.) Death following forceful dilation is rare. Dilation is a quick and inexpensive procedure compared with surgery, and requires only a short hospital stay.''The sphincter also can be cut surgically, a procedure called esophagomyotomy. The surgery can be done using an abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures in the abdomen. In general, the laparoscopic approach is used with uncomplicated achalasia. Alternatively, the surgery can be done with a large incision or laparoscopically through the chest. Esophagomyotomy is more successful than forceful dilation, probably because the pressure in the lower sphincter is reduced to a greater extent and more reliably; 80%-90% of patients have good results. With prolonged follow-up, however, some patients develop recurrent dysphagia. Thus, esophagomyotomy does not guarantee a permanent cure. The most important side effect from the more reliable and greater reduction in pressure with esophagomyotomy is reflux of acid (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' or ''GERD'""). In order to prevent this, the esophagomyotomy can be modified so that it doesn't completely cut the sphincter or the esophagomyotomy may be combined with ""'anti-reflux surgery'' (''fundoplication''). Whichever surgical procedure is done, some physicians recommend life-long treatment with oral medications for ''acid reflux''. Others recommend 24-hour esophageal acid testing with lifelong medication only if acid reflux is found.''Endoscopic myotomy, or POEM, is the most recent addition to the treatment modalities for achalasia.  During endoscopic myotomy, an endoscope passes through the mouth and into the esophagus.  The inner lining of the esophagus above the sphincter is punctured.  Instruments then pass through the endoscope and into the esophageal wall that allow the endoscopist to tunnel his or her way down the esophageal wall by cutting the muscles of the wall.   In patients with vigorous achalasia, the cutting can begin higher up in the esophagus so as to reduce the effect of the muscle in the distal esophagus above the sphincter that is contracting vigorously.  Reflux of acid frequently occurs following POEM and requires medical treatment.  In some situations, it may require additional anti-reflux surgery.  Experimental studies are evaluating endoscopic procedures for treating the reflux without having to do open or laparoscopic surgery.' "
What is a fever?,"""The definition of fever is an elevation in body temperature or a high body temperature. Technically, any body temperature above the normal oral measurement of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) or the normal rectal temperature of 99 F (37.2 C) is considered elevated. However, these are averages, and one's normal body temperature may actually be 1 F (0.6 C) or more above or below the average of 98.6 F. Body temperature can also vary up to 1 F (0.6 C) throughout the day."" Fever is not considered medically significant until body temperature is above 100.4 F (38 C), which is the temperature considered to be a fever by medical professionals. Anything above normal but below 100.4 F (38 C) is considered a low-grade fever. Fever serves as one of the body's natural infection-fighting defenses against bacteria and viruses that cannot live at a higher temperatures. For that reason, low-grade fevers should normally go untreated, unless accompanied by troubling symptoms or signs. Also, the body's defense mechanisms seem to work more efficiently at a higher temperature. Fever is just one part of an illness, many times no more important than the presence of other symptoms such as cough, sore throat, sinus congestion, fatigue, joint pains or aches, chills, nausea, etc. Fevers of 104 F (40 C) or higher may be dangerous and demand immediate home treatment and prompt medical attention, as they can result in delirium and convulsions, particularly in infants, children, and the elderly. Fever should not be confused with hyperthermia, which is a defect in your body's response to heat (thermoregulation), which can also raise the body temperature. This is usually caused by external sources such as being in a hot environment. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are forms of hyperthermia. Other causes of hyperthermia can include side effects of certain medications or medical conditions. Fever should also not be confused with hot flashes or night sweats due to hormonal changes during perimenopause (the time period around menopause). Hot flashes and night sweats cause a sudden and intense feeling of heat, and may be accompanied by flushing (skin redness and tingly feeling) and sweating, but are not the same thing as a fever."
What causes a fever?,"   Fever is the result of your immune system's response to a foreign invader. These foreign invaders include viruses, bacteria, fungi, drugs, or other toxins. These foreign invaders are considered fever-producing substances (called pyrogens), which trigger the body's immune response. Pyrogens signal the hypothalamus in the brain to increase the body temperature set point in order to help the body fight off the infection. Fever is a common symptom of most infections such as colds, flu, and gastroenteritis (also referred to as stomach flu), and thus a risk factor for fever is exposure to infectious agents.  Typical infections that may cause a fever include those of the ear, throat, lung, bladder, and kidney. In children, immunizations (such as vaccine shots) or teething may cause short-term low-grade fever. Autoimmune disorders (including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease), medication side effects, seizures, blood clots, hormone disorders, cancers, and illicit drug use are some non-infectious causes of fevers. Fever itself is not contagious; however, if the fever is caused by a viral or bacterial infection, the infection may be contagious."
What are the signs and symptoms of a fever?,"'A fever can cause a person to feel very uncomfortable. Signs and symptoms of a fever include the following:'   Temperature greater than 100.4 F (38 C) in adults and children Shivering, shaking, and chills Aching muscles and joints or other body aches Headache Intermittent sweats or excessive sweating Rapid heart rate and/or palpitations Skin flushing or hot skin Feeling faint, dizzy, or lightheaded Eye pain or sore eyes Weakness Loss of appetite Fussiness (in children and toddlers) Also important to note in children are symptoms that can accompany an infection, including sore throat, cough, earache, vomiting, and diarrhea With very high temperatures (>104 F/40 C), convulsions, hallucinations, or confusion is possible. Always seek medical attention for a high fever or if these symptoms occur."
How do health care professionals diagnose a fever?," Along with having generalized symptoms of a fever, taking one's temperature with a thermometer can confirm the diagnosis of a fever. A temperature greater than 100.4 F in adults or children is considered a fever. Different tests may be done by a doctor, such a blood and imaging tests, to determine the cause of a fever and if the cause of the fever needs to be treated."
How should someone take a temperature for fever?,"'Digital thermometers can be used to measure rectal, oral, or axillary (under the armpit) temperatures. The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' does not recommend use of mercury thermometers (glass), and they encourage parents to remove mercury thermometers from their households to prevent accidental exposure to this toxin.''Axillary temperatures are not as accurate as rectal or oral measurements, and these generally measure 1 degree lower than a simultaneously obtained oral temperature.'""Tympanic (ear) thermometers must be placed correctly in a child's ear to be accurate. Too much ""'earwax'' can cause the reading to be incorrect.''Eardrum temperature measurements are not accurate in small children and should not be used in children under 3 years (36 months) of age. This is especially true in infants below 3 months of age when obtaining an accurate temperature is very important.''People 4 years old and older can have their temperature taken with a digital thermometer under the tongue with their mouth closed.''Avoid hot or ''cold'' ''drinks'' within 15 minutes of oral temperature measurement to ensure correct readings.''The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends rectal temperature measurements for children and toddlers under 3 years of age, as this gives the most accurate reading of core temperature.''A rectal temperature will read approximately 1 degree higher than a simultaneously obtained oral temperature.' Place the tip of the digital thermometer in a child's armpit. Leave the thermometer in place about one minute or until one hears a beep to check a digital reading. Clean the thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol and rinse. Turn the thermometer on and place the tip of the thermometer as far back under the tongue as possible. The mouth should remain closed, as an open mouth can cause readings to be inaccurate. The thermometer should remain in place for about one minute or until one hears the beep. Check the digital reading. Clean the thermometer with soapy water or rubbing alcohol and rinse with cool water. Use a small amount of lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, on the end. Place the child or baby prone (belly-side down) on a firm surface, or place a child face up and bend his legs to his chest. After separating the buttocks, insert the thermometer approximately ½ to 1 inch into the rectum. Do not insert it too far. Hold the thermometer in place, loosely keeping one's hand cupped around the child's bottom, and keep one's fingers on the thermometer to avoid it accidently sliding further into the rectum. Keep it there for about one minute, until one hears the beep. Remove the thermometer, and check the digital reading. Label the rectal thermometer so it's not accidentally used in the mouth."
What is the treatment for a fever?,"'Generally, if the fever does not cause discomfort, the fever itself need not be treated. It is not necessary to awaken an adult or child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a doctor.''The following ''over-the-counter'' fever-reducing medications may be used at home:'   Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) can be used to lower a fever. The recommended pediatric dose can be suggested by the child's pediatrician. Adults without liver disease or other health problems can take 1,000 mg (two ""extra-strength"" tablets) every six hours or as directed by a physician. The makers of Tylenol state the maximum recommended dose of acetaminophen per day is 3,000 mg, or six extra-strength tablets per 24 hours, unless directed by a doctor. Regular-strength Tylenol tablets are 325 mg; the recommended dosage for these is two tablets every four to six hours, not to exceed 10 tablets per 24 hours. If your fever is accompanied by vomiting and you are unable to keep oral medications down, ask a pharmacist for acetaminophen suppositories, which are available without a prescription. Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) can also be used to break a fever in patients over 6 months of age. Discuss the best dose with a doctor. For adults, generally 400 mg to 600 mg (two to three 200 mg tablets) can be used every six hours as fever reducers. Naproxen (Aleve) is another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can temporarily reduce fever. The adult dose is two tablets every 12 hours. Aspirin should not be used for fever in children or adolescents. Aspirin use in children and adolescents during a viral illness (especially chickenpox and influenza, or flu) has been associated with Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a dangerous illness that causes prolonged vomiting, confusion, and even coma and liver failure."
What are home remedies for a fever?," An individual with a fever should be kept comfortable and not overdressed. Overdressing can cause the temperature to rise further. Tepid water (85 F [30 C]) baths or sponge baths are a home remedy that may help bring down a fever. Never immerse a person with a fever in ice water. This is a common misconception. Never sponge a child or an adult with alcohol; the alcohol fumes may be inhaled, causing many problems. Other home remedies for fever include staying hydrated. Drink plenty of water and fluids, and avoid alcohol or caffeinated beverages, which can contribute to dehydration. Popsicles can also be cooling and provide fluids while also soothing a sore throat if that is present. A fan to circulate air or an open window may be helpful, as well as applying a cool damp washcloth to the forehead. If you are caring for a child, make sure the child does not feel too cold."
When should you worry about fever?," A fever over 104 F/40 C in children and adults is considered dangerous. Seek medical attention immediately. Any child below 3 months of age who has a temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or greater should be seen by a physician. If a child or adult has a history or diagnosis of cancer, AIDS, or other serious illness, such as heart disease, diabetes, or is taking immunosuppressant drugs, medical care should be sought for a fever. Children with a fever who have signs and symptoms such as rash, sore throat, ear pain, stiff neck, drowsiness, fussiness, or headache should see a doctor. In addition, if a fever lasts more than one day in a child or toddler 2 years of age or under, or last more than three days in a child over age 2, seek medical care. Otherwise, observe the person with the fever. If he or she appears sick or has symptoms that would suggest a major illness, such as meningitis (headache, stiff neck, confusion, problems staying awake), urinary tract infection (shaking chills, back pain, burning with urination), pneumonia (shortness of breath, cough), or any other signs of a serious illness, contact a health care professional. Other symptoms that may be indicative of a severe illness include repeated vomiting, severe diarrhea, or skin rashes (that could be a sign of dengue fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, strep throat, or chickenpox). Fever blisters (herpangina) are small blisters that turn into ulcers, usually on the lips, mouth, or tongue; a virus causes fever blisters. When a child contracts this virus for the first time, the symptoms and the fever blisters can be quite severe. If the child is not eating or drinking, contact the child's pediatrician. Women who are pregnant should contact a doctor for a fever over 101 F (38 C). A fever during pregnancy that is accompanied by a rash and joint pain could be a sign of an infection that could affect the baby. Some infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), can cause congenital deafness and other problems in the baby. If a pregnant woman contracts the Zika virus (also called Zika fever), it may cause a birth defect called microcephaly (small head). On the other hand, if the fever accompanies a simple cold or virus, one can treat the fever as described above and be assured the fever is only a symptom of the illness. This is not to say one should ignore a fever. If there are other associated symptoms that are bothersome, contact a doctor. Some vaccines given in childhood can cause a low-grade fever within a day or two of getting the injection. This fever is usually self-limited and short-lived. If the reaction seems severe or the skin at the injection site is red, hot, and painful, contact the child's doctor. A low percentage of all children and toddlers between 18 months to 3 years of age will have a seizure (convulsion) with a high fever. Of those with a history of febrile seizure, some will have another seizure associated with another febrile (fever) episode. Febrile seizures, while frightening to the parents, are not associated with long-term nervous-system complications. Children used to be prescribed the antiseizure drug phenobarbital (Solfoton, Luminal) following a febrile seizure as a preventive measure (prophylaxis). This has not been shown to be beneficial and possibly may be harmful, so it is not recommended. Recurrent fever in children (three or more episodes of fever in a six-month period, with no apparent causative illness) can be a symptom of a few different illnesses, such as PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous ulcers, pharyngitis, and adenopathy) syndrome, cyclic neutropenia, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and others. See your child's pediatrician if fevers are recurrent. Recurrent, persistent, or chronic fever in adults may accompany immune-deficient fever of unknown origin (FUO), also known as neutropenic FUO, and HIV-associated FUO, as well as many other infectious conditions. Adults should see their doctors if they develop recurrent fever."
What kind of doctors treat a fever?,"'Any kind of doctor is able to treat a fever, but most likely when you have a fever you will see your family medicine specialist (also called a general practitioner) or internist, and your child will see a pediatrician. You may see an ''emergency medicine'' specialist in an emergency department.''If fever is due to a specific underlying or recurrent medical condition, you may see a specialist for that particular condition. For example, if a person has ''cancer'' and a fever, an oncologist may be consulted. A pregnant woman with a fever may see her obstetrician. Newborns with fever may see ''neonatal'' specialists. Patients with ''HIV/AIDS'' and fever may consult an infectious disease specialist.' "
What are complications of a fever?,"'While having a fever is generally very uncomfortable, a fever itself does not usually cause severe complications.''High fever (>103 F/40 C) or prolonged bouts of fever can lead to''It is important to seek treatment for the underlying cause of a fever in the situations described above. Many of the infections that can cause fever can lead to severe complications if untreated.'   seizures, hallucinations, and/or dehydration."
What is the prognosis for a fever?,"'The prognosis for a fever and how long it lasts depends on the cause. Most cases of fever are self-limited and resolve with symptomatic treatment. For example, a fever associated with a ''common cold'' usually only lasts two to three days. If fever is caused by influenza, most ''flu symptoms'' including fever go away in about a week. Depending on the cause, antibiotics or other appropriate medications may be used.''Fevers associated with severe infections, or in patients whose immune system is compromised (such as those with cancer, elderly people, ''newborn'' infants, patients with ''HIV/AIDS'', or people with autoimmune disorders), can be life-threatening.' "
3 Possible ways to prevent a fever,'Prevention'' of fever is possible only to the extent that the specific cause of the fever can be prevented. Most fevers are caused by infection. Avoiding sources of infection and maintaining good hygiene practices are the best way to prevent a fever.''Some ways to prevent the spread of infection include the following:' Proper hygiene: Wash hands frequently. Avoid contact with sick people. Make sure immunizations are up to date.

Facts you should know about an Achilles tendon rupture," The most common initial symptom of Achilles tendon rupture is a sudden snap at the lower calf, intense pain, and inability to point the foot downward. Prior tendon inflammation or irritation can predispose one to Achilles rupture. Immediately after an Achilles tendon rupture, walking will be difficult and one is unable to stand on their toes. In addition, the patient will complain of pain with ankle movement. Bruising and swelling around the lower calf into the ankle and foot may occur. Achilles tendon rupture most commonly occurs in middle age (ages 30-50), and may be associated with repeated strain and inflammation. Achilles tendon rupture has been reported with the use of corticosteroids, taken either by mouth or after injection near the tendon area. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin [Cipro], levofloxacin [Levaquin]) are associated with Achilles tendon rupture, especially patients with previous tendinitis. Achilles tendon rupture repaired with surgery may have a re-rupture rate of up to 5%. Those treated without surgery have a re-rupture rate as high as 40%."
Function of Achilles tendon,"'The Achilles tendon forms from two muscles in the back of the calk, the gastrocnemius and the soleus, about 15 cm to 6 inches above the ankle joint and spirals as it crosses the ankle joint to attach to the heel bone (calcaneus). A sheath surrounds the tendon, allowing it to glide easily as the ankle moves through its range of motion.''Since the calf muscles originate above the knee and the Achilles attaches below the ankle, the function of the muscle-tendon unit is critical for ''walking'' and ''running''. When the calf muscles contract, it causes the ankle to point the foot downward and the foot to turn inward and up). (See picture 1.)''The tendon needs to be strong. ''Running'"" and climbing stairs generates force inside the tendon equal to 10 times the body's weight."" "
Blood supply of Achilles tendon,"'The Achilles tendon receives its blood supply from many sources. Small blood vessels cross the tendon sheath to provide blood and nutrients to the tendon. The tendon sheath also has small arteries that help supply the tendon. However, there is a relative lack of blood supply in the lower part of the tendon just above where it inserts into the heel and it is possible that this relative lack of blood flow is associated with the location of the tendon rupture.' "
What is an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'Rupture of the Achilles tendon is not uncommon in healthy, active individuals. The rupture is typically spontaneous and most commonly observed in individuals in between 24-45 years of age. The majority have had no prior history of ''pain'' or previous injury to the tendon. In the majority of cases, rupture of the Achilles tendon occurs 2-6 cm above the insertion of the tendon into the heel bone.''Risk factors for Achilles rupture include poor conditioning, ''corticosteroids'' medications (either taken by mouth or injected near the tendon), fluoroquinolone antibiotics (''ciprofloxacin'', ''levofloxacin''), and overuse. A previous ''ruptured Achilles tendon'' increases the risk for another, both on the side that was initially hurt, and on the other unaffected side.''Most commonly, the Achilles ruptures when there is a sudden, forceful movement of the foot downward against resistance, such as when an individual pushes off the foot with great force to jump. This often occurs in sports like basketball, tennis, or football.''The symptoms of a rupture include an acute sharp ''pain'' in the back of the heel and inability to plantarflex the foot. The victim may remember ''hearing'' a snap when the injury occurred. Because there is an imbalance between the muscles that push the toes down and those that pull them up, walking becomes difficult with the pain and because the foot will drag.''Sometimes the tendon does not fully rupture but only a partially tears. The symptoms are the same as a complete tear, and a partial tear can progress to a complete rupture. While the Achilles tendon rupture usually occurs near the insertion in the heel, it can occur at any location along the course of the tendon (see picture 2).''There are other causes of pain at the back of the heel than Achilles tendon rupture. It may be due to retrocalcaneal ''bursitis'' where inflammation occurs within the sac that cushions the tendon as it passes the bony edge of the heel bone. Paratenonitis is inflammation of the tendon sheath that surrounds the length of the tendon. The treatment for ''bursitis'' and tenosis incorporates rest, ''exercise'', and occasionally physical therapy.''About 1 million athletes a year develop Achilles tendon inflammation or rupture. Achilles tendon rupture tends to occur in athletic people between ages 30 and 50 and mostly in men (6:1 men:women). There may be an anatomy reason for the predominance of men. Achilles tendons in women have a smaller area and are thinner and may there may not be enough force generated to cause rupture.' "
What causes an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'Underlying illness or disease may increase the risk of Achilles tendon injury. Examples include the following:''Some other risk factors for Achilles tendon injury also include the following:' Diabetes Thyroid disease Kidney failure Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) Gout Older age Activities or sports that involve running and jumping Lack of flexibility Excessive activity (overuse) Sudden changes in intensity of exercise Poor conditioning Corticosteroid use (either by mouth or by injection) Fluoroquinolone antibiotics Poorly fitting shoes Jogging or running on hard surfaces Hill climbing or stair walking Previous Achilles tendon injury Family history"
What are Achilles tendon rupture symptoms and signs?,"   Patients with an Achilles tendon rupture will often complain of a sudden snap in the back of the leg. The pain is often intense and patients will describe it as if being shot. With a complete rupture, the individual will only be able to ambulate with a limp. Most people will not be able to climb stairs, run, or stand on their toes. Swelling around the lower calf may occur. Patients may offer a history of recent sudden increase in exercise or intensity of activity. Some patients may have had recent corticosteroid injection or prescription or a course of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Some athletes may have had a prior tendon inflammation or injury. The health care provider will generally examine both legs. A health care professionals examines the lower leg for swelling, bruising, and tenderness. If there is a complete rupture of the Achilles tendon, a physician can palpate a gap or defect within the tendon. Range of motion of the ankle will be lost and the patient will have difficult moving the ankle and foot. The Thompson test helps confirm the diagnosis:The patient lies prone, face-down.The examiner squeezes the calf area.With an intact Achilles tendon, the foot will plantarflex and the toes point downwardWith Achilles tendon rupture, the foot does not move The patient lies prone, face-down. The examiner squeezes the calf area.With an intact Achilles tendon, the foot will plantarflex and the toes point downwardWith Achilles tendon rupture, the foot does not move With an intact Achilles tendon, the foot will plantarflex and the toes point downward With Achilles tendon rupture, the foot does not move The health care provider may also check for pulses and sensation in the foot."
What tests help diagnose a ruptured Achilles tendon?,"""A health care professional makes a diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture by taking a patient's history and performing a physical exam as noted above. Imaging may be required to confirm the extent of tendon damage and to look for other associated injuries""'Plain ''X-rays'' of the foot may reveal swelling of the soft tissues around the ankle, other bone injury, or tendon calcification.''Ultrasound'' is the next most commonly ordered test to document the injury and size of the tear. For a partial tear of the Achilles tendon, the diagnosis is not always obvious on a physical exam and an ''ultrasound'' may be considered. A health care provider or by an ultrasound technician and radiologist may perform a bedside ultrasound.''MRI'': Health care providers often order an ''MRI'' when a diagnosis of tendon rupture is not obvious on ultrasound or a complex injury is suspected. MRI is an excellent imaging test to assess for presence of any soft-tissue ''trauma'' or fluid collection. More importantly, MRI can help detect presence of tendon thickening, bursitis, and partial tendon rupture.' "
What are treatment options for an Achilles tendon rupture?,"""Two options exist for Achilles tendon rupture, one involving surgical repair and the other a conservative treatment (allowing the tendon to heal on its own in a cast). Each has its benefits and risk and decisions will depend upon the patient's clinical situation, underlying medical background, the extent of the injury and the expectation of future activity.""'Surgery is the recommended treatment for the young, healthy and active individuals. For athletes, surgery is often the first choice of treatment. The Achilles tendon can be repaired surgically by either a percutaneous or open technique. With the open technique, a physician makes an incision to allow for better visualization and approximation of the tendon. With the percutaneous technique, the surgeon makes several small skin incisions to repair the tendon. Irrespective of type of treatment, a health care professional will apply a short leg cast or postoperative boot on the operated ankle after completion of the procedure (picture 3). Each approach has its benefits and risks and the choice of surgery type is individualized for each specific patient.''The advantages of a surgical approach includes a decreased risk of re-rupture rate (0%-5%); the majority of individuals can return to their original sporting activities (within a short time), and most regain their strength and endurance.''Disadvantages of a surgical approach include cost, the need for hospitalization and ''wound'' complications (for example, skin sloughing, infection, sinus tract formation, nerve injury''Nonsurgical method may be recommended for patients who are older, less active, and have a higher risk for surgery and anesthetic. Ability to heal wounds is also an important consideration and may include those with poor blood supply to their ''feet''. These include patients with ''peripheral artery disease'' and ''diabetes''.''Nonsurgical management involves application of a short leg cast to the injured leg, with the foot in a slightly downward flexed position. Maintaining the ankle in this position helps bring the ruptured tendon ends closer together to allow them to heal. The leg is placed in a cast for six to 10 weeks and no movement of the ankle is allowed. Walking is allowed on the cast after a period of four to six weeks. When the cast is removed, a small heel lift is inserted in the shoe to decrease the ''stress'' on the Achilles tendon for an additional two to four weeks. Following this, physical therapy is recommended.''The disadvantages of the nonsurgical approach includes an increased risk of re-rupture (up to 40%), prolonged immobilization in a cast, and increased technical difficulty should subsequent surgery be required.''The benefits include no need for anesthesia or hospitalization, decreased risk of skin breakdown and decreased risk of nerve damage.' "
What are possible complications of an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'The complications of Achilles tendon rupture include tendon scarring and decreased range of motion, as well as muscle ''weakness''.''Tendon re-rupture is a significant concern and can occur in up to 5% of surgically repaired patients and in some studies, up to 40% in conservatively treated patients.''Other complications related to surgery include skin sloughing, ''wound'' infection, nerve damage, and scarring.' "
"What is the 
recovery time for an Achilles tendon rupture?","'After surgery , the patient is kept in a cast for four to six weeks, This is followed by physical therapy and assisted range of motion exercises. A heel lift will be put in the shoe to prevent the excessive stretching of the tendon. Return to normal function is expected in four to six months.''With conservative treatment, serial casting occurs. Casts are changed every few weeks, with the foot being placed in less plantarflexion each time. This will occur for six to 12 weeks. After casting is complete and the tendon healed, physical therapy will continue to return range of motion and power. A shoe heel lift will be considered.'  "
"What rehabilitation exercises are recommended following an Achilles tendon 
rupture?","'Physical therapy and rehabilitation is necessary after injury to the Achilles tendon. For patients with partial rupture who are managed conservatively, rehabilitation should be started once the pain has diminished. Patients who undergo surgical repair of the Achilles tendon do not need physical therapy during the acute phase of healing, but it is highly recommended once the incision has healed.''Physical therapy is an important part of the post op recovery for the patient. After the cast is removed, the ankle is gently massaged and mobilized to reduce ''stiffness''. After two weeks, active exercises are undertaken. A total of 12-16 weeks of active physical therapy is required for the best results.''The goal of physical therapy is to return range of motion of the ankle leg muscle strength to normal. The physical therapist will individualize an ''exercise'"" program for the patient's specific needs to reach that goal."" "
Is it possible to prevent an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'To prevent Achilles tendonitis or rupture, the following tips are recommended:' Flexibility is an important goal of injury prevention. Pain is never normal. If calf or heel pain occurs, consider stopping the activity. If rest does not help and the pain recurs when the activity restarts, seek medical care. Let your health care provider know if you are experiencing calf muscle or tendon discomfort if you require medications. Try to wear good fitting shoes that are not too worn and are specific for the activity planned."
Are there any home remedies for an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'Achilles tendon injury requires medical attention, and though not all need surgery, there are no home remedies to cure this injury.' "
What is the prognosis of an Achilles tendon rupture?,"'When proper treatment and rehabilitation are undertaken, the prognosis is excellent. The majority of athletes can return to their previous exercise or sports. Those patients who undergo nonsurgical care have an increased risk of repeated rupture.' "
What is achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is a genetic (inherited) condition that results in abnormally short stature and is the most common cause of short stature with disproportionately short limbs. The average height of an adult with achondroplasia is 131 cm (52 inches, or 4 foot 4 inches) in males and 124 cm (49 inches, or 4 foot 1 inch) in females.''Although achondroplasia literally means ""without cartilage formation,"" the defect in achondroplasia is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to bone, particularly in the long bones.''Achondroplasia is one of the oldest known ''birth defects''. The frequency of achondroplasia is estimated to range from about 1 in 10,000 births in Latin America to about 12 in 77,000 in Denmark. An average figure worldwide is approximately 1 in 25,000 births.' "
What are the characteristics of achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is a distinctive condition that usually can be noted at birth.'   The baby with achondroplasia has a relatively long, narrow torso (trunk) with short extremities (arms and legs) and a disproportionate shortening of the proximal (near the torso) segments of the limbs (the upper arms and thighs). There is a typically large head with prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the midface with cheekbones that lack prominence, and a low nasal bridge with narrow nasal passages. The baby's fingers appear short and the ring and middle fingers may diverge, giving the hand a trident (three-pronged) appearance. Most joints can extend more than normal. For example, the knees can hyperextend beyond the normal stopping point. Not all joints are lax in this way. To the contrary, extension and rotation of the elbow are abnormally limited. Hip extension also tends to be limited. At birth there is often prominence of the mid-to-lower back with a small gibbus (a hump). With walking, the hump goes away and a pronounced sway (lordosis) of the lumbar region (the lower back) becomes apparent. The lumbar lordosis is persistent into adulthood.  The legs are bowed (genu varum). The baby exhibits some decrease in muscle tone (hypotonia). Because of the large head, especially compared to rest of the body, and the decreased muscle tone, the child with achondroplasia will run 
""behind schedule"" in reaching the usual motor developmental milestones. The schedule to which an achondroplastic child's development should be compared is not that for all children in the general population, but rather the growth charts and timetable followed by children with achondroplasia. Intelligence is generally normal in patients with achondroplasia. Enlargement of the brain (megalencephaly) is common and normal with achondroplasia."
How is achondroplasia diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of achondroplasia can be based on the typical physical features, the hallmarks of achondroplasia, evident at birth. Characteristic features are also seen by ''X-rays'', ''ultrasound'', and other imaging techniques. With ultrasound imaging, the diagnosis can sometimes be strongly suspected before birth.''The molecular diagnosis of achondroplasia before birth is possible if there is suspicion of the diagnosis or an increased risk (such as when a parent is affected by achondroplasia). In families in which both parents have achondroplasia, ''prenatal diagnosis'' may be particularly useful, the aim being to distinguish fatal homozygous achondroplasia (with two copies of the defective gene) from heterozygous achondroplasia (with one copy of the achondroplasia gene) from normal. Diagnosis before birth is accomplished by examining cells obtained by ''chorionic villus sampling'' (CVS) or ''amniocentesis''.' "
What can be done for patients with achondroplasia?,"'Children and adults with achondroplasia can lead normal lives provided they receive attentive, informed care by their physicians and parents. Considerations in monitoring children with achondroplasia include careful measurements of growth (length/height and weight) and head circumference using curves specially standardized for those with achondroplasia. Knowledgeable pediatric care and periodic orthopedic and neurologic examinations are critical.''When special problems complicate achondroplasia, prompt and expert intervention is important. For example:'   The foramen magnum (the large opening under the skull) may need to be surgically enlarged in cases of severe narrowing (stenosis) and compression of the spinal cord. When this opening is too narrow, the blood vessels and nerves are compressed, which can lead to central apnea (loss of breathing control). This is responsible for the risk of sudden death in infants 
(SIDS) with achondroplasia. The risk of sudden death for infants with achondroplasia is 2% 
to 5%. The back of individuals with achondroplasia can develop a marked sway (lordosis) to the lower back while abnormalities in the mid-back may cause a small hump (kyphosis) in infancy and compression of the spinal cord in adolescence. The spinal cord compression can require surgery to decompress it. Spinal stenosis is the most common medical complication of achondroplasia seen in adulthood. Orthopedic procedures may be performed for lengthening of the limb bones and correction of bowed legs (usually after full growth has been achieved). Surgery (lumbar laminectomy) is also indicated when spinal stenosis (narrowing) causes symptoms, which tends to be evident in young adults. Disproportion between the brain and the base of the skull can sometimes result in hydrocephalus (""water on the brain"") which needs to be promptly detected and treated by placement of a shunt to drain the excess fluid. The large head with achondroplasia increases the chance of bleeding within the baby's head during 
vaginal delivery. This should be taken into account in planning the birth and postnatal care, and Cesarean delivery 
(C-section) may be recommended for a fetus with achondroplasia. The brainstem (which contains a center for controlling respiration) may be compressed in achondroplasia and contribute to abnormal breathing. Pregnant women with achondroplasia should have their babies delivered by cesarean section, due to their characteristically small pelvis, and high risk of birth related trauma. Middle ear infections 
(otitis media) are frequent and can lead to mild to moderate hearing loss. Therefore, ear infections should be readily suspected and promptly and fully treated with antibiotics 
and/or ear tubes. Dental crowding is also common. Teeth should be straightened and, if necessary, removed to alleviate this problem. 
Control of obesity is essential, and obesity can be a significant problem in people with achondroplasia. The excessive weight gain usually occurs during childhood. When obesity is present, the back and joint problems that are characteristic of this condition worsen in severity. The child with achondroplasia must not be allowed to become overweight. Adults with achondroplasia should also monitor and control their weight. Treatment with human growth hormone, which is still considered experimental, has been preliminarily reported to increase the growth rate after treatment, but studies have not yet demonstrated that adult height is increased by this treatment."
How is achondroplasia inherited?,"'Achondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait whereby only a single copy of the abnormal gene (mutation) is required to cause achondroplasia. The gene for achondroplasia is fully penetrant, meaning that everyone who possesses it has achondroplasia. No one with the gene escapes achondroplasia. However, there is some variation in the expression of the gene, meaning that children with achondroplasia are not carbon copies of each other, although they may look alike to the untutored eye.''In only about an eighth of cases is the gene inherited from a parent who has achondroplasia. Rather, about seven-eighths of cases are due to a new mutation (a new change in the gene). This means that most cases of achondroplasia occur sporadically (out of the blue) and are the result of a new mutation in a sperm or ovum of one of the normal- appearing parents. The chance of a new mutation rises with the age of the father. As early as 1912 it was noted that sporadic (new) cases were more often last-born than first-born children. This fits with the fact that the chance of an achondroplastic birth has been shown to increase with paternal age (age of the father).' "
What if someone with achondroplasia has children?,"'Although most children with achondroplasia do not have an achondroplastic parent but have a new mutant gene for achondroplasia, they can still transmit the gene to their children, and the risk for passing that gene down to a child is 50% in each ''pregnancy''.' "
What if two people with achondroplasia have children?,"'People with achondroplasia sometimes have children together. If so, each parent has a 50:50 chance of passing on the gene. Thus, with each ''conception'', there is a 25% chance for an average-size child, a 50% chance for a child (like them) with achondroplasia and a 25% chance for a conception with two achondroplasia genes. The combined presence of two genes for achondroplasia (called homozygous achondroplasia) causes a grievous skeletal disorder that leads to early death from breathing failure due to constriction by a tiny chest cage and neurologic problems from ''hydrocephalus''.' "
What gene causes achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene which codes for a protein (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) that is important for the maintenance of bone and brain tissues. Two specific mutations in this gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. These mutations limit the process of ossification, or the formation of bone from cartilage. The FGFR3 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 in chromosome band 4p16.3.' "
What is GERD or acid reflux?,"'Gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly referred to as GERD or acid reflux is a condition in which the liquid content of the stomach regurgitates (backs up or refluxes) into the esophagus. The liquid can inflame and damage the lining (esophagitis) although visible signs of inflammation occur in a minority of patients. The regurgitated liquid usually contains acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach. (Pepsin is an enzyme that begins the ''digestion'' of proteins in the stomach.) The refluxed liquid also may contain bile that has backed-up into the stomach from the duodenum. The first part of the small intestine attached to the stomach. Acid is believed to be the most injurious component of the refluxed liquid. Pepsin and bile also may injure the esophagus, but their role in the production of esophageal inflammation and damage is not as clear as the role of acid.''GERD is a chronic condition. Once it begins, it usually is life-long. If there is an injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis), this also is a chronic condition. Moreover, after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped, the injury will return in most patients within a few months. Once treatment for GERD is begun it will need to be continued indefinitely although. However, some patients with intermittent symptoms and no esophagitis can be treated only during symptomatic periods.'""In fact, reflux of the stomach's liquid contents into the esophagus occurs in most normal individuals. One study found that reflux occurs frequently in normal individuals as in patients with GERD. In patients with GERD, however, the refluxed liquid contains acid more often, and the acid remains in the esophagus longer. It has also been found that liquid refluxes to a higher level in the esophagus in patients with GERD than normal individuals.""'As is often the case, the body has ways to protect itself from the harmful effects of reflux and acid. For example, most reflux occurs during the day when individuals are upright. In the upright position, the refluxed liquid is more likely to flow back down into the stomach due to the effect of gravity. In addition, while individuals are awake, they repeatedly swallow, whether or not there is reflux. Each swallow carries any refluxed liquid back into the stomach. Finally, the salivary glands in the mouth produce saliva, which contains bicarbonate. With each swallow, bicarbonate-containing saliva travels down the esophagus. The bicarbonate neutralizes the small amount of acid that remains in the esophagus after gravity and swallowing has removed most of the acidic liquid.''Gravity, swallowing, and saliva are important protective mechanisms for the esophagus, but they are effective only when individuals are in the upright position. At night during ''sleep'', gravity has no effect, swallowing stops, and the secretion of saliva is reduced. Therefore, reflux that occurs at night is more likely to result in acid remaining in the esophagus longer and causing greater damage to the esophagus.''Certain conditions make a person susceptible to GERD. For example, GERD can be a serious problem during ''pregnancy''. The elevated hormone levels of pregnancy probably cause reflux by lowering the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter (see below). At the same time, the growing fetus increases the pressure in the abdomen. Both of these effects would be expected to increase reflux. Also, patients with diseases that weaken the esophageal muscles, such as ''scleroderma'' or mixed connective tissue diseases, are more prone to develop GERD.' "
What causes GERD (acid reflux)?,"'The cause of GERD is complex and may involve multiple causes. Moreover, different causes may affect different individuals or even in the same individual at different times. A small number of patients with GERD produce abnormally large amounts of acid, but this is uncommon and not a contributing factor in the vast majority of patients. ''The factors that contribute to GERD are:''The action of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is perhaps the most important factor (mechanism) for preventing reflux. The esophagus is a muscular tube that extends from the lower throat to the stomach. The LES is a specialized ring of muscle that surrounds the lower-most end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach. The muscle that makes up the LES is active most of the time, that is, at rest. This means that it is contracting and closing off the passage from the esophagus into the stomach. This closing of the passage prevents reflux. When food or saliva is swallowed, the LES relaxes for a few seconds to allow the food or saliva to pass from the esophagus into the stomach, and then it closes again.''Several different abnormalities of the LES have been found in patients with GERD. Two of them involve the function of the LES. The first is abnormally weak contraction of the LES, which reduces its ability to prevent reflux. The second is abnormal relaxations of the LES, called transient LES relaxations. They are abnormal in that they do not accompany swallows and they last for a long time, up to several minutes. These prolonged relaxations allow reflux to occur more easily. The transient LES relaxations occur in patients with GERD most commonly after meals when the stomach is distended with food. Transient LES relaxations also occur in individuals without GERD, but they are infrequent.''The most recently-described abnormality in patients with GERD is laxity of the LES. Specifically, similar distending pressures open the LES more in patients with GERD than in individuals without GERD. At least theoretically, this would allow easier opening of the LES and/or greater backward flow of acid into the esophagus when the LES is open.''Hiatal hernias contribute to reflux, although the way in which they contribute is not clear. A majority of patients with GERD have hiatal hernias, but many do not. Therefore, it is not necessary to have a ''hiatal hernia'' in order to have GERD. Moreover, many people have hiatal hernias but do not have GERD. It is not known for certain how or why hiatal hernias develop.''Normally, the LES is located at the same level where the esophagus passes from the chest through a small opening in the ''diaphragm'' and into the abdomen. (The diaphragm is a muscular, horizontal partition that separates the chest from the abdomen.) When there is a hiatal ''hernia'', a small part of the upper stomach that attaches to the esophagus pushes up through the diaphragm. As a result, a small part of the stomach and the LES come to lie in the chest, and the LES is no longer at the level of the diaphragm.''It appears that the diaphragm that surrounds the LES is important in preventing reflux. That is, in individuals without hiatal hernias, the diaphragm surrounding the esophagus is continuously contracted, but then relaxes with swallows, just like the LES. Note that the effects of the LES and diaphragm occur at the same location in patients without hiatal hernias. Therefore, the barrier to reflux is equal to the sum of the pressures generated by the LES and the diaphragm. When the LES moves into the chest with a hiatal hernia, the diaphragm and the LES continue to exert their pressures and barrier effect. However, they now do so at different locations. Consequently, the pressures are no longer additive. Instead, a single, high-pressure barrier to reflux is replaced by two barriers of lower pressure, and reflux thus occurs more easily. So, decreasing the pressure barrier is one way that a hiatal hernia can contribute to reflux.''As previously mentioned, swallows are important in eliminating acid in the esophagus. Swallowing causes a ring-like wave of contraction of the esophageal muscles, which narrows the lumen (inner ''cavity'') of the esophagus. The contraction, referred to as peristalsis, begins in the upper esophagus and travels to the lower esophagus. It pushes food, saliva, and whatever else is in the esophagus into the stomach.''When the wave of contraction is defective, refluxed acid is not pushed back into the stomach. In patients with GERD, several abnormalities of contraction have been described. For example, waves of contraction may not begin after each swallow or the waves of contraction may die out before they reach the stomach. Also, the pressure generated by the contractions may be too weak to push the acid back into the stomach. Such abnormalities of contraction, which reduce the clearance of acid from the esophagus, are found frequently in patients with GERD. In fact, they are found most frequently in those patients with the most severe GERD. The effects of abnormal esophageal contractions would be expected to be worse at night when gravity is not helping to return refluxed acid to the stomach. Note that ''smoking'' also substantially reduces the clearance of acid from the esophagus. This effect continues for at least 6 hours after the last ''cigarette''.''Most reflux during the day occurs after meals. This reflux probably is due to transient LES relaxations that are caused by distention of the stomach with food. A minority of patients with GERD, about, has been found to have stomachs that empty abnormally slowly after a meal. This is called ''gastroparesis''. The slower emptying of the stomach prolongs the distention of the stomach with food after meals. Therefore, the slower emptying prolongs the period of time during which reflux is more likely to occur. There are several medications associated with impaired gastric emptying, such as:''Individuals should not stop taking these or any drugs that are prescribed until the prescribing doctor has discussed the potential GERD situation with them.'   lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities, hiatal hernias,  abnormal esophageal contractions, and slow or prolonged emptying of the stomach. narcotics,  tricyclic antidepressants,  calcium channel blockers (CCBs),  clonidine,  dopamine agonists,  lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), nicotine and progesterone."
What are the symptoms of uncomplicated GERD?,"'The symptoms of uncomplicated GERD are primarily:''Other symptoms occur when there are complications of GERD and willbe discussed with the complications.''When acid refluxes back into the esophagus in patients with GERD, nervefibers in the esophagus are stimulated. This nerve stimulation results mostcommonly in heartburn, the ''pain'' that is characteristic of GERD. Heartburnusually is described as a burning ''pain'' in the middle of the chest. It may starthigh in the abdomen or may extend up into the neck. In some patients, however,the pain may be sharp or pressure-like, rather than burning. Such pain can mimic''heart'' pain (''angina''). In other patients, the pain may extend to the back.''Sinceacid reflux is more common after meals, heartburn is more common after meals.Heartburn is also more common when individuals lie down because without theeffects of gravity, reflux occurs more easily, and acid is returned to the stomach more slowly. Many patients with GERD are awakened from ''sleep'' by heartburn.''Episodes of heartburn tendto happen periodically. This means that the episodes are more frequent or severefor a period of several weeks or months, and then become less frequent orsevere or even absent for several weeks or months. This periodicity of symptoms provides the rationale for intermittent treatment in patients with GERD who do not have esophagitis. Nevertheless, heartburn is alife-long problem, and it almost always returns.''Regurgitation is the appearance of refluxed liquid in the mouth. In most patients with GERD, usually only small quantities of liquid reach the esophagus, and the liquid remains in the lower esophagus. Occasionally in some patients with GERD, larger quantities of liquid, sometimes containing food, are refluxed and reach the upper esophagus.'""At the upper end of the esophagus is the upper esophageal sphincter (UES).The UES is a circular ring of muscle that is very similar in its actions to theLES. That is, the UES prevents esophageal contents from backing up into thethroat. When small amounts of refluxed liquid and/or foods get pastthe UES and enter the throat, there may be an acid taste in the mouth. If largerquantities breach the UES, patients may suddenly find their mouths filled withthe liquid or food. What's more, frequent or prolonged regurgitation can leadto acid-induced erosions of the ""'teeth''.''Nausea is uncommon in GERD. In some patients, however, it may be frequent orsevere and may result in ''vomiting''. In fact, in patients with unexplained nauseaand/or ''vomiting'', GERD is one of the first conditions to be considered. It is not clearwhy some patients with GERD develop mainly heartburn and others develop mainlynausea.' heartburn 
(sometimes interpreted as chest pain),  regurgitation,
and  nausea. 
	"
What are the complications of GERD?,"'The liquid from the stomach that refluxes into the esophagus damages the cells lining the esophagus. The body responds in the way that it usually responds to damage, which is with inflammation (esophagitis). The purpose of inflammation is to neutralize the damaging agent and begin the process of healing. If the damage goes deeply into the esophagus, an ulcer forms. An ulcer is simply a break in the lining of the esophagus that occurs in an area of inflammation. Ulcers and the additional inflammation they provoke may erode into the esophageal blood vessels and give rise to bleeding into the esophagus.''Occasionally, the bleeding is severe and may require:''Ulcers of the esophagus heal with the formation of ''scars'' (fibrosis). Over time, the ''scar tissue'' shrinks and narrows the lumen (inner ''cavity'') of the esophagus. This scarred narrowing is called a stricture. Swallowed food may get stuck in the esophagus once the narrowing becomes severe enough (usually when it restricts the esophageal lumen to a diameter of one centimeter). This situation may necessitate endoscopic removal of the stuck food. Then, to prevent food from sticking, the narrowing must be stretched (widened). Moreover, to prevent a recurrence of the stricture, reflux also must be prevented.'""Long-standing and/or severe GERD causes changes in the cells that line the esophagus in some patients. These cells are pre-cancerous and may, though usually, become cancerous. This condition is referred to as Barrett's esophagus and occurs in approximately 10% of patients with GERD. The type of ""'esophageal cancer'"" associated with Barrett's esophagus (""'adenocarcinoma'"") is increasing in frequency. It is not clear why some patients with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus, but most do not.""""Barrett's esophagus can be recognized visually at the time of an ""'endoscopy'"" and confirmed by microscopic examination of the lining cells. Then, patients with Barrett's esophagus can undergo periodic surveillance endoscopies with biopsies although there is not agreement as to which patients require surveillance. The purpose of surveillance is to detect progression from pre-""'cancer'' to more cancerous changes so that ''cancer'""-preventing treatment can be started. It also is believed that patients with Barrett's esophagus should receive maximum treatment for GERD to prevent further damage to the esophagus. Procedures are being studied that remove the abnormal lining cells. Several endoscopic, non-surgical techniques can be used to remove the cells. These techniques are attractive because they do not require surgery; however, there are associated with complications, and the long-term effectiveness of the treatments has not yet been determined. Surgical removal of the esophagus is always an option.""'Many nerves are in the lower esophagus. Some of these nerves are stimulated by the refluxed acid, and this stimulation results in pain (usually heartburn). Other nerves that are stimulated do not produce pain. Instead, they stimulate yet other nerves that provoke ''coughing''. In this way, refluxed liquid can cause coughing without ever reaching the throat! In a similar manner, reflux into the lower esophagus can stimulate esophageal nerves that connect to and can stimulate nerves going to the lungs. These nerves to the lungs then can cause the smaller ''breathing'' tubes to narrow, resulting in an attack of ''asthma''.''Although GERD may cause ''cough'', it is not a common cause of unexplained coughing. Although GERD also may be a cause of ''asthma'', it is more likely that it precipitates ''asthmatic'' attacks in patients who already have asthma. Although ''chronic cough'' and asthma are common ailments, it is not clear just how often they are aggravated or caused by GERD.''If refluxed liquid gets past the upper esophageal sphincter, it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx). The resulting inflammation can lead to a ''sore throat'' and ''hoarseness''. As with coughing and asthma, it is not clear just how commonly GERD is responsible for otherwise unexplained inflammation of the throat and larynx.''Refluxed liquid that passes from the throat (pharynx) and into the larynx can enter the lungs (aspiration). The reflux of liquid into the lungs (called aspiration) often results in coughing and choking. Aspiration, however, also can occur without producing these symptoms. With or without these symptoms, aspiration may lead to infection of the lungs and result in ''pneumonia''. This type of ''pneumonia'' is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. When aspiration is unaccompanied by symptoms, it can result in a slow, progressive scarring of the lungs (''pulmonary fibrosis'') that can be seen on chest ''X-rays''. Aspiration is more likely to occur at night because that is when the processes (mechanisms) that protect against reflux are not active and the coughing reflex that protects the lungs also is not active.''The throat communicates with the nasal passages. In small children, two patches of lymph tissue, called the ''adenoids'', are located where the upper part of the throat joins the nasal passages. The passages from the sinuses and the tubes from the middle ears (Eustachian tubes) open into the rear of the nasal passages near the adenoids. Refluxed liquid that enters the upper throat can inflame the adenoids and cause them to swell. The swollen adenoids then can block the passages from the sinuses and the Eustachian tubes. When the sinuses and middle ears are closed off from the nasal passages by the swelling of the adenoids, fluid accumulates within them. This accumulation of fluid can lead to discomfort in the sinuses and ears. Since the adenoids are prominent in young children, and not in adults, this fluid accumulation in the ears and sinuses is seen in children and not adults.'   blood transfusions, an endoscopic procedure (in which a tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to visualize the site of bleeding and to stop the bleeding), or surgical treatment."
How is GERD or acid reflux diagnosed and evaluated?,"'There are a variety of procedures, tests, and evaluation of symptoms (for example, heartburn) to diagnose and evaluate patients with GERD.'  "
Symptoms and procedures to diagnose GERD,"'The usual way that GERD is by its characteristic symptom, heartburn. Heartburn is most frequently described as a sub-sternal (under the middle of the chest) burning that occurs after meals and often worsens when lying down. To confirm the diagnosis, physicians often treat patients with medications to suppress the production of acid by the stomach. If the heartburn then is diminished to a large extent, the diagnosis of GERD is considered confirmed. This approach of making a diagnosis on the basis of a response of the symptoms to treatment is commonly called a therapeutic trial.''There are problems with this approach For instance, patients who have conditions that can mimic GERD, specifically duodenal or gastric (stomach) ulcers, also can actually respond to such treatment. In this situation, if the physician assumes that the problem is GERD, the cause of the ulcer disease would be missed such as a type of infection called  ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori''), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or ''NSAIDS'' (for example, ''ibuprofen''), can also cause ulcers and these conditions would be treated differently from GERD.'""Moreover, as with any treatment, there is perhaps a 20% placebo effect, which means that 20% of patients will respond to a placebo (inactive) pill or, indeed, to any treatment. This means that 20% of patients who have causes of their symptoms other than GERD (or ulcers) will have a decrease in their symptoms after receiving the treatment for GERD. Thus, on the basis of their response to treatment (the therapeutic trial), these patients then will continue to be treated for GERD, even though they do not have GERD. What's more, the true cause of their symptoms will not be pursued.""'Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (also known as esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy or ''EGD'') is a common way of diagnosing GERD. EGD is a procedure in which a tube containing an optical system for visualization is swallowed. As the tube progresses down the gastrointestinal tract, the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be examined.'""The esophagus of most patients with symptoms of reflux looks normal. Therefore, in most patients, endoscopy will not help in the diagnosis of GERD. However, sometimes the lining of the esophagus appears inflamed (esophagitis). Moreover, if erosions (superficial breaks in the esophageal lining) or ulcers (deeper breaks in the lining) are seen, a diagnosis of GERD can be made confidently. Endoscopy will also identify several of the complications of GERD, specifically, ulcers, strictures, and Barrett's esophagus. Biopsies also may be obtained.""'Finally, other common problems that may be causing GERD like symptoms can be diagnosed (for example ulcers, inflammation, or ''cancers'' of the stomach or duodenum) with EGD.'""Biopsies of the esophagus that are obtained through the endoscope are not considered very useful for diagnosing GERD. They are useful, however, in diagnosing cancers or causes of esophageal inflammation other than acid reflux, particularly infections. Moreover, biopsies are the only means of diagnosing the cellular changes of Barrett's esophagus. More recently, it has been suggested that even in patients with GERD whose esophagi appear normal to the eye, biopsies will show widening of the spaces between the lining cells, possibly an indication of damage. It is too early to conclude, however, that seeing widening is specific enough to be confidently that GERD is present.""'Before the introduction of endoscopy, an X-ray of the esophagus (called an esophagram) was the only means of diagnosing GERD. Patients swallowed barium (contrast material), and X-rays of the barium-filled esophagus were then taken. The problem with the esophagram was that it was an insensitive test for diagnosing GERD. That is, it failed to find signs of GERD in many patients who had GERD because the patients had little or no damage to the lining of the esophagus. The X-rays were able to show only the infrequent complications of GERD, for example, ulcers and strictures. X-rays have been abandoned as a means of diagnosing GERD, although they still can be useful along with endoscopy in the evaluation of complications.''When GERD affects the throat or larynx and causes symptoms of cough, ''hoarseness'', or ''sore throat'', patients often visit an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. The ENT specialist frequently finds signs of inflammation of the throat or larynx. Although diseases of the throat or larynx usually are the cause of the inflammation, sometimes GERD can be the cause. Accordingly, ENT specialists often try acid-suppressing treatment to confirm the diagnosis of GERD. This approach, however, has the same problems as discussed above, that result from using the response to treatment to confirm GERD.' "
GERD (acid reflux) tests,"'Esophageal acid testing is considered a ""gold standard"" for diagnosing GERD. As discussed previously, the reflux of acid is common in the general population. However, patients with the symptoms or complications of GERD have reflux of more acid than individuals without the symptoms or complications of GERD. Moreover, normal individuals and patients with GERD can be distinguished moderately well from each other by the amount of time that the esophagus contains acid.''The amount of time that the esophagus contains acid is determined by a test called a 24-hour ''esophageal pH test''. (pH is a mathematical way of expressing the amount of acidity.) For this test, a small tube (catheter) is passed through the nose and positioned in the esophagus. On the tip of the catheter is a sensor that senses acid. The other end of the catheter exits from the nose, wraps back over the ear, and travels down to the waist, where it is attached to a recorder. Each time acid refluxes back into the esophagus from the stomach, it stimulates the sensor and the recorder records the episode of reflux. After a 20 to 24 hour period of time, the catheter is removed and the record of reflux from the recorder is analyzed.''There are problems with using pH testing for diagnosing GERD. Despite the fact that normal individuals and patients with GERD can be separated fairly well on the basis of pH studies, the separation is not perfect. Therefore, some patients with GERD will have normal amounts of acid reflux and some patients without GERD will have abnormal amounts of acid reflux. It requires something other than the pH test to confirm the presence of GERD, for example, typical symptoms, response to treatment, or the presence of complications of GERD. GERD also may be confidently diagnosed when episodes of heartburn correlate with acid reflux as shown by acid testing.''pH testing has uses in the management of GERD other than just diagnosing GERD. For example, the test can help determine why ''GERD symptoms'' do not respond to treatment. Perhaps 10 to 20 percent of patients will not have their symptoms substantially improved by treatment for GERD. This lack of response to treatment could be caused by ineffective treatment. This means that the medication is not adequately suppressing the production of acid by the stomach and is not reducing acid reflux. Alternatively, the lack of response can be explained by an incorrect diagnosis of GERD. In both of these situations, the pH test can be very useful. If testing reveals substantial reflux of acid while medication is continued, then the treatment is ineffective and will need to be changed. If testing reveals good acid suppression with minimal reflux of acid, the diagnosis of GERD is likely to be wrong and other causes for the symptoms need to be sought.''pH testing also can be used to help evaluate whether reflux is the cause of symptoms (usually heartburn). To make this evaluation, while the 24-hour ph testing is being done, patients record each time they have symptoms. Then, when the test is being analyzed, it can be determined whether or not acid reflux occurred at the time of the symptoms. If reflux did occur at the same time as the symptoms, then reflux is likely to be the cause of the symptoms. If there was no reflux at the time of symptoms, then reflux is unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms.'""Lastly, pH testing can be used to evaluate patients prior to endoscopic or surgical treatment for GERD. As discussed above, some 20% of patients will have a decrease in their symptoms even though they don't have GERD (the placebo effect). Prior to endoscopic or surgical treatment, it is important to identify these patients because they are not likely to benefit from the treatments. The pH study can be used to identify these patients because they will have normal amounts of acid reflux.""'A newer method for prolonged measurement (48 hours) of acid exposure in the esophagus utilizes a small, wireless capsule that is attached to the esophagus just above the LES. The capsule is passed to the lower esophagus by a tube inserted through either the mouth or the nose. After the capsule is attached to the esophagus, the tube is removed. The capsule measures the acid refluxing into the esophagus and transmits this information to a receiver that is worn at the waist. After the study, usually after 48 hours, the information from the receiver is downloaded into a computer and analyzed. The capsule falls off of the esophagus after 3-5 days and is passed in the ''stool''. (The capsule is not reused.)'""The advantage of the capsule over standard pH testing is that there is no discomfort from a catheter that passes through the throat and nose. Moreover, with the capsule, patients look normal (they don't have a catheter protruding from their noses) and are more likely to go about their daily activities, for example, go to work, without feeling self-conscious. Because the capsule records for a longer period than the catheter (48 versus 24 hours), more data on acid reflux and symptoms are obtained. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether obtaining additional information is important.""'Capsule pH testing is expensive. Sometimes the capsule does not attach to the esophagus or falls off prematurely. For periods of time the receiver may not receive signals from the capsule, and some of the information about reflux of acid may be lost. Occasionally there is pain with swallowing after the capsule has been placed, and the capsule may need to be removed endoscopically. Use of the capsule is an exciting use of new technology although it has its own specific problems.''Esophageal motility testing determines how well the muscles of the esophagus are working. For motility testing, a thin tube (catheter) is passed through a nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus. On the part of the catheter that is inside the esophagus are sensors that sense pressure. A pressure is generated within the esophagus that is detected by the sensors on the catheter when the muscle of the esophagus contracts. The end of the catheter that protrudes from the nostril is attached to a recorder that records the pressure. During the test, the pressure at rest and the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter are evaluated. The patient then swallows sips of water to evaluate the contractions of the esophagus.''Esophageal motility testing has two important uses in evaluating GERD. The first is in evaluating symptoms that do not respond to treatment for GERD since the abnormal function of the esophageal muscle sometimes causes symptoms that resemble the ''symptoms of GERD''. Motility testing can identify some of these abnormalities and lead to a diagnosis of an esophageal motility disorder. The second use is evaluation prior to surgical or endoscopic treatment for GERD. In this situation, the purpose is to identify patients who also have motility disorders of the esophageal muscle. The reason for this is that in patients with motility disorders, some surgeons will modify the type of surgery they perform for GERD.''Gastric emptying studies are studies that determine how well food empties from the stomach. As discussed above, about 20 % of patients with GERD have slow emptying of the stomach that may be contributing to the reflux of acid. For gastric emptying studies, the patient eats a meal that is labeled with a radioactive substance. A sensor that is similar to a Geiger counter is placed over the stomach to measure how quickly the radioactive substance in the meal empties from the stomach.''Information from the emptying study can be useful for managing patients with GERD. For example, if a patient with GERD continues to have symptoms despite treatment with the usual medications, doctors might prescribe other medications that speed-up emptying of the stomach. Alternatively, in conjunction with ''GERD surgery'', they might do a surgical procedure that promotes a more rapid emptying of the stomach. Nevertheless, it is still debated whether a finding of reduced gastric emptying should prompt changes in the surgical treatment of GERD.''Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and regurgitation may be due either to abnormal gastric emptying or GERD. An evaluation of gastric emptying, therefore, may be useful in identifying patients whose symptoms are due to abnormal emptying of the stomach rather than to GERD.''The acid perfusion (Bernstein) test is used to determine if ''chest pain'"" is caused by acid reflux. For the acid perfusion test, a thin tube is passed through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the middle of the esophagus. A dilute, acid solution and a physiologic salt solution (similar to the fluid that bathes the body's cells) are alternately poured (perfused) through the catheter and into the esophagus. The patient is unaware of which solution is being infused. If the perfusion with acid provokes the patient's usual pain and perfusion of the salt solution produces no pain, it is likely that the patient's pain is caused by acid reflux.""""The acid perfusion test, however, is used only rarely. A better test for correlating pain and acid reflux is a 24-hour esophageal pH or pH capsule study during which patients note when they are having pain. It then can be determined from the pH recording if there was an episode of acid reflux at the time of the pain. This is the preferable way of deciding if acid reflux is causing a patient's pain. It does not work well, however, for patients who have infrequent pain, for example every two to three days, which may be missed by a one or two day pH study. In these cases, an acid perfusion test may be reasonable."" "
How is GERD (acid reflux) treated?,"'One of the simplest treatments for GERD is referred to as life-style changes, a combination of several changes in habit, particularly related to eating.'  "
Lifestyle changes and GERD (acid reflux) diet,"""As discussed above, reflux of acid is more injurious at night than during the day. At night, when individuals are lying down, it is easier for reflux to occur. The reason that it is easier is because gravity is not opposing the reflux, as it does in the upright position during the day. In addition, the lack of an effect of gravity allows the refluxed liquid to travel further up the esophagus and remain in the esophagus longer. These problems can be overcome partially by elevating the upper body in bed. The elevation is accomplished either by putting blocks under the bed's ""'feet'' at the head of the bed or, more conveniently, by sleeping with the upper body on a foam rubber wedge. These maneuvers raise the esophagus above the stomach and partially restore the effects of gravity. It is important that the upper body and not just the head be elevated. Elevating only the head does not raise the esophagus and fails to restore the effects of gravity.''Elevation of the upper body at night generally is recommended for all patients with GERD. Nevertheless, most patients with GERD have reflux only during the day and elevation at night is of little benefit for them. It is not possible to know for certain which patients will benefit from elevation at night unless acid testing clearly demonstrates night reflux. However, patients who have heartburn, regurgitation, or other symptoms of GERD at night are probably experiencing reflux at night and definitely should elevate their upper body when sleeping. Reflux also occurs less frequently when patients lie on their left rather than their right sides.''Several changes in eating habits can be beneficial in treating GERD. Reflux is worse following meals. This probably is so because the stomach is distended with food at that time and transient relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter are more frequent. Therefore, smaller and earlier evening meals may reduce the amount of reflux for two reasons. First, the smaller meal results in lesser distention of the stomach. Second, by bedtime, a smaller and earlier meal is more likely to have emptied from the stomach than is a larger one. As a result, reflux is less likely to occur when patients with GERD lie down to sleep.''Certain foods are known to reduce the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and thereby promote reflux. These foods should be avoided and include:''Fatty foods (which should be decreased) and ''smoking'' (which should be stopped) also reduce the pressure in the sphincter and promote reflux.''In addition, patients with GERD may find that other foods aggravate their symptoms. Examples are spicy or acid-containing foods, like citrus juices, carbonated ''beverages'', and tomato juice. These foods should also be avoided if they provoke symptoms.''One novel approach to the treatment of GERD is chewing gum. Chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. It is not clear, however, how effective chewing gum is in treating heartburn. Nevertheless, chewing gum after meals is certainly worth a try.'   chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, and caffeinated drinks."
GERD (acid reflux) medications,"'There are a variety of over-the-counter (for example, antacids and foam barriers) and prescription medications (for example, proton pump inhibitors, histamine antagonists, and promotility drugs) for treating GERD.''Despite the development of potent medications for the treatment of GERD, antacids remain a mainstay of treatment. Antacids neutralize the acid in the stomach so that there is no acid to reflux. The problem with antacids is that their action is brief. They are emptied from the empty stomach quickly, in less than an hour, and the acid then re-accumulates. The best way to take antacids, therefore, is approximately one hour after meals, which is just before the symptoms of reflux begin after a meal. Since the food from meals slows the emptying from the stomach, an antacid taken after a meal stays in the stomach longer and is effective longer. For the same reason, a second dose of antacids approximately two hours after a meal takes advantage of the continuing post-meal slower emptying of the stomach and replenishes the acid-neutralizing capacity within the stomach.''Antacids may be aluminum, magnesium, or calcium based. Calcium-based antacids (usually ''calcium carbonate''), unlike other antacids, stimulate the release of gastrin from the stomach and duodenum. Gastrin is the hormone that is primarily responsible for the stimulation of acid secretion by the stomach. Therefore, the secretion of acid rebounds after the direct acid-neutralizing effect of the calcium carbonate is exhausted. The rebound is due to the release of gastrin, which results in an overproduction of acid. Theoretically at least, this increased acid is not good for GERD.''Acid rebound, however, has not been shown to be clinically important. That is, treatment with calcium carbonate has not been shown to be less effective or safe than treatment with antacids not containing calcium carbonate. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of acid rebound is theoretically harmful. In practice, therefore, calcium-containing antacids such as ''Tums'' and Rolaids are not recommended for frequent use. The occasional use of these calcium carbonate-containing antacids, however, is not believed to be harmful. The advantages of calcium carbonate-containing antacids are their low cost, the calcium they add to the ''diet'', and their convenience as compared to liquids.''Aluminum-containing antacids have a tendency to cause ''constipation'', while magnesium-containing antacids tend to cause ''diarrhea''. If ''diarrhea'' or ''constipation'' becomes a problem, it may be necessary to switch antacids, or alternatively, use antacids containing both aluminum and magnesium.''Although antacids can neutralize acid, they do so for only a short period of time. For substantial neutralization of acid throughout the day, antacids would need to be given frequently, at least every hour.''The first medication developed for more effective and convenient treatment of acid-related diseases, including GERD, was a histamine antagonist, specifically ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'""). Histamine is an important chemical because it stimulates acid production by the stomach. Released within the wall of the stomach, histamine attaches to receptors (binders) on the stomach's acid-producing cells and stimulates the cells to produce acid. Histamine antagonists work by blocking the receptor for histamine and thereby preventing histamine from stimulating the acid-producing cells. (Histamine antagonists are referred to as H2 antagonists because the specific receptor they block is the histamine type 2 receptor.)""'As histamine is particularly important for the stimulation of acid after meals, H2 antagonists are best taken 30 minutes before meals. The reason for this timing is so that the H2 antagonists will be at peak levels in the body after the meal when the stomach is actively producing acid. H2 antagonists also can be taken at bedtime to suppress nighttime production of acid.'""H2 antagonists are very good for relieving the symptoms of GERD, particularly heartburn. However, they are not very good for healing the inflammation (esophagitis) that may accompany GERD. In fact, they are used primarily for the treatment of heartburn in GERD that is not associated with inflammation or complications, such as erosions or ulcers, strictures, or Barrett's esophagus.""'Four different H2 antagonists are available by prescription, including  cimetidine (Tagamet), ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''), ''nizatidine'' (''Axid''), and ''famotidine'', (''Pepcid''). All four are also available over-the-counter (OTC), without the need for a prescription. However, the OTC dosages are lower than those available by prescription.''The second type of drug developed specifically for acid-related diseases, such as GERD, was a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), specifically, ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''). A PPI blocks the secretion of acid into the stomach by the acid-secreting cells. The advantage of a PPI over an H2 antagonist is that the PPI shuts off acid production more completely and for a longer period of time. Not only is the PPI good for treating the symptom of heartburn, but it also is good for protecting the esophagus from acid so that esophageal inflammation can heal.'""PPIs are used when H2 antagonists do not relieve symptoms adequately or when complications of GERD such as erosions or ulcers, strictures, or Barrett's esophagus exist. Five different PPIs are approved for the treatment of GERD, including omeprazole (Prilosec, Dexilant), ""'lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex''), ''pantoprazole'' (''Protonix''), and ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant). A sixth PPI product consists of a combination of omeprazole and ''sodium bicarbonate'' (''Zegerid''). PPIs (except for Zegarid) are best taken an hour before meals. The reason for this timing is that the PPIs work best when the stomach is most actively producing acid, which occurs after meals. If the PPI is taken before the meal, it is at peak levels in the body after the meal when the acid is being made.''Pro-motility drugs work by stimulating the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and/or colon. One pro-motility drug, ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''), is approved for GERD. Pro-motility drugs increase the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and strengthen the contractions (peristalsis) of the esophagus. Both effects would be expected to reduce reflux of acid. However, these effects on the sphincter and esophagus are small. Therefore, it is believed that the primary effect of metoclopramide may be to speed up emptying of the stomach, which also would be expected to reduce reflux.''Pro-motility drugs are most effective when taken 30 minutes before meals and again at bedtime. They are not very effective for treating either the symptoms or complications of GERD. Therefore, the pro-motility agents are reserved either for patients who do not respond to other treatments or are added to enhance other treatments for GERD.''Foam barriers provide a unique form of treatment for GERD. Foam barriers are tablets that are composed of an antacid and a foaming agent. As the tablet disintegrates and reaches the stomach, it turns into foam that floats on the top of the liquid contents of the stomach. The foam forms a physical barrier to the reflux of liquid. At the same time, the antacid bound to the foam neutralizes acid that comes into contact with the foam. The tablets are best taken after meals (when the stomach is distended) and when lying down, both times when reflux is more likely to occur. Foam barriers are not often used as the first or only treatment for GERD. Rather, they are added to other drugs for GERD when the other drugs are not adequately effective in relieving symptoms. There is only one foam barrier, which is a combination of aluminum hydroxide gel, magnesium trisilicate, and alginate (Gaviscon).' "
GERD surgery,"'The drugs described above usually are effective in treating the symptoms and complications of GERD. Nevertheless, sometimes they are not. For example, despite adequate suppression of acid and relief from heartburn, regurgitation, with its potential for complications in the lungs, may still occur. Moreover, the amounts and/or numbers of drugs that are required for satisfactory treatment are sometimes so great that drug treatment is unreasonable. In such situations, surgery can effectively stop reflux.''The surgical procedure that is done to prevent reflux is technically known as  ''fundoplication'' and is called reflux surgery or ''anti-reflux surgery''. During fundoplication, any hiatal hernial sac is pulled below the diaphragm and stitched there. In addition, the opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes is tightened around the esophagus. Finally, the upper part of the stomach next to the opening of the esophagus into the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophagus to make an artificial lower esophageal sphincter. All of this surgery can be done through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy) or using a technique called ''laparoscopy''. During laparoscopy, a small viewing device and surgical instruments are passed through several small puncture sites in the abdomen. This procedure avoids the need for a major abdominal incision.''Surgery is very effective at relieving symptoms and treating the complications of GERD. Approximately 80% of patients will have good or excellent relief of their symptoms for at least 5 to 10 years. Nevertheless, many patients who have had surgery will continue to take drugs for reflux. It is not clear whether they take the drugs because they continue to have reflux and symptoms of reflux or if they take them for symptoms that are being caused by problems other than GERD. The most common complication of fundoplication is swallowed food that sticks at the artificial sphincter. Fortunately, the sticking usually is temporary. If it is not transient, endoscopic treatment to stretch (dilate) the artificial sphincter usually will relieve the problem. Only occasionally is it necessary to re-operate to revise the prior surgery.''Very recently, endoscopic techniques for the treatment of GERD have been developed and tested. One type of endoscopic treatment involves suturing (stitching) the area of the lower esophageal sphincter, which essentially tightens the sphincter.''A second type involves the application of radio-frequency waves to the lower part of the esophagus just above the sphincter. The waves cause damage to the tissue beneath the esophageal lining and a ''scar'' (fibrosis) forms. The scar shrinks and pulls on the surrounding tissue, thereby tightening the sphincter and the area above it.''A third type of endoscopic treatment involves the injection of materials into the esophageal wall in the area of the LES. The injected material is intended to increase pressure in the LES and thereby prevent reflux. In one treatment the injected material was a polymer. Unfortunately, the injection of polymer led to serious complications, and the material for injection is no longer available. Another treatment involving injection of expandable pellets also was discontinued. Limited information is available about a third type of injection which uses gelatinous polymethylmethacrylate microspheres.''Endoscopic treatment has the advantage of not requiring surgery. It can be performed without hospitalization. Experience with endoscopic techniques is limited. It is not clear how effective they are, especially long-term. Because the effectiveness and the full extent of potential complications of endoscopic techniques are not clear, it is felt generally that endoscopic treatment should only be done as part of experimental trials.''Transient LES relaxations appear to be the most common way in which acid reflux occurs. Although there is an available drug that prevents relaxations (''baclofen''), it has side effects that are too frequent to be generally useful. Much attention is being directed at the development of drugs that prevent these relaxations without accompanying side effects.' "
What is a reasonable approach to the management of GERD (acid reflux)?,"'There are several ways to approach the evaluation and management of GERD. The approach depends primarily on the frequency and severity of symptoms, the adequacy of the response to treatment, and the presence of complications.''For infrequent heartburn, the most common symptom of GERD, life-style changes and an occasional antacid may be all that is necessary. If heartburn is frequent, daily non-prescription-strength (over-the-counter) H2 antagonists may be adequate. A foam barrier also can be used with the antacid or H2 antagonist.''If life-style changes and antacids, non-prescription H2 antagonists, and a foam barrier do not adequately relieve heartburn, it is time to see a physician for further evaluation and to consider prescription-strength drugs. The evaluation by the physician should include an assessment for possible complications of GERD based on the presence of such symptoms or findings as:''Clues to the presence of diseases that may mimic GERD, such as gastric or duodenal ulcers and esophageal motility disorders, should be sought.''If there are no symptoms or signs of complications and no suspicion of other diseases, a therapeutic trial of acid suppression with H2 antagonists often is used. If H2 antagonists are not adequately effective, a second trial, with the more potent PPIs, can be given. Sometimes, a trial of treatment begins with a PPI and skips the H2 antagonist. If treatment relieves the symptoms completely, no further evaluation may be necessary and the effective drug, the H2 antagonist or PPI, is continued. As discussed previously, however, there are potential problems with this commonly used approach, and some physicians would recommend a further evaluation for almost all patients they see.''If at the time of evaluation, there are symptoms or signs that suggest complicated GERD or a disease other than GERD or if the relief of symptoms with H2 antagonists or PPIs is not satisfactory, a further evaluation by endoscopy (EGD) definitely should be done.''There are several possible results of endoscopy and each requires a different approach to treatment. If the esophagus is normal and no other diseases are found, the goal of treatment simply is to relieve symptoms. Therefore, prescription strength H2 antagonists or PPIs are appropriate. If damage to the esophagus (esophagitis or ulceration) is found, the goal of treatment is healing the damage. In this case, PPIs are preferred over H2 antagonists because they are more effective for healing.'""If complications of GERD, such as stricture or Barrett's esophagus are found, treatment with PPIs also is more appropriate. However, the adequacy of the PPI treatment probably should be evaluated with a 24-hour pH study during treatment with the PPI. (With PPIs, although the amount of acid reflux may be reduced enough to control symptoms, it may still be abnormally high. Therefore, judging the adequacy of suppression of acid reflux by only the response of symptoms to treatment is not satisfactory.) Strictures may also need to be treated by endoscopic dilatation (widening) of the esophageal narrowing. With Barrett's esophagus, periodic endoscopic examination should be done to identify pre-""'malignant'' changes in the esophagus.''If symptoms of GERD do not respond to maximum doses of PPI, there are two options for management. The first is to perform 24-hour pH testing to determine whether the PPI is ineffective or if a disease other than GERD is likely to be present. If the PPI is ineffective, a higher dose of PPI may be tried. The second option is to go ahead without 24 hour pH testing and to increase the dose of PPI. Another alternative is to add another drug to the PPI that works in a way that is different from the PPI, for example, a pro-motility drug or a foam barrier. If necessary, all three types of drugs can be used. If there is not a satisfactory response to this maximal treatment, 24 hour pH testing should be done.''Who should consider surgery or, perhaps, an endoscopic treatment trial for GERD? (As mentioned previously, the effectiveness of the recently developed endoscopic treatments remains to be determined.) Patients should consider surgery if they have regurgitation that cannot be controlled with drugs. This recommendation is particularly important if the regurgitation results in infections in the lungs or occurs at night when aspiration into the lungs is more likely. Patients also should consider surgery if they require large doses of PPI or multiple drugs to control their reflux. It is debated whether or not a desire to be free of the need to take life-long drugs to prevent symptoms of GERD is by itself a satisfactory reason for having surgery.'""Some physicians - primarily surgeons - recommend that all patients with Barrett's esophagus should have surgery. This recommendation is based on the belief that surgery is more effective than endoscopic surveillance or ablation of the abnormal tissue followed by treatment with acid-suppressing drugs in preventing both the reflux and the cancerous changes in the esophagus. There are no studies, however, demonstrating the superiority of surgery over drugs or ablation for the treatment of GERD and its complications. Moreover, the effectiveness of drug treatment can be monitored with 24 hour pH testing."" cough, asthma, hoarseness, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, unexplained lung infections, or anemia (due to bleeding from esophageal inflammation or ulceration)."
What are the unresolved issues in GERD (acid reflux)?,"'One unresolved issue in GERD is the inconsistent relationships among acid reflux, heartburn, and damage to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis and the complications).''Clearly, we have much to learn about the relationship between acid reflux and esophageal damage, and about the processes (mechanisms) responsible for heartburn. This issue is of more than passing interest. Knowledge of the mechanisms that produce heartburn and esophageal damage raises the possibility of new treatments that would target processes other than acid reflux.''One of the more interesting theories that has been proposed to answer some of these questions involves the reason for pain when acid refluxes. It often is assumed that the pain is caused by irritating acid contacting an inflamed esophageal lining. But the esophageal lining usually is not inflamed. It is possible therefore, that the acid is stimulating the pain nerves within the esophageal wall just beneath the lining. Although this may be the case, a second explanation is supported by the work of one group of scientists. These scientists find that heartburn provoked by acid in the esophagus is associated with contraction of the muscle in the lower esophagus. Perhaps it is the contraction of the muscle that somehow leads to the pain. It also is possible, however, that the contraction is an epiphenomenon, that is, refluxed acid stimulates pain nerves and causes the muscle to contract, but it is not the contraction that causes the pain. More studies will be necessary before the exact mechanism(s) that causes heartburn is clear.''There are potentially injurious agents that can be refluxed other than acid, for example, bile. Until recently it has been impossible or difficult to accurately identify non-acid reflux and, therefore, to study whether or not non-acid reflux is injurious or can cause symptoms. ''A new technology allows the accurate determination of non-acid reflux. This technology uses the measurement of impedance changes within the esophagus to identify reflux of liquid, be it acid or non-acid. By combining measurement of impedance and pH it is possible to identify reflux and to tell if the reflux is acid or non-acid. It is too early to know how important non-acid reflux is in causing esophageal damage, symptoms, or complications, but there is little doubt that this new technology will be able to resolve the issues surrounding non-acid reflux.'   Why do only a few of the many episodes of acid reflux that occur in a patient with GERD cause heartburn? Why do some patients with mildly increased acid reflux develop heartburn, while other patients with the same amount of acid reflux do not? Why does heartburn usually occur in an esophagus that has no visible damage? Why is it that some patients with more damage to the esophagus have less heartburn than patients with no damage? Is heartburn not related to inflammation but rather to absorption of acid across the lining of the esophagus through widened spaces between the lining cells?"
What are GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and GER (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants and children?,"'Gastroesophogeal reflux (GER) is the upward flow of stomach contents from the stomach into the esophagus (""swallowing tube""). While not required by its definition, these contents may continue from the esophagus into the pharynx (throat) and may be expelled from the mouth, and in infants, through the nostrils.''Gastroesophogeal reflux is different from ''vomiting'' because usually it is not associated with a violent ejection. Moreover, GER is generally a singular event in time, whereas the ''vomiting'' process is commonly several back-to-back events that may ultimately completely empty all stomach contents and yet still persist (""dry heaves""). The difference between GER and GERD (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'') is a matter of severity and associated consequences to the patient.''The large majority of healthy, full term infants will have episodes of ""''spitting up''"" or ""''wet burps'',"" which technically qualify to be considered gastroesophogeal reflux. These infants generally do not seem in distress before, during, or after by the reflux process. Likewise, the loss of calories as an outcome of GER is inconsequential since growth parameters including weight gain are not affected. Lastly, there seem to be no short or long-term consequences of these reflux experiences. In short, infants with GER are ""''messy spitters''.""''GERD implies a much different condition. Infants and children with GERD often experience distress because of their reflux even if the refluxed stomach contents are not completely ejected from the mouth. Infants and young children may lose so many calories by expulsion that growth is compromised. Some infants or children with GERD may even become averse to feeding due to repeated associations with feeding and ''pain''. Finally, there are a number of short and long term consequences of GERD that are not associated with infants and children with GER.'  "
What are the symptoms of GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'Infants with GER generally have no symptoms other than the obvious reflux of fluid out the mouth. As mentioned previously, they do not appear to have any discomfort associated with their reflux.''Infants and children with GERD may have multiple symptoms including:'   frequent fussiness during feeding or thereafter, frequent or recurrent cough, especially when lying down or asleep, recurrent rejection of the breast or bottle which may lead to poor weight gain, wheezing, especially when lying down or asleep, recurrent pneumonia, and descriptions of ""heartburn,"" ""chest pain,"" or upper midline abdominal pain. Older children may have a bitter taste (similar to that associated with vomiting) in their mouth during reflex episodes"
What causes GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'Infants with gastroesophogeal reflux reflect the immaturity their nervous system. In most infants the junction between the esophagus and stomach is ""closed,"" opening only to allow passage of formula or breast milk into the stomach or to allow the escape of swallowed air via burping.''During episodes of reflux, this junction is continuously open allowing a backwards flow of stomach contents into the esophagus. This reverse flow may occur as a consequence of a relatively large volume of fluid relative to a smaller stomach volume, pressure on the abdominal cavity (for example, placed face down [prone] following a feeding), or overfeeding. Infant GER occurs in over 50% of healthy infants with a peak incidence (65%) at approximately 4 months of age. Most episodes resolve by 12 months of age. GER may occur in both ''breastfed'' and/or formula fed infants. Several studies document that breast fed infants empty their stomach faster than formula fed infants and are thus less likely to experience GER symptoms.''Gastroesophogeal reflux disease also reflects a relaxation of the esophageal-stomach junction similar to infant GER. Factors that may contribute to GERD in infants and children include:' Increased pressure on the abdomen (over eating, obesity, straining with stool due to constipation, etc.). Slower than normal emptying of stomach contents may predispose infants or children to GERD. Certain medications, foods, and beverages may also be implicated in facilitating such pathological reflux. Cured meats (salami, pepperoni) and carbonated and caffeinated drinks may aggravate GERD symptoms. Recent studies indicate that between 2% to 8 % of children 3 to 17 years of age experience GERD symptoms (detailed later)."
How are GER and GERD in infants and children diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of GER is based upon characteristic historical facts reported by the infant's parents coupled with an elimination of pathological conditions by a normal physical exam. It is very rare to need laboratory studies to establish or support the diagnosis. Part of the evaluation of an infant who may have GER is to rule out pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is the thickening of the region of the stomach (pyloris) as it transitions into the first section of the small intestine. Studies show that most infants with pyloric stenosis have recurrent symptoms of forceful emesis shortly after a meal. The child is generally content until just before vomiting. There is a genetic predisposition favoring the first-born male. Diagnostic evaluation includes abdominal ""'ultrasound'' or ''barium swallow'' (see below). A surgical procedure provides a cure of the condition.''Pediatricians diagnosis GERD in infants and children by taking a thorough history supported by a complete physical examination enabling the elimination of other conditions that might cause similar symptoms. While rare, studies may be necessary either to establish/support the diagnosis of GERD or to determine the extent of damage caused by the repeated reflux events.''These studies may include:' Barium swallow/upper GI series: This X-ray study involves drinking a material (barium) that allows visualization of the act of swallowing from mouth into the stomach by the propulsive motions of the esophagus and then emptying of the barium from the stomach into the upper part of the intestinal tract. This test is designed to confirm normal anatomy and function of the areas studies. pH probe studies: This test involves passage of a thin, flexible tube through the nose and into the lower regions of the esophagus. The goal is to document the frequency of reflux of stomach acid contents over a prolonged period (usually 24 hours). Endoscopy: Performed by a pediatric gastroenterologist, this procedure involves the passage of an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light source and camera at the leading end) from the throat, through the esophagus and into the stomach. Any damage that is caused by GERD because of stomach acid erosion can be seen through the scope. Erosion caused by refluxed stomach acid (esophagitis) is a characteristic finding. Gastric emptying study: This study involves drinking a mildly radioactive dye and monitoring the speed of passage from the stomach into the upper intestinal tract. Delay in emptying of stomach contents may predispose and aggravate GERD symptoms."
How are GER and GERD treated in infants and children?,"'Rarely, an infant with GER\xa0 generates substantial discomfort, demonstrate aversion to feeding, or show suboptimal weight gain. Conversely, toddlers and older children may experience more substantial symptoms, and thus may need a trial of lifestyle modifications including:''There are several groups of medications that may need to be considered in certain cases of infant GER (rare) or toddler/childhood GERD. These include:''The use of these medications follows a stepwise approach (from #1 to #4) based upon severity of symptoms. Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist may be helpful for patients whose response to the above approach is disappointing.''There are very cases where children whose GERD is so severe that a surgical procedure must be considered to manage symptoms. The procedure, called a Nissen ''fundoplication'', involves wrapping the top part of the stomach around the lower esophagus. The displaced stomach contracts during the digestive process, and thus closes off the lower esophagus and prevents reflux. In extraordinary circumstances, a feeding tube directly into the stomach is necessary to complement the Nissen fundoplication.'   mild elevation of the head of bed, serving smaller but more frequent meals, monitoring your child's diet to determine whether specific foods or drinks may tend to aggravate his or her symptoms, and weight reduction if indicated. Medication to lessen gas, for example, Mylicon or Gaviscon Medication to neutralize stomach acid, for example, Mylanta or Maalox Medication to lessen stomach acid histamine blockers, for example, ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid) or cimetidine (Tagamet), and proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, for example, omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid) or rabeprazole (Aciphex) Medication to promote emptying of stomach contents, for example, metoclopramide (Reglan, however, it has a number of side effects) or erythromycin (more routinely used as an antibiotic but known to have side the effect of increasing stomach contractions, but may be helpful with GERD)"
What natural or home remedies treat GER in infants?,"'Since the fundamental issue for infants with GER is ""tincture of time,"" most infants need no specific therapy. Lifestyle adjustments that have been helpful for some infants include:''Rarely, an infant may require medications to ''bridge'' the gap during the neurologic maturation process that enables your child to ""outgrow"" his or her GER. These medications are discussed later.' Mild elevation of the head of the crib mattress Maintaining an upright position for the first 20 to 30 minutes following a feeding Thickening of the formula with rice cereal Utilization of an ""elemental"" formula (for example, Alimentum) Introduction of solid foods at the safe and appropriate age (please check with your child's pediatrician prior to initiating these processes)."
What is the prognosis for GER and GERD in infants and children?,"'The prognosis for infants with GER is excellent. The majority of infants will have resolved their symptoms by 9 to 12 months of age. Infants who required medications during the first few months of life generally ""outgrow"" their medication during the end of the first year of life.''Children who experience GERD symptoms also have a favorable prognosis though it may require longer use of medications and utilization of life style changes for many months. It is important to note that classic ""heartburn"" symptoms may resolve, but more subtle evidence of reflux (for example, persisting cough, especially when laying face up [supine]) may develop. Your child\'s pediatrician is a valuable asset to help monitor for these less obvious presentations of GERD.' "
What is heartburn? What is acid reflux? Are they the same thing?,"'Acid reflux'' occurs when stomach acid backs up into the ''esophagus'' irritating the tissue.''Heartburn'', or ''acid indigestion'', is a symptom of acid reflux, so named because the esophagus lies just behind the heart, and that is where the burning sensation is felt.' "
What is the difference between heartburn and acid reflux?,"'Heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux. Heartburn describes a feeling of burning, ''pain'', or discomfort in the chest that can be quite uncomfortable. You also may a sour or bitter taste in the throat and mouth, and it usually occurs after you eat a big meal or when you lay down.''Not everyone with ''GERD'' will experience heartburn. Other ''symptoms of acid reflux'' include regurgitation of acid into the throat or mouth, a bitter taste in the mouth, ''upset stomach'', ''belching'', ''nausea'' after eating, feeling full, stomach and upper abdomen ''bloating'', dry ''cough'', ''wheezing'', ''hoarseness'', feeling of tightness in the throat, and in some people, ''vomiting''.' "
Differences between symptoms of heartburn vs. acid reflux,"'Heartburn, a symptom of acid reflux, and feels like'' a burning ''pain'' or discomfort in the chest, around the area of the heart.''Acid reflux may include heartburn symptoms. Other common symptoms of acid reflux include:''Acid reflux (''GERD'') and heartburn may cause ''chest pain'', when after eating or when lying down. See your doctor if you have any ''chest pain'' that is not diagnosed because chest pain may be a sign of a ''heart attack'' or another serious heart condition.

How can my doctor tell if I have heartburn or acid reflux?,"'A medical doctor can often diagnose GERD (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'') and heartburn by your description of the symptoms your experience.''You may see a gastroenterologist, a medical specialist in disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, who may order an ''upper GI series''. This is a series of ''X-rays'' of the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the intestine often used to rule out other health conditions. An upper GI ''endoscopy'', where a flexible probe with a tiny camera at the end is passed down your throat to see the esophagus. This helps diagnose how severe your acid reflux is, and can also rule out other health complications.''If your symptoms are not clearly from acid reflux, your doctor may perform other tests to rule out important conditions like heart attack, ulcers, lung problems, esophagus problems, and ''gastritis''.' "
How are heartburn and acid reflux treated?,"'If ''diet'' and lifestyle changes and OTC medications don’t make a difference in relieving your condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat your reflux and heartburn such as:'  Avoid eating close to bedtime. Don’t lie down soon after eating. Don’t eat large meals. Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day may make a difference. Avoid trigger foods that can aggravate symptoms such as fatty or greasy foods, chocolate, caffeine, mint, spicy foods, citrus, and tomato-based foods. Avoid alcohol. Don’t smoke. Lose weight, if overweight. Maintain good posture. Talk to your doctor if you take any medications that may cause symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn to see if there are alternatives. Do not stop taking any prescribed medications without first consulting your doctor. Over-the-counter antacids (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, and Gaviscon), or histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) [cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid)] may be used. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and pantoprazole (Protonix) Coating agents: sucralfate (Carafate) Promotility agents: metoclopramide (Reglan, Clopra, Maxolon) and bethanechol (Duvoid, Urabeth, Urecholine)"
Is there a cure for heartburn or acid reflux?,"'Most of the time, diet and lifestyle changes can help relieve or cure symptoms of acid reflux (GERD) and heartburn. In some cases over-the-counter or prescription ''drugs'' may be needed.''In rare cases, a last resort to cure acid reflux is a surgery called ''fundoplication''. During this surgery, a surgeon wraps part of the stomach around the esophagus like a collar, which works to increase pressure in the lower esophagus to keep acid from backing up.' "
What is acne?,"'Acne'' (''acne vulgaris'', common ''acne'') is a disease of the hair follicles of the face, chest, and back that affects almost all teenagers during ''puberty'' -- the only exception being members of a few primitive Neolithic tribes living in isolation. It is not caused by bacteria, although bacteria play a role in its development. It is not unusual for some women to develop ''acne'' in their mid- to late-20s.''Acne vulgaris is typical teenage acne which is characterized by three types of lesions:''Acne appears on the skin as''One can do a lot to treat acne using products available at a drugstore or cosmetic counter that does not require a prescription. However, for tougher cases of acne, one should consult a physician for treatment options.'   the comedo or blackhead; the inflammatory papule; and the pustule or pimple. occluded pores (""comedones""), also known as blackheads or whiteheads, tender red bumps also are known as pimples or zits, pustules (bumps containing pus), and occasionally as cysts (the deep pimples and boils of cystic acne)."
What causes acne?,"'No one factor causes acne. Acne occurs when sebaceous (oil) glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Sebum (oil) is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Associated with increased oil production is a change in the manner in which the skin cells mature, predisposing them to plug the follicular pore. The plug can appear as a ''whitehead'' if it is covered by a thin layer of skin, or if exposed to the air, the darker exposed portion of the plug is called a ""blackhead."" The plugged ''hair follicle'"" gradually enlarges, producing a bump. As the follicle enlarges, the wall may rupture, allowing irritating substances and normal skin bacteria access into the deeper layers of the skin, ultimately producing inflammation. Inflammation near the skin's surface produces a pustule; deeper inflammation results in a papule (pimple); if the inflammation is deeper still, it forms a ""'cyst''.'""Here are some factors that don't usually play a role in acne:""'In occasional patients, the following may be contributing factors:'   Food: Parents often tell teens to avoid pizza, greasy and fried foods, and junk food. While these foods may not be good for overall health, they don't play an important causal role in acne. Although some recent studies have implicated a high-carbohydrate diet, milk, and pure chocolate in aggravating acne, these findings are far from established. Dirt: Blackheads are oxidized oil, not dirt. Sweat does not cause acne and is produced by entirely separate glands in the skin. On the other hand, excessive washing can dry and irritate the skin. Stress: Some people get so upset by their pimples that they pick at them and make them last longer. Stress, however, does not play much of a direct role in causing acne. Heredity: If one of your parents had severe acne, it is likely that your acne will be more difficult to control. Pressure: In some patients, pressure from helmets, chin straps, collars, suspenders, and the like can aggravate acne. Drugs: Some medications may cause or worsen acne, such as those containing iodides, bromides, or oral or injected steroids (either the medically prescribed prednisone [Deltasone, Orasone, Prednicen-M, Liquid Pred] or the steroids that bodybuilders or athletes sometimes take). Other drugs that can cause or aggravate acne are anticonvulsant medications and lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid). Most cases of acne, however, are not drug-related. Occupations: In some jobs, exposure to industrial products like cutting oils may produce acne. Cosmetics: Some cosmetics and skincare products are pore-clogging (""comedogenic""). Of the many available brands of skincare products, it is important to read the list of ingredients and choose those which have water listed first or second if one is concerned about acne. These ""water-based"" products are usually best for those with acne."
What other skin conditions can mimic acne symptoms and signs?,"   Rosacea: This condition is characterized by pimples but not comedones and occurs in the middle third of the face, along with redness, flushing, and superficial blood vessels. It generally affects people in their 30s and 40s and older. Pseudofolliculitis: This is sometimes called ""razor bumps"" or ""razor rash."" When cut too close to the skin, growing hairs twist into the skin and produce tender bumps. This is a mechanical problem, and treatment involves shaving less (growing a beard, laser hair removal). Pseudofolliculitis can, of course, occur in patients who have acne, too. Folliculitis: Pimples can occur on other parts of the body, such as the abdomen, buttocks, or legs. These represent not acne but inflamed follicles. If these don't go away on their own, doctors can prescribe oral or external antibiotics, generally not the same ones used for acne. Gram-negative folliculitis: Some patients who have been treated with oral antibiotics for long periods of time develop pustules filled with bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics that were previously used. Bacterial culture tests can identify these germs, leading the doctor to prescribe different antibiotics or other forms of treatment."
When should someone start acne treatment?,"""Since everyone gets acne at some time, the right time to treat it is when it becomes bothersome or when the potential for scarring develops. This can be when severe acne flares suddenly, for mild acne that just won't go away, or even when a single pimple decides to show up the week before one's prom or wedding.""  "
How to get rid of acne (pimples),"'Moderation and regularity are good things, but not everyone can ''sleep'' eight hours, eat three healthy meals per day, and drink plenty of water a day. Probably the most useful lifestyle changes one can make is to ''never'' to pick or squeeze pimples. Playing with or popping pimples, no matter how careful and clean one is, nearly always makes bumps stay redder and bumpier longer. People often refer to redness as ""scarring,"" but fortunately, it usually isn\'t permanent. It\'s just a mark that takes months to fade if left entirely alone.''Occasional visits to an esthetician who is an expert at safely removing blackheads during a facial can be beneficial.''Despite what one might read in popular style and fashion magazines, there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and situation.''Benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of people, which goes away as soon as one stops using the product. Keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach, so do not let products containing benzoyl peroxide come into contact with fabrics, leaving unsightly white spots on colored clothes, shirts, towels, and carpets.''One cannot stop oil glands from producing oil. Even ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane, see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they resume normal activity later. It is possible to get rid of oil on the surface of the skin and reduce the appearance of shine.'   Mild cleansers: Washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid (for example, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Purpose, and Cetaphil are all inexpensive and popular) will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation. Exfoliating cleansers and masks: A variety of mild scrubs, exfoliants, and masks can be used. These products may contain salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a very mild peeling agent. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores. Products containing glycolic or alpha hydroxy acids are also gentle skin exfoliants. Retinol: Not to be confused with the prescription medication Retin-A, this derivative of vitamin A can help promote skin peeling. Antibacterial cleansers: The most popular ingredient in over-the-counter antibacterial cleansers is benzoyl peroxide. Topical (external) applications: Antibacterial cleansers come in the form of gels, creams, and lotions that are applied to the affected area. The active ingredients that kill surface bacteria include benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, and resorcinol. Some brands promoted on the Internet and cable TV (such as ProActiv) are much more costly than identical and sometimes more potent products one can buy in the drugstore. Use a gentle astringent/toner to wipe away oil. (There are many brands available in pharmacies, as well as from manufacturers of cosmetic lines.) Products containing glycolic acid or one of the other alpha hydroxy acids are also helpful in clearing the skin by causing the superficial layer of the skin to peel (exfoliate). Masks containing sulfur and other ingredients draw out facial oil. Antibacterial pads containing benzoyl peroxide have the additional benefit of helping to wipe away oil."
How does a doctor treat acne?,"""It's best to consult a primary care physician or dermatologist if an individual is unable to adequately control his or her acne. The goal of treatment should be the ""'prevention'' of scarring (not a flawless complexion) so that after the condition spontaneously resolves there is no lasting sign of the affliction. Here are some of the options available:'   Topical (externally applied) antibiotics and antibacterials: These include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Eryc, Ery-Tab, PCE, Pediazole, Ilosone), clindamycin (BenzaClin, Duac), sulfacetamide (Klaron), azelaic acid (Azelex or Finacea), and dapsone (Aczone). Retinoids: Retin-A (tretinoin) has been in use for years, and preparations have become milder and gentler while still maintaining its effectiveness. Newer retinoids include adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac). These medications are especially helpful for unclogging pores. Side effects may include irritation and a mild increase in sensitivity to the sun. Adapalene 0.1% is now available without a prescription. With proper sun protection, however, they can be used even during sunny periods. The combination medication is known as Epiduo gel -- which contains the retinoid, adapalene, along with the antibacterial, benzoyl peroxide -- is applied once a day. Oral medications: Doctors may start antibiotic treatment with tetracycline (Sumycin) or one of the related ""cyclines,"" such as doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox, and others) and minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin). Other oral antibiotics that are useful for treating acne are cefadroxil (Duricef), amoxicillin (Amoxil, DisperMox, Trimox), and sulfa drugs.Problems with these drugs can include allergic reactions (especially sulfa), gastrointestinal upset, and increased sun sensitivity. Doxycycline, in particular, is generally safe but can sometime cause esophagitis (irritation of the esophagus, producing discomfort when swallowing) and an increased tendency to sunburn.Despite the concern that the long-term use of tetracycline antibiotics for acne might ""weaken the immune system"" or induce bacterial resistance, these concerns seem to be unwarranted.Oral contraceptives: Oral contraceptives (birth control pills), which are low in estrogen to promote safety, have little effect on acne one way or the other. Some contraceptive pills have been shown to have modest effectiveness in treating acne. Those that have been U.S. FDA approved for treating acne are Estrostep, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, and Yaz. Most dermatologists work together with primary care physicians or gynecologists when recommending these medications.Spironolactone (Aldactone): This drug blocks androgen (hormone) receptors. It can cause breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities, and increased potassium levels in the bloodstream. It can help some women with resistant acne, however, and is generally well-tolerated in the young women who need it.Cortisone injections: To make large pimples and cysts flatten out fast, doctors inject them with a form of cortisone.Isotretinoin: Accutane was the original brand name; there are now several generic versions in common use, including Sotret, Claravis, and Amnesteem. Isotretinoin is an excellent treatment for severe, scarring, persistent acne and has been used on millions of patients since it was introduced in Europe in 1971 and the U.S. in 1982. It should be used for people with severe acne, chiefly of the cystic variety, that has been unresponsive to conventional therapies like those listed above. If taken in sufficient dosage, it should eliminate the need to continue the use of prescription drugs in most patients. The drug has many potential serious side effects and requires several unique controls before it is prescribed. This means that isotretinoin is not a good choice for people whose acne is not that severe but who are frustrated and want ""something that will knock acne out once and for all."" To use the drug, the prescribing physician, the patient, and the supplying pharmacy must be enrolled in the online ""iPLEDGE PROGRAM."" Used properly, isotretinoin is safe and produces few side effects beyond dry lips and occasional muscle aches. This drug is prescribed for five to six months at a dosage that has a high likelihood of preventing the return of acne. Fasting blood tests are monitored monthly to check liver function and the level of triglycerides, substances related to cholesterol, which often rise a bit during treatment but rarely to the point at which treatment has to be modified or stopped.Even though isotretinoin does not remain in the body after therapy is stopped, improvement is often long-lasting. It is safe to take two or three courses of the drug if unresponsive acne makes a comeback. It is, however, best to wait at least several months and to try other methods before using isotretinoin again.Isotretinoin has a high risk of inducing birth defects if taken by pregnant women. Women of childbearing age who take isotretinoin need two negative pregnancy tests (blood or urine) before starting the drug, monthly tests while they take it, and another after they are done. Those who are sexually active must use two forms of contraception, one of which is usually the oral contraceptive pill. Isotretinoin leaves the body completely when treatment is done; women must be sure to avoid pregnancy for one month after therapy is stopped. There is, however, no risk of childbearing after that time.Other concerns include inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of depression and suicide in patients taking isotretinoin. Recent evidence seems to indicate that these problems are exceedingly rare. Government oversight has resulted in a highly publicized and very burdensome national registration system for those taking the drug. This has reinforced concerns in many patients and their families have that isotretinoin is dangerous. Large-scale studies so far have shown no convincing evidence of increased risk for those taking isotretinoin compared with the general population. It is important for those taking this drug to report changes in mood or bowel habits (or any other symptoms) to their doctors. Even patients who are being treated for depression are not barred from taking isotretinoin, whose striking success often improves the mood and outlook of patients with severe disease. Problems with these drugs can include allergic reactions (especially sulfa), gastrointestinal upset, and increased sun sensitivity.

Light treatments: Recent years have brought reports of success in treating acne using special lights and similar devices, alone or in conjunction with photosensitizing dyes. It appears that these treatments are safe and can be effective, but it is not clear that their success is lasting. At this point, laser treatment of acne is best thought of as an adjunct to conventional therapy, rather than as a substitute. Chemical peels: Whether the superficial peels (like glycolic acid) performed by estheticians or deeper ones performed in the doctor's office, chemical peels are of modest, supportive benefit only, and in general, they do not substitute for regular therapy. Treatment of acne scars: For those patients whose acne has gone away but left them with permanent scarring, several options are available. These include surgical procedures to elevate deep, depressed acne scars and laser resurfacing to smooth out shallow acne scars. Newer forms of laser resurfacing (""fractional resurfacing"") are less invasive and heal faster than older methods, although results are less complete and the procedures may need to be repeated three or more times. These treatments can help, but they are never completely successful at eliminating acne scars."
Are there any home remedies for acne?,"   Cosmetics: Don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted cover-ups or even foundation, as long as it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). There are many quality products available. Facials: While not absolutely essential, steaming and ""deep-cleaning"" pores are useful, both alone and in addition to medical treatment, especially for people with ""whiteheads"" or ""blackheads."" Having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it oneself. Pore strips: Pharmacies now carry, under a variety of brand names, strips which one applies to the nose, forehead, chin, etc., to ""pull out"" oil from pores. These are, in effect, a do-it-yourself facial. They are inexpensive, safe, and work reasonably well if used properly. Toothpaste: One popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. There is no medical basis for this. The same applies to vinegar."
What is the best skin care routine for acne?,"'These are all good basic skin regimens that may help with the acne battle:'   Cleanse gently twice daily. Apply a gel or cream containing 5% benzoyl peroxide; an alternative is sulfur or resorcinol. Use a pad containing 2% salicylic acid to help exfoliation each morning. At night, apply a spot cream containing sulfur to the affected areas. Use a light skin moisturizer and water-based makeup."
How would you summarize current-day acne treatment?,"'Treating acne requires patience and perseverance. Any of the treatments listed above may take two or three months to start working (even isotretinoin). Unless there are side effects such as excessive dryness or ''allergy'', it is important to give each regimen or drug enough time to work before giving up on it and moving on to other methods. Using modern methods, doctors can help clear up the skin of just about everyone.'""Just hang in there. And don't pick. Please.""  "
What is rosacea? Is rosacea contagious? What does rosacea look like?,"'Rosacea (ro-zay-sha) is a common, ''acne''-like benign inflammatory skin disease of adults, with a worldwide distribution. Rosacea affects an estimated 16 million people in the United States alone and approximately 45 million worldwide. Most people with rosacea are Caucasian and have fair skin. The main symptoms and signs of rosacea include red or pink facial skin, small dilated blood vessels, small red ''bumps'' sometimes containing pus, ''cysts'', and pink or irritated eyes. Many people who have rosacea may just assume they have very sensitive skin that blushes or flushes easily.''Rosacea is considered an incurable auto-inflammatory skin condition that waxes and wanes. As opposed to traditional or teenage ''acne'', most adult patients do not ""outgrow"" rosacea. Rosacea characteristically involves the central region of the face, mainly the forehead, cheeks, chin, and the lower half of the nose. It commonly appears in people with light skin and particularly in those of English, Irish, and Scottish backgrounds. Some famous people with rosacea include the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and W.C. Fields. Alcohol intake does not directly cause rosacea, but it can be aggravated by it. Rosacea is not ''contagious'' or infectious.''The redness in rosacea, often aggravated by flushing, may cause small blood vessels in the face to enlarge (dilate) permanently and become more visible through the skin, appearing like tiny red lines (called telangiectasias). Continual or repeated episodes of flushing and blushing may promote inflammation, causing small red bumps, or ''papules'', that often resemble teenage ''acne''. Acne rosacea and adult acne are other names for rosacea. One of the most unpleasant aspects of rosacea is the overgrowth of dermal tissues producing a ""phymatous"" change in the skin. This appears as a thickening and permanent swelling of the facial tissues. A bulbous nose called rhinophyma is an example of this change.'  "
Is rosacea like acne?,"'Rosacea, although distinct from acne, does have some similarities. Unlike common acne, rosacea occurs most often in adults (30-50 years of age). Unlike ''acne vulgaris'', rosacea is devoid of ''blackheads'' and characteristically does not resolve after ''puberty''. Rosacea strikes both sexes and potentially all ages. It tends to be more frequent in women but more severe in men. It is very uncommon in children, and it is less frequent in people with dark skin.' "
What are causes and risk factors of rosacea?,"'The exact cause of rosacea is still unknown. The basic process seems to involve dilation of the small blood vessels of the face. Currently, health researchers believe that rosacea patients have a genetically mediated reduction in the ability to dampen facial inflammation that is incited by environmental factors such as ''sunburn'', demodicosis (''Demodex folliculorum'' in the hair follicles), flushing, and certain medications. Rosacea tends to affect the ""blush"" areas of the face and is more common in people who ''flush'' easily. Additionally, a variety of triggers is known to cause rosacea to flare. Emotional factors (''stress'', fear, ''anxiety'', embarrassment, etc.) may trigger blushing and aggravate rosacea. Changes in the weather, like strong winds, or a change in the humidity can cause a flare-up. Sun exposure and ''sun-damaged skin'' is associated with rosacea. ''Exercise'', alcohol consumption, ''smoking'"", emotional upsets, and spicy food are other well-known triggers that may aggravate rosacea. Many patients may also notice flares around the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's holidays.""'Rosacea risk factors include fair skin, English, Irish, or Scottish heredity, easy blushing, and having other family members with rosacea (called ""positive family history""). Additional risk factors include female gender, ''menopause'', and being 30-50 years of age.' "
What are rosacea symptoms and signs?,"'Typical signs and symptoms of rosacea include''The symptoms and signs of rosacea tend to come and go. The skin may be clear for weeks, months, or years and then erupt again. Rosacea tends to evolve in stages and typically causes inflammation of the skin of the face, particularly the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin.''When rosacea first develops, it may appear, then disappear, and then reappear. However, the skin may fail to return to its normal color, and the enlarged blood vessels and ''pimples'' arrive in time. Rosacea rarely resolves spontaneously.''Rosacea generally lasts for years, and if untreated, it\xa0gradually tends to worsen.'   facial flushing, blushing, skin redness (erythema), burning, red bumps and pustules, small cysts, and thickening of the facial tissue, especially the nose."
How long does facial flushing from rosacea last?,"'Early in the course of rosacea, facial flushing is transient, lasting for minutes to hours. Later, as the disease progresses, the flushing becomes permanent and the redness does not resolve.' "
Is it possible to prevent rosacea?,"'It is not possible to prevent rosacea, but it is possible to limit one’s exposure to triggering factors. Once a patient receives a diagnosis of rosacea, it is wise to avoid factors like spicy foods, hot liquids, ''smoking'', and irritating ''cosmetics'' that are known to trigger rosacea.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose rosacea?,"'Doctors usually diagnose rosacea based on the typical red or blushed facial skin appearance and symptoms of easy facial blushing and flushing. Rosacea is\xa0 underdiagnosed, and most people with rosacea do not know they have the skin condition. Many people may not associate their intermittent flushing symptoms with a medical condition. The facial redness in rosacea may be transient and come and go very quickly.''Dermatologists are physicians who have special training in the diagnosis of rosacea. Generally, no specific tests are required for the diagnosis of rosacea.''In unusual cases, a ''skin biopsy'' may be required to help confirm the diagnosis of rosacea. Occasionally, a dermatologist may perform a noninvasive test called a skin scraping in the office to help exclude a skin ''mite'' infestation by ''Demodex'', which can look just like rosacea (and may be a triggering factor). A skin culture can help exclude other causes of facial skin bumps like ''staph'' infections or ''herpes'' infections. Blood tests are not generally required but may help exclude less common causes of facial blushing and flushing, including systemic ''lupus'', other autoimmune conditions, carcinoid, and ''dermatomyositis''.''While most cases of rosacea are straightforward, there are some atypical cases that are not as easy to diagnose. Other skin diseases and rosacea look-alikes include''Recently, there has been an association noted between rosacea and certain auto-inflammatory diseases, including ''diabetes'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and ''cardiovascular disease''.' acne vulgaris, Demodex folliculitis, staph infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, medication reaction (for example, niacin), seborrheic dermatitis, allergic or contact dermatitis, eczema, seasonal allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, perioral dermatitis, carcinoid syndrome, dermatomyositis, impetigo, and herpes simplex."
How does rosacea affect the nose and the eyes?,"'The nose is typically one of the first facial areas affected in rosacea. It can become red and bumpy and develop noticeable dilated small blood vessels. Left untreated, advanced stages of rosacea can cause a disfiguring nose condition called rhinophyma (ryno-fy-ma), literally growth of the nose, characterized by a bulbous, enlarged red nose and puffy cheeks (like the classic comedian W.C. Fields). There may also be thick bumps on the lower half of the nose and the nearby cheek areas. Rhinophyma occurs mainly in men. Severe rhinophyma can require surgical correction and repair.''Some people falsely attribute the prominent red nose to excessive alcohol intake, and this stigma can cause embarrassment to those with rosacea.''Rosacea may affect the eyes. Not everyone with rosacea has eye problems. A complication of advanced rosacea, known as ''ocular'' rosacea, affects the eyes. About half of all people with rosacea report feeling burning, dryness, and irritation of the tissue lining of the eyes (''conjunctivitis''). These individuals may also experience redness of the eyelids and light sensitivity. Often the eye symptoms may go completely unnoticed and not be a major concern for the individual. Many times, the physician or ophthalmologist may be the first one to notice the eye symptoms. Untreated, ocular rosacea may cause a serious complication that can damage the ''cornea'' permanently damaging vision, called rosacea keratitis. An ophthalmologist can assist in a proper eye evaluation and prescribe rosacea eyedrops. Oral antibiotics may be useful to treat skin and eye rosacea.' "
What about using acne medicine for rosacea?,"'Since there is some overlap between acne and rosacea, some of the medications may be similar. Acne and rosacea have in common several possible treatments, including (but not limited to) oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, sulfa-based face washes, ''isotretinoin'"", and many others. It is important to seek a physician's advice before using random ""'over-the-counter'' acne medications since they can actually irritate skin that is prone to rosacea. Overall, rosacea skin tends to be more sensitive and easily irritated than that of common acne.' "
Does rosacea get worse with age?,"'Yes. Although rosacea has a variable course and is not predictable in everyone, it gradually worsens with age, especially if untreated. In small studies, many rosacea sufferers have reported that without treatment their condition had advanced from early to middle stage within a year. With good therapy, it is possible to prevent progression of rosacea.' "
What types of doctors treat rosacea?,'Dermatologists are most familiar with which option might be best for each individual. Ophthalmologists treat rosacea-related eye disease.' 
What is the treatment for rosacea?,"'There are many treatment choices for rosacea depending on the severity and extent of symptoms. Available medical treatments include antibacterial washes, topical creams, antibiotic pills, lasers, pulsed-light therapies, ''photodynamic therapy'', and isotretinoin.'""Mild rosacea may not necessarily require treatment if the individual is not bothered by the condition. Situations that are more resistant may require a combination approach, using several of the treatments at the same time. A combination approach may include prescription sulfa facial wash twice a day, applying an antibacterial cream morning and night, and taking an oral antibiotic for flares. A series of in-office laser, intense pulsed light, or photodynamic therapies may also be used in combination with the home regimen. It is advisable to seek a physician's care for the proper evaluation and treatment of rosacea.""  "
What topical medications treat rosacea?,"'With the proper treatment, patients can control rosacea symptoms and signs. Popular methods of treatment include topical (skin) medications applied by the patient once or twice a day. Topical antibiotic medication such as ''metronidazole'' (''Metrogel'') applied one to two times a day after cleansing may significantly improve rosacea. Azelaic acid (''Azelex'' cream, ''Finacea'' gel 15%) is another effective treatment for patients with rosacea. Both metronidazole and azelaic acid work to control the redness and bumps in rosacea.''Some patients elect combination therapies and notice an improvement by alternating metronidazole and azelaic acid: using one in the morning and one at night. Sodium sulfacetamide (''Klaron'' lotion) helps reduce inflammation. Other topical antibiotic creams include ''erythromycin'' and ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''). Topical ''ivermectin'' cream (Soolantra Cream, 1%) is also available.''Recently, a new topical prescription gel has become available designed to relieve the redness so characteristic of rosacea. ''Brimonidine'' gel (Mirvaso) and oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream (RHOFADE) applied once a day can produce a prolonged period of blanching of previously red skin in rosacea patients.' "
What oral antibiotics treat rosacea?,"'Physicians commonly prescribe oral antibiotics to patients with moderate rosacea. ''Tetracycline'' (Sumycin), ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox''), and ''minocycline'' (''Dynacin'', ''Minocin''), are oral antibiotics commonly prescribed are presumed to work by reducing inflammation. A newer low-dose doxycycline preparation called Oracea (40 mg once a day) treats rosacea. The dose may be initially high and then be tapered to maintenance levels. Patients should consider common side effects and potential risks before taking oral antibiotics.''Miscellaneous medications''In occasional cases, patients may use short-term topical cortisone (steroid) preparations of minimal strength to reduce local inflammation. Some mild steroids include desonide lotion or hydrocortisone 1% cream applied sparingly once or twice a day just to the irritated areas. There is a risk of causing a rosacea flare by using topical steroids. Prolonged use of topical steroids on the face can also cause irritated skin around the mouth (perioral ''dermatitis'').''Some doctors may also suggest\xa0''tretinoin'' (Retin-A), ''tazarotene'' (''Tazorac''), or ''adapalene'' (''Differin''), which are medications also used for acne. Rarely, physicians prescribe permethrin (''Elimite'') cream for rosacea cases that are associated with skin mites. Permethrin also treats follicular ''Demodex'' mites if warranted.''Doctors infrequently prescribe isotretinoin for severe and resistant rosacea. Often physicians prescribe it after multiple other therapies have been tried for some time and have failed. Patients take a daily capsule of istotretinoin for four to six months. Typically, isotretinoin is most commonly used in the treatment of severe, common acne called acne vulgaris. Close physician monitoring and blood testing are necessary whiles on isotretinoin. Generally, at least two forms of ''birth control'' are required for females using this medication, as ''pregnancy'' is absolutely contraindicated while on isotretinoin.''In addition, prescription or over-the-counter sensitive skin cleansers may also provide symptom relief and control. Avoid harsh soaps and lotions. Simple and pure products such as Cetaphil or Purpose gentle skin cleanser may be less irritating. Patients should avoid excessive rubbing or scrubbing the face.''Other recommended cleansers include' sulfa-based washes (for example, Rosanil) and benzoyl peroxide washes (for example, Clearasil)."
What are other treatments for rosacea?,"'Many patients are now turning to laser and intense light treatments to treat the continual redness and noticeable blood vessels on the face, neck, and chest. Often considered a safe alternative, laser and intense pulse-light therapy may help improve the skin and complexion.''Laser treatment may cause some discomfort. While most patients are able to endure the procedure, ice packs and topical anesthetic cream can help alleviate the discomfort. Multiple treatments are typically necessary, and most insurances do not cover the procedure. Doctors recommend treatments in three- to six-week intervals; during this time, sun avoidance is necessary. Review risk, benefits, and alternatives with a physician prior to treatment. Combine laser treatments with photodynamic therapy (light-activated chemical using Levulan) for more noticeable results.''Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the newly available treatments. PDT uses a topical photosensitizer liquid that one applies to the skin and a light to activate the sensitizer. Levulan (aminolevulinic acid) and blue light, commonly used to treat pre-''cancers'' (''actinic keratosis'"") and acne vulgaris, can treat some rosacea patients. The use of PDT in rosacea is off-label, since it is primarily designed for regular acne. PDT works at reducing the inflammation; PDT is performed in a physician's office. The treatment takes anywhere from one to one and a half hours to complete. Strict sun avoidance for approximately one to three days is required after the treatment. Mild discomfort during the treatment and a mild to moderate sunburn appearance after the treatment is common. Some patients have experienced remissions (disease-free periods) of several months to years from these types of treatments. Other patients may not notice significant improvement.""'Glycolic-acid peels may additionally help improve and control rosacea in some people. Professionals can apply chemical peels to patients for approximately two to five minutes every two to four weeks. Mild stinging, ''itching'', or burning may occur and some patients experience peeling for several days after the peel. Any peel can irritate very sensitive skin and cause flares for some people. Peels should be used with caution in rosacea as not everyone is able to tolerate these treatments.''Sun exposure is a well-known flare for many rosacea sufferers. ''Sun protection'' using a wide-brimmed hat (at least 6 inches) and physical sunscreens (like zinc or titanium) are generally encouraged. Because rosacea tends to occur in mostly fair-skinned adults, physicians recommend the use of an appropriate daily ''SPF'' 50 ''sunscreen'' lotion, along with overall sun avoidance.' "
What are rosacea triggers? Is there a rosacea diet? What foods are good for rosacea?,"'While not all rosacea people are the same, there are some common rosacea triggers. Avoiding these potential triggers may also help relieve symptoms and disease flares. It may be helpful to keep a personal diary of foods and other triggers that flare rosacea symptoms.''Smoking, spicy foods, hot ''drinks'', and alcohol may cause flushing and should be avoided. Exposure to sunlight and to extreme hot and ''cold'' temperatures should be limited as much as possible. Red wine and ''chocolate'"" are two well-known rosacea triggers. Some listed foods may have no effect on one patient's rosacea but severely affect someone else. Individual reaction patterns vary greatly in rosacea. Therefore, a food diary may help to elucidate one's special triggers.""'Possible rosacea dietary triggers include''Avoid potent cortisone or steroid medications on the face because they can promote widening of the tiny blood vessels of the face (telangiectasis). Some patients experience severe rosacea flares after prolonged use of topical steroids.''Vasodilator pills can also flare rosacea. ''Vasodilators'' include certain ''blood pressure'' medications like ''nitrates'', ''calcium channel blockers'' (such as ''nifedipine'' [''Procardia'']), and ''thiazide diuretics'' (such as Dyazide).''Many skin cleansers contain these potential triggers and should be avoided in rosacea.''Foods that decrease rosacea flares include less spicy meals, nonalcoholic cool ''beverages'', ''caffeine''-free drinks, nondairy cheese, and thermally cooler meals.'   dairy, including yogurt, sour cream, cheese (except cottage cheese); alcohol, including red wine, beer, vodka, gin, bourbon, and champagne; chocolate; soy sauce; yeast extract; eggplants, avocados, spinach; some beans and pods, including lima, navy or peas; citrus fruits, including tomatoes, bananas, red plums, raisins, or figs; and spicy and temperature hot foods.

What natural rosacea treatments or home remedies can help?,"'Rosacea skin tends to be sensitive and may easily flare with self-treatment or common acne therapies. Approach any home treatment or attempts for natural remedies with some caution. As with any rosacea therapy, some people may experience sensitivity or irritation with treatment. Several possible natural remedies, including dilute vinegar cleansing and ''green tea'' applications, may be useful in rosacea.''Dilute white vinegar facial soaks or cleansing daily or weekly using approximately 1 part regular table vinegar to 6 parts water may be helpful. Vinegar helps as a natural disinfectant and can help decrease the number of yeasts and bacteria on the skin. Since vinegar may flare rosacea in some people, try a small test area before applying to the entire face.''Green tea soaks to the face may also help decrease the redness and inflammation seen in rosacea. Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties. A few commercially available products also use green tea as the active ingredient.'  "
What is the prognosis for rosacea?,"'Rosacea is an incurable chronic condition. While there is no cure for rosacea, it can be controlled with proper, regular treatment.''There are some forms of rosacea that may be significantly cleared for long periods using laser, intense pulse light, photodynamic therapy, or isotretinoin (Accutane). Although still not considered a ""cure,"" some patients experience long-lasting results and may have remissions (disease-free period of time) for months to years.' "
How should people with rosacea care for their facial skin?,"'Proper ''skin care'' involves using a gentle cleanser to wash the face twice a day. Over-washing may cause irritation. A sunscreen lotion is advisable each morning. A physician may prescribe a topical antibiotic to use once or twice a day under sunscreen.''Rubbing the face tends to irritate the reddened skin. Some cosmetics and hair sprays may also aggravate redness and swelling.''Facial skin care products such as soap, moisturizers, and sunscreens should be free of alcohol or other irritating ingredients. Apply moisturizers very gently after any topical medication has dried. When going outdoors, use sunscreens with an SPF of 50.'  "
What are treatment options for telangiectasias (the red lines)?,"'Telangiectasias are the small blood vessels that arise on the surface of the skin, commonly on around the nose, cheeks, and chin.''Patients can use simple cover-up ''makeup''\xa0for the telangiectasias. There are some green-based moisturizers or tinted foundations that may help conceal the redness.''Doctors can treat telangiectasias with a small electric needle, a laser, intense pulsed light, or minor surgery to close off the dilated blood vessels. Usually, multiple treatments are required for best results, and only a portion of the blood vessels improve with each treatment. Not everyone responds the same to these types of treatments, and a physician can help someone decide which treatment is best for his or her skin type, condition, and size of blood vessels.' Electrocautery Laser Intense pulsed light therapy"
What are treatment options for rhinophyma (the W.C. Fields nose)?,"'Surgery frequently treats rhinophyma of the nose. A physician uses a scalpel, laser, or electro surgery to remove the excess tissue. ''Dermabrasion'' can help improve the look of the ''scar tissue''. Follow-up treatments with laser or intense pulsed light may help lessen the redness. Medical maintenance therapy with oral and or topical antibiotics may be useful to decrease the chance of recurrence.' "
What effect may rosacea have on a person's life?,"""Rosacea may affect someone's life minimally, moderately, or severely depending on how active the condition is and one's overall tolerance of the skin symptoms and signs.""""Some individuals have absolutely no symptoms, and rosacea doesn't bother them. They may enjoy perfectly healthy normal lives without any effect from this benign skin condition. Some patients really like the pink glow to their cheeks and find it gives them a pleasant color without having to use blush. They may not even know they have rosacea. They usually do not want to use any treatment.""""Patients with moderate rosacea may have periodic flares that require treatment with oral antibiotics, lasers, and other therapies. They may require oral antibiotic therapy for years. Some patients complain of looking like they have been drinking alcohol when in fact they don't drink at all. Although rosacea is not a grave medical situation, severe cases may damage some patient's lives. It is important for these patients to express their concerns with their physician and to get professional help in treating their rosacea.""'Overall, promptly diagnosed and properly treated, rosacea should not prevent people with the condition from enjoying long and productive lives.'

Types of lipodystrophy,"'There are many different types of lipodystrophy. It can be acquired, or genetic (inherited). The inherited form may be present at birth or develop during childhood (congenital). It may result in fat loss in only one area of the body or throughout the body (generalized).' Generalized lipodystrophy refers to the situation in which the fat tissue throughout the body is affected (sometimes mistaken for weight or fat gain). Partial, or localized, lipodystrophy affects only one area of the body and is not associated with abnormal health generally. Both generalized lipodystrophy and partial lipodystrophy can be acquired or congenital."
What is generalized lipodystrophy?,"'Lipodystrophy is a term that refers to abnormalities of the fat (adipose) tissue in the body. It is a group of rare conditions that are characterized by progressive loss or redistribution of fat, mainly from the tissues beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissues), but loss of fat surrounding the internal organs (visceral fat) also is possible.' "
What is inherited (familial) lipodystrophy?,"'Inherited lipodystrophy results from a genetic cause.' Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL, the Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There also are several types of the familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), such as FPLD type 1 (Kobberling's syndrome), FPLD type 2 (Dunnigan's syndrome), and other rare types of the disease."
What is acquired lipodystrophy?,"'Acquired lipodystrophy'' is a form of the syndrome that is not genetic, but develops as a response to another condition. The acquired forms include:' Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome) is a disorder that leads to loss of fat in the upper trunk and face, which begins in childhood or adolescence. Lipodystrophy induced by protease inhibitors used in HIV infection treatment; this can involve both fat loss and abnormal fat buildup for the patient with HIV. Localized, or partial, lipodystrophy, such as at an injection site (for example, from cortisone injection), which typically does not affect the overall health of the patient."
What are the signs and symptoms of the types of lipodystrophy?,"'The characteristic symptom of lipodystrophy is the loss of or abnormal distribution of fat. Loss of fat also is referred to as ''lipoatophy'"". In the congenital (inherited) form, the loss of fat causes an abnormal appearance that's usually noticed within the first two years of life. Depending upon the exact cause, the abnormalities may be seen all over the body or localized to one area. For example, some individuals may have areas on their body that appear thin, while other areas might appear larger (where the excessive fat is located). Others might have very little fat on the lower areas of the body and excess fat on the upper areas. Some people will have reduced fat all over the body.""'Children with the condition may have other associated symptoms and signs, for example, the child may:''In generalized lipodystrophy, fat can be found in abnormal locations in the body including the ''heart'', kidneys, ''liver'', and pancreas. The presence of fat deposits in these organs can cause problems such as:''Acquired generalized lipodystrophy has signs and symptoms similar to the inherited forms, but occurs in previously healthy children or adults. In all forms of lipodystrophy, women appear to be more severely affected than men.'  Want and devours food (has a voracious appetite) Grow faster and is taller than his or her piers (accelerated linear growth) Have an increased metabolic rate Have advanced bone age Have a belly that sticks out (protrudes) Have highly developed muscles (prominent musculature) Go through puberty early (precocious sexual development) Have mental retardation Have dark, velvety skin patches (acanthosis nigricans) Insulin resistance Diabetes High cholesterol Fatty liver disease Pancreatitis Heart disease"
What causes lipodystrophy?,"'Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is a result of specific genetic mutations that are passed from one generation to the next (inherited). Mutations in the genes known as AGPAT2 and BSCL2 account for the majority (about 95%) of cases of CGL. Mutations in other genes, including CAV1 and PTRF, have also been associated with this form of the disease.'""Leptin is a natural chemical that is responsible for the metabolism of fat. Some patients  with generalized lipodystrophy have been shown to be deficient in a substance known as leptin. Low leptin levels cause abnormalities in the body's metabolism, which creates excess fat. This excessive fat tissue, as mentioned previously, can cause metabolic complications and diseases like ""'insulin'' resistance, ''diabetes'', ''high cholesterol'', ''fatty liver disease'', and ''heart disease''.''Acquired lipodystrophy'' syndrome has been reported after infections; diseases in which your immune system attacks your body (autoimmune disease); injury (''trauma''); or if pressure is put on, or repeated injections placed in same place on your body (for example, if you have ''diabetes'"" and you give yourself insulin shots on the same place on your skin every day, you might get it at the injection site). Sometimes, doctors and clinicians don't know what caused the trigger event.""'Medical treatment with antiretroviral ''drugs'', for example protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) for HIV infection has been found to cause lipodystrophy in patients infected with the HIV virus.' "
Are there tests to diagnose lipodystrophy?,"'To make the medical diagnosis of lipodystrophy the doctor will first examine the abnormal appearance caused by changes in fat loss or gain, and then he or she will look for the characteristic clinical symptoms and signs.''Blood tests to measure leptin levels as well as to confirm the presence of other metabolic problems (like insulin resistance, diabetes, or elevated blood ''lipid'' levels) are other important diagnostic tests, but not all patients with lipodystrophy have low levels of leptin.''Genetic testing may be performed to evaluate whether a genetic mutation is present in a patient that causes the inherited form.' "
How are the different types of lipodystrophy treated and managed?,"  Generalized lipodystrophy: In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called metreleptin for injection (Myalept) as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency. Metreleptin is used in addition to dietary changes for patients with the congenital generalized or acquired generalized type. Metreleptin is given by injection and is an analog of human leptin produced by recombinant DNA technology. T-cell lymphoma has occurred in patients with the acquired type who had immunodeficiency before beginning metreleptin treatment. Common side effects of metreleptin can include:FatigueHypoglycemiaHeadacheDecreased weightAbdominal pain Fatigue Hypoglycemia Headache Decreased weight Abdominal pain Diet and lipodystrophy: There is no diet plan or therapy that reverses the symptoms of lipodystrophy, but a low-fat diet is recommended for people with the disorder. Treatment of associated diseases: Medical treatment of any associated metabolic abnormalities, including diabetes or high blood cholesterol, is the same as for other patients with these health problems. These treatments include both lifestyle modifications and medications. Acquired lipodystrophy: Your doctor will tailor your treatment based upon the specific cause. For example, if you give yourself insulin shots don't use the same location on the skin every time. Treatment for HIV patients: There are several treatments described for HIV-associated lipodystrophy. HIV treatment options include thiazolidinedione drugs (such as pioglitazone [Actos]), growth hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, metformin (Glucophage), and recombinant human leptin. Surgery: Surgical treatments have also been used to improve the cosmetic appearance in some people."
How common is lipodystrophy?,"'In general, lipodystrophy syndromes are rare.' Generalized lipodystrophy (whether inherited or acquired) is estimated to affect less than one out of every one million people. Approximately 250 cases of acquired partial lipodystrophy have been reported. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is more common, but it is difficult to estimate how common it actually is. Estimates of lipodystrophy associated with HIV have ranged from 10% to over 80% of patients infected with HIV."
What is the prognosis and lifespan for a person with lipodystrophy?,"""It is difficult to estimate the health prognosis for a given person with lipodystrophy because there are many different kinds of the disorder. Moreover, the health of people is affected to varying degrees. Prognosis or outcome on the patient health will be dependent upon the severity of the disorder as well as the extent of associated problems, such as diabetes, HIV, or other diseases and health problems.

What does AIDS stand for? What causes AIDS?,"'AIDS is an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."" The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (HIV) causes AIDS and represents the most advanced stage of HIV infection.''HIV spreads through\xa0infected blood or fluids such as sexual secretions. Over time, the virus attacks the immune system, focusing on special cells called ""CD4 cells"" which are important in protecting the body from infections and ''cancers'', and the number of these cells starts to fall. Eventually, the CD4 cells fall to a critical level and/or the immune system weakens so much that it can no longer fight off certain types of infections and ''cancers''. AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection.''HIV is a very small virus that contains ribonucleic acid (RNA) as its genetic material. When HIV infects animal cells, it uses a special enzyme, reverse transcriptase, to turn (transcribe) its RNA into DNA. (""Retroviruses"" are ''viruses'' that use reverse transcriptase.) When HIV reproduces, it is prone to making small genetic mistakes or mutations, resulting in ''viruses'"" that vary slightly from each other. This ability to create minor variations allows HIV to evade the body's immunologic defenses, essentially leading to lifelong infection, and has made it difficult to make an effective ""'vaccine''. The mutations also allow HIV to become resistant to antiretroviral medications.' "
What is the history of AIDS?,"'Careful investigation has helped scientists determine where HIV came from. Studies have shown that HIV first arose in Africa. It spread from non-human primates to people early in the 20th century, possibly when humans came into contact with infected blood during a chimpanzee hunt. By testing stored blood samples, scientists have found direct evidence of a human being infected as long ago as 1959.''Once introduced into humans, HIV spread through sexual intercourse from person to person. As infected people moved around, the virus spread from Africa to other areas of the world. In 1981, U.S. physicians noticed that a large number of young men were dying of unusual infections and cancers. Initially, U.S. victims were gay men predominately, probably because the virus inadvertently entered this population first in this country and because the virus is transmitted easily during anal intercourse. However, it is important to note that heterosexual activity and contact with infected blood or secretions also efficiently transmits the virus. In Africa, which remains the center of the AIDS pandemic, most cases are heterosexually transmitted. In 1991, the news that Magic Johnson had acquired HIV heterosexually helped the country realize that the infection was not limited to men who had sex with men. Currently in the U.S., approximately 27% of new HIV infections are a result of heterosexual transmission.''Other major factors in the early days of AIDS was transmission from blood by injection ''drug use'' (IDU) with needle sharing and transfusions of blood and blood components. Before the ability to test for the virus in donated blood became available, transfusions infected numerous hemophiliacs and surgical patients.''In the years since people first identified the virus, HIV has spread to every corner of the globe and is one of the leading causes of infectious death worldwide. Statistics from the World Health Organization show that approximately 1.5 million people die each year from AIDS, and 240,000 of these are children. Worldwide, half of HIV-infected people are women. Two-thirds of current cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.''In the U.S., more than 1 million people have HIV infections, and approximately 40,000 are newly infected each year. Over the years, more than 600,000 people in the U.S. have died from AIDS, many of them during what should have been their most productive years of life.' "
What are AIDS symptoms and signs?,"'AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection. People with AIDS often develop symptoms and signs of unusual infections or cancers largely due to the destruction of the CD4 cells in the immune system. When a person with HIV infection gets one of these infections or cancers, medical professionals refer to this as an ""AIDS-defining condition."" Examples of AIDS-defining conditions appear in Table 1. Significant, unexplained ''weight loss'' also is an AIDS-defining condition. Because common conditions like ''cancer'' or other viral conditions like ''infectious mononucleosis'' also can cause ''weight loss'' and ''fatigue'', it is sometimes easy for a physician to overlook the possibility of ''HIV/AIDS''. It is possible for people without AIDS to get some of these conditions, especially the more common infections like ''tuberculosis''.''People with AIDS may develop ''symptoms of pneumonia'' due to ''Pneumocystis jiroveci'', which rarely appears in people with normal immune systems. They also are more likely to get ''pneumonia'' due to common bacteria. Globally, ''tuberculosis'' is one of the most common infections associated with AIDS. In addition, people with AIDS may develop ''seizures'', ''weakness'', or mental changes due to ''toxoplasmosis'', a parasite that infects the brain. Neurological signs also may be due to ''meningitis'' caused by the fungus ''Cryptococcus''. A ''yeast infection'' of the ''esophagus'' called ''candidiasis'' may cause complaints of painful swallowing. Because these infections take advantage of the weakened immune system, health care providers refer to them as ""opportunistic infections.""'""The weakening of the immune system associated with HIV infection can lead to unusual cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma develops as raised patches on the skin that are red, brown, or purple. Kaposi's sarcoma can also be present in the mouth, intestine, or respiratory tract. AIDS also may be associated with ""'lymphoma'' (a type of ''cancer'' involving white blood cells).''In people with AIDS, HIV itself may cause symptoms. Some people experience relentless ''fatigue'' and ''weight loss'', known as ""wasting syndrome."" Others may develop ''confusion'' or sleepiness due to infection of the brain with HIV, known as HIV ''encephalopathy''. Both wasting syndrome and HIV ''encephalopathy'' are AIDS-defining illnesses.' "
What are risk factors for developing AIDS?,"'Developing AIDS requires that the person acquire HIV infection. Risks for acquiring HIV infection include behaviors that result in contact with infected blood or sexual secretions, which pose the main risk of HIV transmission. These behaviors include sexual intercourse and injection ''drug use''. The presence of sores in the genital area, like those caused by ''herpes'', makes it easier for the virus to pass from person to person during intercourse. HIV also has been spread to health care workers through accidental sticks with needles contaminated with blood from HIV-infected people, or when broken skin contacted infected blood or secretions. Blood products used for transfusions or injections also may spread infection, although this has become extremely rare (less than one in 2 million transfusions in the U.S.) due to testing of blood donors and blood supplies for HIV. Finally, infants may acquire HIV from an infected mother either while they are in the womb, during birth, or by ''breastfeeding'' after birth.''The risk that HIV infection will progress to AIDS increases with the number of years since a person acquired the infection. If the HIV infection is untreated, 50% of people will develop AIDS within 10 years, but some people progress in the first year or two and others remain completely asymptomatic with normal immune systems for decades after infection. The risk of developing one of the complications that define AIDS is associated with declining CD4 cells, particularly to below 200 cells/ul.''Antiretroviral treatment substantially reduces the risk that HIV will progress to AIDS. In developed countries, use of ART has turned HIV into a chronic disease that may never progress to AIDS. Conversely, if infected people are not able to take their medications or have a virus that has developed resistance to several medications, they are at increased risk for progression to AIDS.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose AIDS?,"'To diagnose AIDS, the doctor will need (1) a confirmed, positive test for HIV (""HIV positive"" test) and (2) evidence of an AIDS-defining condition or severely depleted CD4 cells.''Testing for HIV is a two-step process involving a screening test and a confirmatory test. Current guidelines recommend that the first step is a screening test that looks for a component of the virus, called p24 antigen, as well as antibodies against HIV. Specimens for testing come from blood obtained from a vein or a ''finger stick'', an oral swab, or a urine sample. Results can come back in minutes (rapid tests) or can take several days, depending on the method that is used. If the screening ''HIV test'' is positive, a different test that looks for antibodies to either HIV-1, the most common form of this virus, or to HIV-2, a strain more common in select parts of the World, such as Western Africa, will confirm the results. If one of these tests is positive, it confirms infection with that particular type of HIV. If both tests are negative, then medical professionals perform a test looking for the virus to see if the initial screening assay detected the viral protein at a time when infection was new and antibodies had yet to develop.''Merely having HIV does not mean a person has AIDS. AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection and requires that the person have evidence of a damaged immune system. That evidence comes from at least one of the following:''It is important to remember, however, that any diagnosis of AIDS requires a confirmed, positive test for HIV.' The presence of an AIDS-defining condition Measuring the CD4 cells in the body and showing that there are fewer than 200 cells per milliliter of blood A laboratory result showing that fewer than 14% of lymphocytes are CD4 cells"
What is the treatment for HIV/AIDS?,"'Antiretroviral medications are medications that fight HIV. Different antiretroviral medications target the virus in different ways. When used in combination with each other, they are very effective at suppressing the virus. It is important to note that there is no cure for HIV. ART only suppresses reproduction of the virus and stops or delays the disease from progressing to AIDS. Most guidelines currently recommend that all HIV-infected people who are willing to take medications should have them initiated shortly after their HIV diagnosis. This delays or prevents disease progression, improves overall health of an infected person, and makes it less likely that they will transmit the virus to their partners.''There are currently seven major classes of antiretroviral medications: (1) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), (2) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), (3) ''protease inhibitors'' (''PIs''), (4) fusion inhibitors, (5) integrase inhibitors, (6) CCR5 antagonists, and (7) entry inhibitor. People use these ''drugs'' in different combinations according to their needs and depending on whether the virus has become resistant to a specific drug or class of ''drugs''. Treatment regimens usually consist of three to four medications at the same time. Combination treatment is essential because using only one class of medication by itself allows the virus to become resistant to the medication. There are now pills that contain multiple drugs in a single pill, making it possible to treat many people with a single pill per day.''Before starting ART, medical professionals usually perform blood tests to make sure the virus is not already resistant to the chosen medications. Health care providers may repeat these resistance tests if it appears the drug regimen is not working or stops working. Physicians instruct patients about the importance of taking all of their medications as directed and are told what side effects to watch for. Noncompliance with medications is the most common cause of treatment failure and can cause the virus to develop resistance to the medication. Because successful therapy often depends on taking several pills, it is important for the patient to understand that this is an ""all or nothing"" regimen. If the person cannot tolerate one of the pills, then he or she should call their physician, ideally prior to stopping any medication. Taking just one or two of the recommended medications is strongly discouraged because it allows the virus to mutate and become resistant. It is best to inform the HIV health care provider immediately about any problems so they can prescribe a better-tolerated combination.' "
What is the treatment for HIV during pregnancy?,"'There are two goals of treatment for ''pregnant'' women with HIV infection: to treat maternal infection and to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. Women can pass HIV to their ''babies'' during ''pregnancy'', during delivery, or after delivery by ''breastfeeding''. Without treatment of the mother and without breastfeeding, the risk of transmission to the baby is about 25%. With treatment of the mother before and during birth and with treatment of the baby after birth, the risk decreases to less than 2%. Because of this benefit, doctors recommended that all ''pregnant'' women undergo routine ''HIV testing'' as part of their ''prenatal care''. Once diagnosed, there are several options for treatment, although woman cannot use some antiretroviral medications during ''pregnancy'' and others have not been studied in pregnancy. For example, recent data suggests that dolutegravir (Tivicay) should be avoided in women who may become pregnant so that exposure at ''conception'' does not occur. Fortunately, there are treatment regimens that have been shown to be well tolerated by most pregnant women, significantly improving the outcome for mother and child. The same principles of testing for ''drug resistance'' and combining antiretrovirals used for nonpregnant patients are used for pregnant patients. All pregnant women with HIV should receive ART treatment regardless of their CD4 cell count, although the choice of drugs may differ slightly from nonpregnant women. In developed countries, women also are instructed not to breastfeed their children.''Compliance with medications is important to provide the best outcome for mother and child. Even though a physician might highly recommend a medication regimen, the pregnant woman has a choice of whether or not to take the medicines. Studies have shown improved compliance when there is good communication between the woman and her doctor, with open discussions about the benefits and side effects of treatment. Compliance also improves with better social support, including friends and relatives.''Patients must continue medications throughout pregnancy, ''labor'', and delivery. Some medicines, such as ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT), can be given intravenously during ''labor'', particularly for those women who do not have good viral suppression at the time of delivery. Patients need to continue other medications orally during ''labor'"" to try to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby during delivery. If the quantity of virus in the mother's blood (viral load) is more than 1,000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, doctors will perform a scheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus during vaginal delivery. Women with HIV should continue taking ART after delivery for their own health.""'If a pregnant woman with HIV infection does not take ART during pregnancy and goes into ''labor'', medical professionals will still give her medications during ''labor''. This reduces the risk of transmission of HIV. After delivery, health care providers will give the infant medication(s) for at least six weeks to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV. If the mother did not take ART during pregnancy or if the mother has a drug-resistant virus, medical professionals will treat infants with multiple medications. Health care providers test infants periodically in the first six months to ensure they have not acquired the virus.' "
What is the treatment for non-HIV-infected people exposed to the genital secretions or blood of someone with HIV?,"'Blood and genital secretions from people with HIV are infectious and the utmost care should be taken in handling them. Fluids contaminated with blood also are potentially infectious. Feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomit are not considered infectious unless visibly bloody.''The most commonly reported occupational exposures are''The average risk of HIV infection after a needle-stick injury is around 0.3% and after mucous-membrane exposure to blood is approximately 0.09%. For abraded skin exposure, the risk is less than mucous membrane exposure. Some factors that may affect the risk for HIV transmission such as the amount of blood from the infected source. Deep injury from a needle, visible blood in/on the needle, or a needle placed in an artery or vein are examples of higher-risk situations. The risk of transmission also depends on the number of virus particles in the blood, with higher viral loads leading to an increased risk of transmission.''If an exposure occurs, the exposed person can reduce the risk of getting HIV by taking antiretroviral medications. Current recommendations suggest three antiretroviral medications. Start medications as soon as possible, preferably within hours of exposure and should be continued for four weeks, if tolerated. People who have been exposed should be tested for HIV at the time of the injury and again at six weeks, 12 weeks, and six months after exposure.''It is important to document that an exposure has occurred or was likely. A needle stick from a person with HIV or a person likely to have HIV constitutes a significant exposure. Medications should be started immediately. If it is unknown whether the person who is the source of the potentially infected material has HIV, health care providers can test the source person. Medications started immediately in the exposed person can be discontinued if the source person does not turn out to carry HIV. Potentially infectious material splashed in the eye or mouth, or encountering non-intact skin, also constitutes an exposure and should prompt immediate evaluation to determine if medications should be started.''Other potential exposures include vaginal and anal sexual intercourse and sharing needles during intravenous drug use. There is less evidence for the role of antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after these exposures. In part, this is because the exposed person usually does not know the HIV status of a sexual partner or drug user. Nevertheless, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends treatment for people exposed through sexual activity or injectable drug use to someone who is known to carry HIV. If the HIV status of the source is not known, the decision to treat is individualized. Concerned people should see their physician for advice. If a decision to treat is made, medications should be started within 72 hours of the exposure.''For every exposure, especially with blood, it is important to test for other blood-borne diseases like ''hepatitis B'' or C, which are more common among HIV-infected patients. Reporting to a supervisor, in the case of health care workers, or seeking immediate medical consultation is advisable. For sexual exposures, medical professionals should test patients for ''syphilis'', ''gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'', and other ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') because individuals with HIV are more likely to have other ''STDs''. Patients also should be counseled about how to prevent exposure in the future.' an inadvertent needle stick (usually when drawing blood from someone with HIV); a cut from a sharp object such as a scalpel that is contaminated with blood; exposure of mucous membranes to infectious fluid (mucous membranes that may be exposed to splashes of material include the mouth, nasal passages, and eyes); exposure of open sores or abraded/inflamed skin to infectious material."
What are the complications of HIV?,"'The complications of HIV infection result mainly from a weakened immune system. The virus also infects the brain, causing degeneration, problems with thinking, or even ''dementia''. This makes the person more vulnerable to certain types of conditions and infections (see Table 1). Treatment with ART can prevent, reverse, or mitigate the effects of HIV infection. Some patients on ART may be at risk for developing ''cholesterol'' or blood-''sugar'' problems.''Although many effective medications are on the market, the virus can become resistant to any drug. This can be a serious complication if it means that a patient must use a less effective medicine. To reduce the risk of resistance, patients should take their medications as prescribed and call their physician immediately if they feel they need to stop one or more drugs.' "
What is the prognosis for HIV infection?,"'Left untreated, HIV is usually a fatal illness with half of people dying within nine months of diagnosis of an AIDS-defining condition. The use of ART has dramatically changed this grim picture. People who are on an effective ART regimen have life expectancies that are similar to or only moderately less than the uninfected population. Unfortunately, many people with HIV deal with socioeconomic issues, substance-abuse issues, or other problems that interfere with their ability or desire to take medications.' "
How can people prevent an HIV infection?,"'Sexual abstinence is completely effective in eliminating sexual transmission, but educational campaigns have not been successful in promoting abstinence in at-risk populations. Monogamous sexual intercourse between two uninfected partners also eliminates sexual transmission of the virus. Using barrier methods, such as ''condoms'', during sexual intercourse markedly reduces the risk of HIV transmission. These measures have had some success in blunting the rate of new cases, especially in high-risk areas such as sub-Saharan Africa or Haiti. As discussed above, medications may reduce the risk of HIV infection if used within hours of an exposure. There also is data that if uninfected people can take antiretroviral medications, in particular ''tenofovir'' disoproxil fumarate plus ''emtricitabine'' (TDF/FTC or ''Truvada'') once daily, that it markedly reduces the risk of sexual transmission. Perhaps the most effective way to reduce HIV transmission is for the HIV-infected partner to be on ART with undetectable levels of virus in their blood. As noted above, a pregnant woman with HIV can reduce the risk of passing the infection to her baby by taking medications during pregnancy and ''labor'' and avoiding breastfeeding. There is now growing data that those consistently suppressed on ART pose virtually no risk of transmitting sexually to their partners.''People can prevent needle-stick injuries by touching syringes with only one hand and by using more modern needles that have retractable sleeves. Use of gowns, gloves, masks, and eye protection can reduce the risk of exposure to infected secretions in high-risk settings. For intravenous-drug abusers, use of clean needles and elimination of needle sharing reduces the risk of transmission.' "
Is there a vaccine for HIV?,"'To date, there is no effective vaccine for HIV. Researchers have made several attempts to create a vaccine but all have failed. This remains an active area of research.' "
What are researchers doing to find a cure for HIV?,"""The search for a cure for HIV began as soon as researchers identified the virus. HIV is probably one of the most studied viruses in history. Scientists have a detailed knowledge of the virus' genes, proteins, and understand how it functions. In fact, researchers chose the combinations of drugs that make up ART therapy because they attack different parts of the virus life cycle, causing it to malfunction. However, ART is not a cure and HIV patients must take the drugs for life. Even when viral levels are low, the virus is still present in the body.""'One of the problems with finding a cure is that the virus can persist in cells throughout the body and potentially hide in areas that are difficult for drugs to reach, like the brain. New research is helping us understand how to treat viruses effectively in these secluded areas of the body. In addition, researchers are studying those infected cells that persist in the body to determine how they can be stimulated to produce virus and/or be targeted for clearance from the body by novel therapies.' "
Where can a person find information about clinical trials for HIV and AIDS?,'There are a large number of studies currently under way that involve HIV-infected patients. These studies are registered in a central database that can be searched at ''http://clinicaltrials.gov''.' 
What is a skin tag?,"'Skin tags are common, acquired benign skin-colored growths that resemble a small, soft balloon suspended on a slender stalk. Skin tags are harmless growths that can vary in number from one to hundreds. Males and females are equally prone to developing skin tags. ''Obesity'' seems to be associated with skin tag development. Although some skin tags may fall off spontaneously, most persist once formed. The medical name for skin tag is ''acrochordon''. Some people call them ""skin tabs.""''Early on, skin tags may be as small as a flattened pinhead-sized bump. While most tags typically are small (2 mm-5 mm in diameter) at approximately one-third to one-half the size of a pencil eraser, some skin tags may become as large as a big grape (1 cm in diameter) or a fig (5 cm in diameter).' "
Is there another medical name for a skin tag?,"'Medical terms your physician or dermatologist may use to describe a skin tag include fibroepithelial polyp, acrochordon, cutaneous papilloma, and soft fibroma. All of these terms describe skin tags and are benign (noncancerous), painless skin growths. Some people refer to these as ""skin tabs"" or ''warts''.' "
What causes skin tags?,'The precise cause of skin tags is unknown.' 
Where do skin tags occur?,"'Skin tags can occur almost anywhere on the body covered by skin. However, the two most common areas for skin tags are the neck and armpits. Other common body areas for the development of skin tags include the eyelids, upper chest (particularly under the female breasts), buttock folds, and groin folds. Tags are typically thought to occur where skin rubs against itself or clothing. ''Babies'' who are plump may also develop skin tags in areas where skin rubs against skin, like the sides of the neck. Younger children may develop tags at the upper ''eyelid'' areas, often in areas where they may rub their eyes. Older children and preteens may develop tags in the underarm area from friction and repetitive skin rubbing from sports.''Skin tags typically occur in the following characteristic locations:'   Base of the neck Underarms Eyelids Groin folds Buttock folds Under the breasts"
Who tends to get skin tags?,"'More than half if not all of the general population has been reported to have skin tags at some time in their lives. Although tags are generally acquired (not present at birth) and may occur in anyone, more often they arise in adulthood. They are much more common in middle age, and they tend to increase in prevalence up to age 60. Children and toddlers may also develop skin tags, particularly in the underarm and neck areas. Skin tags are more common in ''overweight'' people.''Hormone elevations, such as those seen during ''pregnancy'', may cause an increase in the formation of skin tags, as skin tags are more frequent in ''pregnant'' women. Tags are essentially harmless and do not have to be treated unless they are bothersome. Skin tags that are bothersome may be easily removed during or after pregnancy, typically by a dermatologist.''Although skin tags are generally not associated with any other diseases, there seems to be a group of obese individuals who, along with many skin tags, develop a condition called ''acanthosis nigricans'' on the skin of their neck and armpits and are predisposed to have high blood ''fats'' and ''sugar''.''Certain structures resemble skin tags but are not. Accessory tragus and an accessory digit occasionally can be confused with skin tags. Pathological examination with a biopsy of the tissue will help distinguish skin tags if there is any question as to the diagnosis.' "
Will removing a skin tag cause more to grow?,"'There is no evidence that removing a skin tag will cause more tags to grow. There is no expectation of causing skin tags to ""seed"" or spread by removing them. In reality, some people are simply more prone to developing skin tags and may have new growths periodically. Some individuals request periodic removal of tags at annual or even quarterly intervals.' "
Is a skin tag a tumor?,"'Skin tags are a type of harmless skin growth or benign ''tumor''. Tags are generally not cancerous (''malignant'"") and don't become cancerous if left untreated.""'There are extremely rare instances where a skin tag may become ''precancerous'' or cancerous. Skin tag-like ''bumps'' that bleed, grow, or display multiple colors like pink, brown, red, or black can require a biopsy to exclude other causes, including ''skin cancer''.' "
Are skin tags contagious?,'No. There is no evidence to suggest that common skin tags are ''contagious''.' 
What else could it be?,"'While classic skin tags are typically very characteristic in appearance and occur in specific locations such as the underarms, necks, under breasts, eyelids and groin folds, there are tags that may occur in less obvious locations.''Other skin growths that may look similar to a skin tag but are not tags include ''moles'' (dermal ''nevus''), nerve and ''fiber''-type ''moles'' (neurofibromas), ''warts'', and ""barnacles"" or the so-called ""Rice Krispies"" (seborrheic keratoses).''Warts tend to have a ""warty"" irregular surface whereas skin tags are usually smooth. Warts tend to be flat whereas tags are more like bumps hanging from thin stalk. While warts are almost entirely caused by human papilloma virus (''HPV''), tags are rarely associated with ''HPV''.''Groin and genital skin lesions resembling skin tags may actually be ''genital warts'' or condyloma. A biopsy would help diagnose which of these growths are not skin tags. Very rarely, a ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', or ''malignant melanoma'' may mimic a skin tag, but this is very uncommon.' "
Skin tag vs. wart,"'While warts are caused by a virus called ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) and are known to be very contagious, skin tags are not thought to be caused by HPV.' "
What does a skin tag look like under a microscope?,"'Laboratory preparation of the tissue is required before looking at the skin tag under the microscope. The skin is stained with a stain called hematoxylin and eosin (""H&E""). Under the microscope, there is a colored spherical tissue attached to a small stalk. The purple outer layer (''epidermis'') overlies a pink core (dermis).''The outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) shows overgrowth of normal skin (hyperplasia), and it encloses an underlying layer of skin (the dermis) in which the normally present collagen fibers appear abnormally loose and swollen. Usually there are no hairs, moles, or other skin structures present in skin tags.''While the majority of skin tags are simply destroyed, sometimes tissue is sent for microscopic exam by a health care specialist known as a pathologist, who will determine the exact diagnosis and determine whether an abnormality such as ''skin cancer'' is present. Irregular skin growths that are larger, bleed, or have an unusual presentation may require pathology examination to make sure there are no irregular cells or ''skin cancers''.''Some common ''skin conditions'' that can mimic skin tags include seborrheic keratoses, moles, warts, ''cysts'', milia, neurofibromas, and nevus lipomatosus. Rarely, skin ''cancers'' like ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', and malignant ''melanoma'' may mimic skin tags.' "
What signs and symptoms do skin tags cause?,"'Except for the cosmetic appearance, skin tags generally cause no physical ''pain'' or discomfort. These tiny skin growths generally cause symptoms when they are repeatedly irritated (for example, by the collar or in the groin). Cosmetic reasons are the most common reason for skin tag removal. The following symptoms and signs may necessitate skin tag removal:''Sometimes, they may become snagged by clothing, jewelry, pets, or seat belts, causing ''pain'' or discomfort. Overall, these are very benign growths that have no ''cancer'' (malignant) potential.''Occasionally, a tag may spontaneously fall off without any pain or discomfort. This may occur after the tag has twisted on itself at the stalk base, interrupting the blood flow to the tag.'   it has become irritated and red from bleeding (hemorrhage) or black from twisting, and death of the skin tissue (necrosis)."
Does medical insurance cover skin tag removal?,"'Many if not all insurance carriers classify skin tags as cosmetic and therefore a self-pay treatment. In uncommon instances, documented medical necessity of suspicious growths or highly symptomatic growths may support payment for medical treatment of skin tags.' "
Do any creams remove skin tags?,"'There are no currently medically approved creams for the removal of skin tags. Skin tags are typically removed by physical methods like cutting off or tying off with dental floss. It is not advisable to use unapproved products like Dermasil, wart removers, ''tea tree oil'', nail polish, ''toothpaste'', or hair-removal creams like Neet or Nair. Trial uses of unapproved creams may cause irritation and possible secondary complications.'  "
Should I worry about cutting my skin tag by shaving?,"'No. Skin tags are frequently and inadvertently shaved off while removing hair from the armpit either with a razor or by waxing. There is typically no harm done when small skin tags are removed by shaving.''Sometimes, even a small skin tag base may bleed for a while and require constant applied pressure for 10-15 minutes to stop bleeding. ''Skin infection'' is a rare possible complication of accidentally shaving off skin tags.' "
Do skin tags need to be sent for biopsy?,"'Most typical small skin tags may be removed without sending tissue for microscopic examination or biopsy.''However, there are some larger or atypical growths that may be removed and sent to a pathologist for examination under a microscope to make sure that the tissue is really a skin tag and nothing more. Additionally, skin bumps that have bled or rapidly changed may also need pathologic examination.''Some common skin tag look-alikes include benign lesions such as seborrheic keratoses, common moles, warts, neurofibromas, and a fatty mole called nevus lipomatosus. While extremely rare, there are a few reports of skin cancers found in skin tags. Skin cancers like basal cell ''carcinoma'', squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant ''melanoma'' may rarely mimic skin tags, as described above.' "
Are there vaginal skin tags?,"'While typical skin tags are not usually seen in the vagina or in other moist, mucosal surfaces, there are other types of benign polyps that occur in these areas. Irritation polyps or soft fibromas may occur on vaginal areas, mouth, and anal skin. Skin tags most commonly occur on ''dry skin'' like the neck, armpits, and groin folds. ''Genital warts'', which are growths caused by a sexually transmitted virus HPV, need to be considered in the possible diagnosis for growths in genital areas.''Skin tags may infrequently occur at the external genitalia like the labia majora and labia minora. Again, sexually transmitted viral conditions like genital warts may need to be ruled out by tissue biopsy of growths in this area.' "
Can you get skin tags on the penis and scrotum?,"'Skin tags may occur at unusual sites like the penis, scrotum, and opening of the penis tip. Sexually transmitted viral conditions (HPV) like genital warts in the genital area can require a tissue biopsy for diagnosis.' "
What happens when a skin tag suddenly turns purple or black?,"""A thrombosed or clotted skin tag may suddenly change colors, becoming purple, black, and irritated when its blood supply is inadequate. Thrombosed skin tags typically may fall off on their own in 3 to 10 days and don't require additional treatment.""""Skin tags that have changed color or bleed may require your doctor's evaluation and reassurance. Rarely, thrombosed skin tags may be a sign of another condition and need to be biopsied.""  "
What is the prognosis for skin tags?,"'The long-term results after destruction of the individual skin tag are excellent. However, it should be understood that this does not prevent the development of new skin tags.' "
Is it possible to prevent skin tags?,'No. It is not possible to prevent skin tags.' 
Facts you should know about an actinic keratosis," An actinic keratosis is a small, rough spot occurring on sun-exposed skin. Actinic keratoses are also known as a solar keratoses. Actinic keratoses occur most commonly in fair-skinned people after years of sun exposure. Common locations for actinic keratoses are the face, scalp, ears, back of the neck, upper chest, as well as the tops of the hands and forearms. Actinic keratoses are very thin superficial lesions that have not penetrated into the deeper layers of the skin; they are predisposed to become skin cancer however. Doctors can usually diagnose an actinic keratosis simply by physical examination. It is best to prevent actinic keratoses by minimizing sun exposure. Treatments for actinic keratoses include cryosurgery, scraping or burning, 5-fluorouracil cream, imiquimod (Aldara), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR, Cambia), ingenol mebutate (Picato), TCA skin peels, and photodynamic therapy."
"What is an actinic keratosis? 
What causes actinic keratoses?","'An actinic keratosis (AK) is a small, rough spot occurring on skin that develops because of chronic sun exposure. These small superficial spots are superficial ''skin cancers'' that have not invaded the deeper layers of the skin. Actinic keratoses characteristically appear on photo-damaged skin. Actinic keratosis is also referred to as a ''solar keratosis''.''Specialized forms of actinic keratoses include ''cutaneous horns'', in which the skin protrudes in a thick, hornlike manner, and ''actinic cheilitis'', a scaling and roughness of the lower lip and blurring of the border of the lip and adjacent skin. There are other causes of cutaneous horns, including ''warts'' and ''age spots'' (seborrheic keratoses).' "
What are actinic keratosis symptoms and signs?,"'Actinic keratoses generally range in size between 2-6 mm in diameter (between the size of a pencil point and that of an eraser). They are usually reddish in color, with a rough texture and often have a white or yellowish scale on top. There is often a prickling ''pain'' felt when it is touched.'  "
Who is at risk for actinic keratoses?,"'Those who develop actinic keratoses tend to be fair-skinned people who have spent years outdoors at work or play or who have exposed their skin to indoor tanning ''radiation''. Their skin often becomes wrinkled, mottled, and thinned from sun exposure. Others at risk include immunosuppressed organ transplant patients and patients treated with ''PUVA'' therapy (long-wave ultraviolet light plus an oral drug called psoralen) for ''psoriasis''.' "
Where on the body do actinic keratoses typically occur?,"'Common locations for actinic keratoses are the cheeks, ''bridge'' of the nose, rim of the ears, scalp, back of the neck, upper chest, and the tops of the hands and forearms. Men are more likely to develop AKs on top of the ears or on a bald pate, whereas long hair is often protective.'  "
What is the significance of an actinic keratosis?,"'Actinic keratoses localized superficial tumors with the biological potential to develop into invasive ''skin cancer''. Although the chance of an individual actinic keratosis progressing into an invasive ''squamous cell carcinoma'' is less than 1%, patients with many of these lesions (very common) who continue to expose their skin to carcinogenic ultraviolet sunlight are likely to develop invasive skin ''cancers''. Squamous cell skin cancers are locally destructive and have a small but real potential for ''metastasis'' (spreading to other areas). Treating actinic keratoses at an early stage will help prevent invasive ''skin cancer''. When patients are diagnosed with this condition, they often say, ""But I never go out in the sun!"" The explanation for this is that there can be a long delay, even decades, for these keratoses to develop. Short periods of sun exposure do not generally either produce actinic keratoses or transform them into skin cancers.' "
What specialists diagnose actinic keratoses?,"'Generally, primary care physicians or dermatologists can diagnose and care for actinic keratosis. If the lesion is especially large or thick, a biopsy may be advisable to make sure that the spot in question has not become a ''skin cancer''.''There are other spots, called seborrheic keratoses, which are not caused by sun exposure and have no relationship to skin cancers. These are raised brown lesions that may appear on any area of the skin. They also often run in families.'  "
What is the treatment for an actinic keratosis?,"'The best treatment for an AK is ''prevention''. For light-skinned individuals, this means minimizing their sun exposure. By the time actinic keratoses develop, however, the relevant ultraviolet radiation is often so far in the past that prudent preventive measures play a relatively small role. Fortunately, treatment methods are usually simple and straightforward:'   Cryosurgery: Freezing with liquid nitrogen Other forms of surgery: Doctors sometimes scrape away or burn off AKs. Laser resurfacing: Using either carbon dioxide (CO) or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) lasers 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): Creams containing this medication cause AKs to become red and inflamed before they fall off. Although effective, this method often produces unsightly and uncomfortable skin for a period of weeks, thus making it impractical for many patients. This method is best for patients who have a great deal of sun damage and many AKs. Once the skin heals, it often looks much smoother and even-toned. Imiquimod (Aldara): This immune stimulator is similar in its indications and effects to 5-FU. Ingenol mebutate (Picato): Is derived from the sap of a plant of the genus Euphorbia, which is related to the poinsettia plants that are popular at Christmas time. It is helpful in the treatment of small areas, but causes significant irritation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT): This therapy involves applying an agent (aminolevulinic acid [Levulan] or ALA) that sensitizes the skin to light, leaving it on for about one hour, and then exposing the skin to light that activates the chemical. This blue light is absorbed by the compound, releasing the energy as heat which is believed to destroy the actinic keratoses. Like 5-FU and imiquimod, photodynamic therapy works best for patients with many AKs. Patients need to avoid exposure to sun or intense fluorescent light for two days after treatment to prevent ongoing peeling. Diclofenac (Solaraze): This cream is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an agent related to ibuprofen (Advil, Children's Advil/Motrin, Medipren, Motrin, Nuprin, PediaCare Fever), a popular medication for headaches. Diclofenac is gentler than 5-FU or imiquimod, causing less inflammation, but must be applied for a longer period of about two months to achieve only modest improvement. Superficial chemical peels using trichloracetic acid (TCA) can also be effective. This procedure is performed in the doctor's office."
Are there home remedies for actinic keratoses?,"'There are no home remedies for actinic keratoses, but many will resolve spontaneously if sun exposure can be strictly limited. Those lesions that do not resolve need professional medical attention.' "
Is it possible to prevent actinic keratoses?,"'Sun avoidance is the simplest way to avoid actinic keratoses. This would include applications of ''SPF'' 50 sunscreens to exposed skin, wearing sun-protective clothing, shade-seeking behavior, and avoiding tanning. There is now some evidence that taking niacinamide (nicotinamide), not ''niacin'', may have some preventative benefit. Niacinamide is available at many health food stores. Concerns about ''vitamin D deficiency'' can be avoided by taking multivitamin ''supplements''.' "
What is the prognosis of an actinic keratosis?,"'Patients who develop actinic keratoses should be examined at least once yearly. Actinic keratoses are an indicator that sufficient sun exposure has occurred to produce skin cancers such as ''basal cell carcinoma'', ''squamous cell carcinoma'', and ''malignant melanoma''. The purpose of these regular checks is to prevent and detect the development of invasive skin ''cancer''. Furthermore, continual avoidance of excessive sun exposure can decrease the risk of recurrences.' "
How is actinic purpura caused?, 
What are the signs and symptoms of actinic purpura?,"'Macules and patches are lesions seen in actinic purpura that appear dark purple on the skin and are irregularly shaped. Some lesions are darker than others because of their longer duration. There is a sharp demarcation (margin) seen between the borders of the lesions and normal surrounding skin.''Lesions are usually more than 3 mm in diameter and commonly present on the surface of the hands but do not extend onto the fingers. Ecchymoses may also be seen on the face and neck. Other signs of photo-''aging'' (dermatoheliosis) include a mild yellow tinge to the skin, leathered wrinkling, and pseudo ''scars'' (false scarring). The skin may appear darker due to ''hyperpigmentation'' as a result of residual hemosiderosis.' "
How is actinic purpura treated?,"'Treatment of actinic purpura is mainly conservative. Treatment options include:''Patients are advised to try and avoid any risk of injury to the affected areas.' Protection from photodamage: Protective measures against sun damage can prevent or reduce further sun damage and worsening of the condition. Reducing further ultraviolet-induced sun damage involves applying high SPF sunscreens with UV-A and UV-B protection to all exposed areas of the body throughout the year, even if it’s raining or during the winter when it may not seem very sunny. It is also advised to use barrier protection (full-sleeved clothing, covered pants, wide-brimmed hats, etc.) to further reduce the risk of sun damage. Patients with actinic purpura should limit their sun exposure or avoid direct sun exposure altogether. Tretinoin: This has been found to reverse several changes that occur as a result of photodamage. Tretinoin increases the amount of collagen in the dermis when applied to the skin. However, applying tretinoin to the actinic purpura lesions does not improve the lesions. Laser therapy: Anti-aging laser therapy such as Nd: YAG laser can help treat vascular and pigmented lesions in aging and sun-damaged skin."
Can actinic purpura be treated?,"'Actinic purpura can be managed by adhering to lifelong ''sun protection'' measures and starting early such as:' Avoiding sun exposure when the sun is at its strongest, owing to a high risk of sun damage, that is, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Applying sunscreen with UV-A and UV-B protection every day throughout the year Wearing protective clothing while outdoors during the day as a method of barrier protection Carrying an umbrella or wearing a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses during the day"
What is acupuncture?,"'Acupuncture is a component of the health care system of China that can be traced back at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Acupuncture may, it has been theorized, correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin.''The practice of acupuncture to treat identifiable pathophysiological (disease) conditions in American medicine was rare until the visit of President Richard M. Nixon to China in 1972. Since that time, there has been an explosion of interest in the United States and Europe in the application of the technique of acupuncture to Western medicine.''Acupuncture is a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical locations on or in the skin by a variety of techniques. There are a variety of approaches to diagnosis and treatment in American acupuncture that incorporate medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The most thoroughly studied mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin, solid, metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation.'

Are there standards for acupuncture needles?,"'After reviewing the existing body of knowledge, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed acupuncture needles from the category of ""experimental medical devices."" The FDA now regulates acupuncture needles, just as it does other devices such as surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes, under good manufacturing practices and single-use standards of sterility.' "
What are the possible side effects of acupuncture?,"'The most common serious injury reported from the needles of acupuncture has been accidental puncture of the lung, which results in a partial collapse of the lung called ''pneumothorax''.  The most common infection reported from acupuncture treatments is ''viral hepatitis'', a potentially serious infection of the ''liver''.  Other side effects include ''bacterial infections'' locally at the site of needle insertion in the skin and elsewhere in the body. Generally, side effects seem to relate to ''poor hygiene'' and training of the acupuncturist.' "
For what conditions has acupuncture treatment been found helpful?,"'The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program was established in 1977 and is designed to assess health technology.  The program organizes major conferences that produce consensus statements and technology assessment statements on controversial issues in medicine important to health care providers, patients, and the general public. The following statement is from the NIH Consensus Development Statement on Acupuncture on November 3-5, 1997.''Acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention is widely practiced in the United States. There have been many studies of its potential usefulness. However, many of these studies provide equivocal results because of design, sample size, and other factors. The issue is further complicated by inherent difficulties in the use of appropriate controls, such as placebo and sham acupuncture groups.''However, promising results have emerged, for example, efficacy of acupuncture in adult post-operative and chemotherapy ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' and in post-operative dental ''pain''. There are other situations such as ''addiction'', ''stroke'' rehabilitation, ''headache'', ''menstrual cramps'', ''tennis elbow'', ''fibromyalgia'', ''myofascial pain'', ''osteoarthritis'', ''low back pain'', ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', and ''asthma'' where acupuncture may be useful as an adjunct treatment or an acceptable alternative or be included in a comprehensive management program.''Findings from basic research have begun to elucidate the mechanisms of action of acupuncture, including the release of opioids and other peptides in the central nervous system and the periphery and changes in neuroendocrine function. Although much needs to be accomplished, the emergence of plausible mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of acupuncture is encouraging.'""The introduction of acupuncture into the choice of treatment modalities that are readily available to the public is in its early stages. Issues of training, licensure, and reimbursement remain to be clarified. There is sufficient evidence, however, of acupuncture's value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its physiology and clinical value.This statement is representative of the opinions of current standard medical practice.""  "
How does acupuncture work?,"'Here are current thoughts from the National Institutes of Health on the manner by which acupuncture might produce beneficial health results.''Many studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses. These responses can occur locally, i.e., at or close to the site of application, or at a distance, mediated mainly by sensory neurons to many structures within the central nervous system. This can lead to activation of pathways affecting various physiological systems in the brain as well as in the periphery. A focus of attention has been the role of endogenous opioids in acupuncture analgesia. Considerable evidence supports the claim that opioid peptides are released during acupuncture and that the analgesic effects of acupuncture are at least partially explained by their actions. That opioid antagonists such as naloxone reverse the analgesic effects of acupuncture further strengthens this hypothesis. Stimulation by acupuncture may also activate the hypothalamus and the ''pituitary gland'', resulting in a broad spectrum of systemic effects. Alteration in the secretion of neurotransmitters and neurohormones and changes in the regulation of blood flow, both centrally and peripherally, have been documented. There is also evidence that there are alterations in immune functions produced by acupuncture. Which of these and other physiological changes mediate clinical effects is at present unclear.''Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the ""acupuncture points,"" the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial. Even more elusive is the scientific basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of Qi, the meridian system, and other related theories, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture.''Some of the biological effects of acupuncture have also been observed when ""sham"" acupuncture points are stimulated, highlighting the importance of defining appropriate control groups in assessing biological changes purported to be due to acupuncture. Such findings raise questions regarding the specificity of these biological changes. In addition, similar biological alterations including the release of endogenous opioids and changes in ''blood pressure'' have been observed after painful stimuli, vigorous ''exercise'', and/or relaxation training; it is at present unclear to what extent acupuncture shares similar biological mechanisms.''It should be noted also that for any therapeutic intervention, including acupuncture, the so-called ""non-specific"" effects account for a substantial proportion of its effectiveness, and thus should not be casually discounted. Many factors may profoundly determine therapeutic outcome including the quality of the relationship between the clinician and the patient, the degree of trust, the expectations of the patient, the compatibility of the backgrounds and belief systems of the clinician and the patient, as well as a myriad of factors that together define the therapeutic milieu.''Although much remains unknown regarding the mechanism(s) that might mediate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture, it is encouraging that a number of significant acupuncture-related biological changes can be identified and carefully delineated.''Further research in this direction not only is important for elucidating the phenomena associated with acupuncture, but also has the potential for exploring new pathways in human physiology not previously examined in a systematic manner.'

What are causes of bursitis?,"'The three most common causes of bursitis are repetitive motions (for example, repeated throwing of a ball), ''trauma'' (extensive kneeling or hitting your knee on a table), infection, and preexisting rheumatoid conditions.''Trauma causes inflammatory bursitis from repetitive injury or direct impact.''Bursae close to the surface of the skin are the most likely to get infected with bacteria, a condition that is called septic bursitis. The most common bacteria to cause septic bursitis is ''Staphylococcus aureus'' or ''Staphylococcus'' ''epidermis''. People with ''diabetes'', ''alcoholism'', certain kidney conditions, those with suppressed immune systems such as from cortisone medications (steroid treatments), and those with wounds to the skin over a bursa are at higher risk for septic bursitis. About 85% of septic bursitis occurs in men.''People with certain rheumatoid diseases such as ''gout'' and ''pseudogout'' can develop bursitis from crystal deposits. When these crystals form in a bursa, they cause inflammation leading to bursitis.' Chronic bursitis: The most common cause of chronic bursitis is minor trauma that may occur to the shoulder (subdeltoid) bursa from repetitive motion, for example, throwing a baseball. Another example is prepatellar bursitis (in front of the knee) from prolonged or repetitive kneeling on a hard surface to scrub a floor or lay carpet. Acute bursitis: A direct blow (let's say you accidentally bang your knee into a table) can cause blood to leak into the bursa. This causes inflammation with pain as well as swelling."
What are bursitis risk factors?,"'Risk factors for bursitis include repetitive activities, ''gout'', pseudogout, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', trauma, and skin infections.' "
What are bursitis symptoms and signs?,"'Bursitis causes ''pain'' and tenderness around the affected bone or tendon. The bursae sacs may swell, often making movement difficult. The most commonly affected joints are the shoulder, elbow, knee, and foot.''In the shoulder, the subacromial bursa (subdeltoid bursa) separates the supraspinatus tendon from the overlying bone and deltoid muscle. Inflammation of this bursa is usually a result of injury to surrounding structures, most commonly the ''rotator cuff''. This limits the range of motion of the shoulder resulting in an ""''impingement syndrome''."" The condition causes pain in the side or front of the shoulder.''Bursitis of the tip of the elbow, olecranon bursitis, is the most common form of bursitis.''Retrocalcaneal bursitis occurs when the bursa under the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel becomes inflamed. This is commonly caused by local trauma associated with wearing a poorly designed shoe (often high heels) or prolonged ''walking''. It can also occur with Achilles tendonitis.''Bursitis in this part of the body often occurs as an overuse injury in young athletes, ice skaters, and people starting new ''exercise'' programs, including walking or jumping. The pain is usually on the back of the heel and increases with passive extension or resisted flexion.'""Ischiogluteal bursitis causes inflammation of the ischial bursa, which lies between the bottom of the pelvic bone and the overlying gluteus maximus muscle (one side of the buttocks). Inflammation can come from sitting for a long time on a hard surface or from bicycling. Ischiogluteal bursitis has also been called weaver's bottom because it is common from the positioning used in this occupation.""'The iliopsoas bursa is the largest in the body and lies in front of, and deep to, the hip joint. Bursitis here is usually associated with hip problems such as arthritis or injury (especially from ''running'').''The trochanteric bursa, at the outer thigh over the hip, can become inflamed to cause trochanteric bursitis. Trochanteric bursitis is very common and occurs most frequently in overweight, middle-aged women.'   Overhead lifting or reaching activities are uncomfortable. Pain is often worse at night. The shoulder will usually have decreased range of active motion and be tender at specific spots. The pain may increase if the elbow is bent because tension increases over the bursa. This bursa is frequently exposed to direct trauma (bumping your arm) or repeated motions from bending and extending the elbow (while painting, for example). Infection is common in this bursa. Bursitis in front of the kneecap (prepatellar): Swelling on the front of the kneecap can be caused by chronic trauma (as from kneeling) or an acute blow to the knee. Swelling may occur as late as seven to 10 days after a single blow to the area, usually from a fall. Prepatellar bursitis has also been called carpet-layer's knee, housemaid's knee, and clergyman's knee. Pes anserine bursitis: The pes anserine bursa is fan shaped and lies among three of the major tendons at the inner knee.This type of bursitis is most often seen in people with arthritis, especially overweight middle-aged women with osteoarthritis.The pain of anserine bursitis is typically produced when the knee is bent and is particularly troublesome at night. People often seek comfort in bed by sleeping with a pillow between their thighs.The pain can radiate to the inner thigh and mid-calf and usually increases on climbing stairs and at extremes of bending and extending.Pes anserine bursitis also occurs as an overuse or traumatic injury among athletes, particularly long-distance runners. This type of bursitis is most often seen in people with arthritis, especially overweight middle-aged women with osteoarthritis. The pain of anserine bursitis is typically produced when the knee is bent and is particularly troublesome at night. People often seek comfort in bed by sleeping with a pillow between their thighs. The pain can radiate to the inner thigh and mid-calf and usually increases on climbing stairs and at extremes of bending and extending. Pes anserine bursitis also occurs as an overuse or traumatic injury among athletes, particularly long-distance runners. The pain occurs when sitting and walking. There will be tenderness over the pubic bone, which may be made worse by bending and extending the leg. The pain may radiate down the back of the thigh. Direct pressure over the area causes sharp pain. The person may hold the painful buttock elevated when sitting. The pain is worse when person is lying down and the hip is passively bent. The person may have difficulty standing on tiptoe on the affected side. The pain of iliopsoas bursitis radiates down the front and middle areas of the thigh to the knee and is increased when the hip is extended and rotated. Extension of the hip during walking causes pain so the person may limit the stride on the affected side and take a shorter step. There may be tenderness in the groin area. Sometimes a mass may be felt resembling a hernia. The person may also feel numbness or tingling if adjacent nerves are compressed by the inflamed bursa. Trochanteric bursitis causes deep, aching hip pain along the side of the hip that may extend into the buttocks or to the side of the knee. Pain is aggravated by activity, local pressure, or stretching. Pain is often worse at night and can make it difficult to sleep on the involved side."
When should someone seek medical care for bursitis?,"'Because bursitis can be infectious and needs to be treated with antibiotics, it is best to see a doctor the first time you recognize symptoms.''If the pain is not getting better with home care, your doctor may be able to offer some alternatives such as a ''cortisone injection''.''Fever'' is a definite sign to seek immediate medical care because it may signify infection. Heed other warning signs of infection such as constant warmth or redness around the joint or severe tenderness. Skin infections around the area (''cellulitis'') may mean that the bursa is infected as well.' "
What specialists diagnose and treat bursitis?,"'Bursitis is treated by primary care physicians, including family medicine doctors, general practitioners, and internists, as well as orthopedists, physiatrists, and ''rheumatologists''.' "
"What 
exams do health care professionals use to diagnose bursitis?"," History: The doctor will usually take a detailed history about the onset of symptoms and will want to know what movement or activity makes you feel more or less pain. You will need to report other medical problems you may have. Fluid removal: The doctor may remove fluid from the bursa with a needle and send it to the lab for analysis. This analysis will help determine if the bursitis is due to an infection or rheumatoid condition or trauma). Bursitis in the knee and elbow are especially prone to infection. Removal of the fluid might alleviate some of the pain. X-rays: They are usually not helpful, but the doctor may get them if any other disease is suspected such as a fracture or dislocation. MRI and CT scans are obtained only to exclude other causes. Blood testing: The doctor may order blood tests to rule out infection or other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis."
What are bursitis treatments?,"'The doctor will probably recommend home care with P-R-I-C-E-M: protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation, and medications (discussed below).' "
"Are 
there bursitis home remedies?","'The treatment for bursitis can be remembered with the following memory device: P-R-I-C-E-M.' Protection includes padding especially for bursae close to the surface of the skin on the ankles and knees. Relative rest of the affected area if possible may help symptoms. Choose alternate types of exercise activities that eliminate painful motions. Swimming may help rather than hurt. Ice is very effective in reducing inflammation and pain. Small ice packs, such as packages of frozen vegetables, applied to the area for 10 minutes at least twice a day may help decrease inflammation. Compression and elevation are helpful when it is feasible to compress the area. An elastic bandage can be applied (especially to knees and elbows). Keep the area elevated above the heart to keep blood from pooling there. Medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil) can be helpful to reduce inflammation and pain. Consult your doctor before taking these if you are on any blood-thinning medications or have a history of stomach ulcers or kidney disease."
What is the medical treatment for bursitis?,"'If your bursitis is not infectious, the doctor may inject the bursa with a ''corticosteroid'' to reduce inflammation.''If your bursitis is infectious, the bursa will be drained with a needle. The doctor will prescribe antibiotics to be taken in pill form. If the infection is very serious, does not respond to oral antibiotics, or if your immune system is weakened for another reason, you may be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. Most causes of infectious bursitis, however, can be managed safely at home. Occasionally, a surgical operation to remove the bursa can be required.'  "
How often is follow-up needed after treatment of bursitis?,"""After you leave the doctor's office, try to change whatever caused the bursitis in the first place. Wear different shoes. Use kneepads when kneeling for activities or work.""'Rest the area and apply ice at least twice a day, keeping the area elevated when possible.''Schedule a follow-up visit with your doctor in one week. If your bursitis is infectious, a follow-up visit in three to four days is appropriate for reevaluation and possible fluid removal.' "
"Is 
there a way to prevent bursitis?","'If a certain activity causes you to develop bursitis, then limit that activity or use protective measures. Use kneepads or cushioning for gardening and scrubbing floors. Workers such as plumbers, roofers, and carpet layers should wear knee protection. Choose more appropriate shoes or cushion the ankles with pads.''You can improve your flexibility and strengthen muscles involved in joint motion through rehabilitative exercise.''Be concerned about muscle tone if you have bursitis that tends to return. A physical rehabilitation program can guide you in the proper exercises to strengthen weak muscles.' "
What is the prognosis for bursitis?,"'Most people respond to therapy in three to four days and can follow up with their doctor in a week. If the bursitis is infectious, however, the area may have to be drained with a needle every three to five days until the infectious fluid does not return.' "

What should you know about acute bronchitis?,"'The medical definition of acute ''bronchitis'' is a ''cough'' lasting five or more days suggests acute ''bronchitis'' as a cause. Sometimes people with recurrent acute bronchitis (flare-ups) develop ''chronic bronchitis'' and/or a ''respiratory infection''. Bronchitis is an inflammation of your bronchial tubes (the tubes that carry air to your ''lungs'' and ''makeup'' the bronchial tree).''Acute bronchitis can be ''contagious'', however, acute bronchitis caused by exposure to pollutants, tobacco smoke and other chemicals is not contagious''The primary symptom of acute bronchitis is a ''cough''. Other symptoms include sputum production, ''sore throat'', ''nasal congestion'', ''headache'', and cough up sputum or vomit ''mucus''.''The most common way people become infected with or “get” acute bronchitis is by a viral or bacterial infection; however, other causes may include irritants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, or chemicals. Some home remedies may relieve and soothe ''bronchitis symptoms''.''There are two types of bronchitis 1) acute bronchitis, and 2) chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, 2 years in a row.''Some medications may relieve bronchitis symptoms, for example, cough suppressants, ''NSAIDs'', ''acetaminophen'', and antibiotics (for ''bacterial infections'' only). In children under age 2, a pediatrician should be consulted before OCT medicines are used. In children under age 2, consult a pediatrician before using over the counter (OCT) medicine.''How do you get acute bronchitis?''Acute bronchitis is contagious if the causes is viral or bacterial, and will last until the the symptoms go away. Bronchitis usually lasts about 10 to 20 days, if it lasts longer than that you probably have chronic bronchitis, which is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production for the last three months 2 years in a row.' "
What is acute bronchitis?,"'Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes (the airways that allow air to pass from the mouth to the lungs) that usually is caused by ''viruses'' or bacteria. Although other irritants for example, smoke or pollution, also may cause the disease, they are far less frequent causes.'  "
Is acute bronchitis contagious? ,"'The majority of people with acute bronchitis are contagious if the cause is an infectious agent such as a virus or bacterium. The contagious period for both bacteria and viruses is usually as long as the patient has symptoms although for a few viruses, then maybe contagious a few days before symptoms appear. Contagious viruses that may cause acute bronchitis are listed in the causes section. Tracheobronchitis (inflammation of both the bronchiole(s) and the trachea) may lead to lung infections (respiratory infections like ''pneumonia'').''People usually are less likely to be contagious as the symptoms wane. However, acute bronchitis caused by the immune system, exposure to pollutants, tobacco smoke (including ''second-hand smoke''), or other environmental chemicals or toxins that are bronchiole and/or lung irritants are not contagious.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis?,"'Coughing'' is the most common symptom of acute bronchitis. The coughing begins early in the disease and usually lasts about 10 to 20 days as it gradually subsides. About 50% of individuals have a productive cough with either clear, yellow, greenish, or occasionally blood tinged sputum. Consequently, signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis may include:''Children may also have:''If a person develops fever, shortness of breath, ''cyanosis'' or ''chest pain'', they likely have another problem but not acute bronchitis.'   Coughing Productive cough Mild shortness of breath Sore throat Nasal congestion Headache Mild fever and chills Chest discomfort Muscle aches Fatigue Wheezing Runny nose Mild fever May gag or vomit mucus"
What causes acute bronchitis?,"'The most common cause of acute bronchitis are viral (short-term viral). There is no ""bronchitis virus” as many different types of viruses can cause bronchitis. The main genera of viruses that cause acute bronchitis include:''Many people develop mild symptoms of acute bronchitis so often that the exact virus that caused the infection is never determined. In addition, the ''common cold'' may mimic an acute bronchitis flair-up.''Bacteria are less common causes of acute bronchitis. Bacterial causes of the disease (bacterial bronchitis) include:''Other irritants (for example, tobacco smoke, chemicals, etc.) may irritate the bronchi and cause acute bronchitis. Consequently, bronchial or bronchitis infections are not the only cause of acute bronchitis.' Influenza (the same virus that causes colds) Parainfluenza RSV Rhinovirus Adenovirus Corona viruses Mycoplasma Streptococcus Bordetella Moraxella Haemophilus Chlamydia pneumoniae"
Who gets acute bronchitis?,"'Risk factors for acute bronchitis are the same as those for getting viral and bacterial infections and two include:''Being in close contact with people that are coughing, ''sneezing'', and touching items that infected persons recently handled.''People that are exposed to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and to chemicals that are aerosolized are at higher risk for acute bronchitis. Unfortunately, many people worldwide are at risk of getting this type of bronchitis. About 4.6 out of 100 individuals may develop acute bronchitis each year (or about 12.5 million in the US). The highest risks for the disease are the winter months.'  "
How can I tell if I have acute bronchitis?,"'Because acute bronchitis has many causes is often self-limiting within 10 to 20 days and its main symptom is coughing, most doctors consider the diagnosis after a history and physical without additional tests. If the diagnosis is not clear or the specific cause needs to be identified , such tests as sputum cytology, throat cultures, influenza tests, chest ''X-rays'', blood ''gas'', procalcitonin levels and even ''bronchoscopy'' have been used to identify specific viral, bacterial and other sources or causes or rule out more severe illnesses (such as a ''pneumonia''). Usually, the symptoms of acute bronchitis are mild to moderate and symptoms like cough are treated for a few days before a more extensive workup is begun.' "
How long does acute bronchitis last?,"'Chronic bronchitis is defined as a cough that occurs every day with sputum production that lasts for at least 3 months, 2 years in a row. However, acute bronchitis may develop into chronic bronchitis in some individuals and even lead to ''COPD'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'').' A cough lasting five or more days suggests acute bronchitis as a cause. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 to 20 days. People with recurrent acute bronchitis may develop chronic bronchitis."
What natural or home remedies treat and cure acute bronchitis?,"'Home remedies may help reduce acute bronchitis symptoms. For example:''If symptoms worsen, see your doctor. For children under age 2 (and some doctors recommend under age 6), the doctor should be consulted before OTC medicines are used.'   Stay well hydrated by drinking fluids Use a humidifier to moisten the air. Avoid dairy products because they thicken mucous secretions Avoid alcohol and caffeine because of potential drug interactions Avoid exposure to environmental smoke and other air pollutants Over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressants and cough drops can help reduce coughing symptoms."
What is the treatment for acute bronchitis?,"'Bed rest and supportive care such as reducing coughing are the main treatments for acute bronchitis. Usually, antibiotics are not needed, especially if bronchitis has viral or environmental causes.''For some people who have wheezing with their cough, ''bronchodilators'' (beta2 agonists) may be helpful.''The most useful treatments are directed at reducing cough symptoms with over the counter preparations containing ''guaifenesin'' (an expectorant) and a mucolytic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) often are added to reduce inflammation and help relieve discomfort. However, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' does not recommend giving OTC cough and ''cold'' medications to children under two years of age. These medicines may cause harmful side effects that can be life-threatening to young children. Side effects include organ toxicity (kidneys, for example) and death.'  "
What medications treat and cure acute bronchitis?,"'The following medication(s) may be helpful for people with acute bronchitis.''Do not give drugs like NSAIDs and ''aspirin'"" to young children and young adults due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Check with a pediatrician before giving over-the-counter medicine to your child.""'Primary care physicians and pediatricians often treat acute bronchitis. If acute bronchitis reoccurs (recurring bronchitis), other specialties such as allergists, infectious disease or ENT specialists may be consulted. If you are ''pregnant'', consult your OB/GYN or ''Midwife''.' Robitussin and Delsym: Use this medicine sparingly because coughing helps remove irritants from the air passages, and you want to cough these irritants out of these passges in the lungs. Mucolytics (Mucinex, Mucomyst): These medicines help remove sticky mucus from the airways. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) may reduce inflammation and/or discomfort. Inhaler bronchodilators: This medicine opens airways, which makes it easier to breathe. Antibiotics: Acute bronchitis is treated with antibiotics only if the cause is bacterial (suspected or diagnosed). Reports indicate that about 65%-80% of people with acute bronchitis receive an antibiotic despite evidence that antibiotics are not effective in treating acute bronchitis (with a few exceptions). Antibiotics are not recommended for routine acute bronchitis treatment."
When should I contact my doctor about acute bronchitis?,"'Most people do not need to contact their doctor since acute bronchitis is usually limited to about 10 to 20 days and then resolves. However, call your doctor or other healthcare professional if your symptoms become severe or if you develop a fever that does not go down. Moreover, if other symptoms develop (short of breath, ''night sweats''), if the symptoms persist past about 20 day, or if you have repeated bouts of acute bronchitis during the year, you should contact your doctor.''If you think your child has acute bronchitis (especially those aged two and under), call your pediatrician to have your child seen. Some doctors recommend that pediatricians treat children under 6 years old.' "
What are the possible complications of acute bronchitis?,"'Complications of acute bronchitis are infrequent but include a ''respiratory infection'' like ''pneumonia'' (viral and/or bacterial), chronic bronchitis, ''asthma'', and ''sinusitis''. In addition, depending on the pathogen, complications include ''tuberculosis'', ''whooping cough'' (''pertussis''), and other infectious lung diseases. It may eventually lead to development of ''COPD''.'  "
What should I know about acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?,"'*''Acute flaccid myelitis'' (''AFM'') facts written by Charles P. Davis, MD, PhD''What is the medical definition of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?''Acute flaccid myelitis is a rare condition of the nervous system that causes the muscles and reflexes of the body to weaken. ''Viruses'', toxins, and genetic disorders can all cause acute flaccid myelitis. ''Viruses'' that can cause the condition or similar symptoms include poliovirus, ''non-polio enteroviruses'', ''adenovirus'', or ''West Nile virus''. The exact cause of most cases is not definitively known. However, development of acute flaccid myelitis is extremely rare. It is estimated that less than one in 1 million people in the US develop this condition every year. Symptoms are a sudden onset of arm or leg ''weakness'' and loss of muscle tone and reflexes. Other symptoms can include facial droop, ''eyelid'' droop, difficulty moving the eyes, facial ''weakness'', slurred speech, or problems with swallowing. Respiratory failure is the most serious potential symptom. Even though the condition is very rare, the US CDC has received reports of an increasing number of cases of acute flaccid myelitis since 2014; most of the reported cases have occurred in children.''How do I know if I have/What are the early signs of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?''How do I know if I have acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?''How do I get rid of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?' Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious problem with the nervous system in the area of the spinal cord (gray matter) that causes muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. The condition began increasing in frequency in 2014. It occurs mainly in children and very rarely in adults. AFM is not contagious person to person but may spread to humans from mosquitoes. AFM symptoms and signs usually have a sudden onset that begins with arm or leg weakness along with loss of muscle tone and reflexes. In addition, patients may have facial droop difficulty moving their eyes drooping eyelids and/or difficulty with swallowing or speaking (slurred speech), with the most severe symptom being respiratory failure. Viruses, environmental toxins, and/or genetic disorders may cause AFM and similar neurological conditions. Viruses that may cause AFM or similar conditions are poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses (especially enterovirus 68), West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and adenoviruses. AFM often has no identifiable cause despite lab tests. Tests that doctors use to diagnose AFM include a detailed physical exam the person's nervous system and a review of spinal cord images with CT/MRI. In addition, medical professionals perform other lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (for example, detection of viruses) because of AFM shares many of the same symptoms as other neurological diseases such as transverse myelitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Some neurologists may do nerve conduction tests. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for AFM. Some neurologists may recommend physical and occupational therapy, but the long-term prognosis and recovery from AFM is unknown."
About Acute Flaccid Myelitis,"'Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare but serious condition. It affects the nervous system, specifically the area of spinal cord called ''gray matter'', which causes the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak. This condition is not new, but the increase in cases we saw starting in 2014 is new. Still, CDC estimates that less than one in a million people in the United States will get AFM every year. There are a variety of possible causes of AFM, such as viruses, environmental toxins, and genetic disorders. Most of the cases that CDC has learned about have been in children.' "
Symptoms,"'Most people will have sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes. Some people, in addition to arm or leg weakness, will have:''Numbness or tingling is rare in people with AFM, although some people have ''pain'' in their arms or legs. Some people with AFM may be unable to pass urine (pee). The most severe symptom of AFM is respiratory failure that can happen when the muscles involved with ''breathing'' become weak. This can require urgent ventilator support (''breathing'' machine). In very rare cases, it is possible that the process in the body that triggers AFM may also trigger other serious neurologic complications that could lead to death.''If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, you should seek medical care right away. Your doctor may collect information about your symptoms and send this information to their health departments. This is because CDC is asking doctors to be alert for patients with symptoms of AFM so that we can learn more about this condition.'   facial droop/weakness, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, or difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech."
Possible Causes of AFM,"'AFM or similar neurologic conditions may have a variety of possible causes such as viruses, environmental toxins, and genetic disorders.''Certain viruses that can cause AFM or similar neurologic conditions are'""Oftentimes, despite extensive lab tests, the cause of a patient's AFM is not identified."" poliovirus and non-polio enteroviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and viruses in the same family as WNV, specifically Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus, and adenoviruses."
Diagnosis,"""AFM is diagnosed by examining a patient's nervous system in combination with reviewing pictures of the spinal cord. A doctor can examine a patient's nervous system and the places on the body where he or she has weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes. A doctor can also do an ""'MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'"") to look at a patient's brain and spinal cord, do lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord), and may check nerve conduction (impulse sent along a nerve ""'fiber'') and response. It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the patient develops symptoms.''AFM can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, like transverse myelitis and ''Guillain-Barre syndrome''. With the help of testing and examinations, doctors can distinguish between AFM and other neurologic conditions.'  "
Treatment,"'There is no specific treatment for AFM, but a doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (''neurologist'') may recommend certain interventions on a case-by-case basis. For example, neurologists may recommend physical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness caused by AFM. We do not know the long-term outcomes (prognosis) of people with AFM.' "
Prevention,"'Poliovirus and ''West Nile virus'' may sometimes lead to AFM.'""While we don't know if it is effective in preventing AFM, washing your hands often with soap and water is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to other people. Learn about when and how to wash your hands."" You can protect yourself and your children from poliovirus by getting vaccinated. You can protect against bites from mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, by using mosquito repellent, staying indoors at dusk and dawn (when bites are more common), and removing standing or stagnant water near your home (where mosquitoes can breed)."
What is ARDS?,"""ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.""'People who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. They might already be in the hospital when they develop ARDS.'""To understand ARDS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).""""Small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. Oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. Blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.""""In ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause the lung's capillaries to leak more fluid than normal into the air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.""""As a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. Without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.""'People who develop ''ARDS'"" often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ""'ARDS'', such as severe pneumonia.''If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.' "
ARDS symptoms and signs,"""The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.""'Other signs and symptoms depend on the cause of the ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if ''pneumonia'' is causing ARDS, you may have a ''cough'' and ''fever'' before you feel short of breath.''Sometimes, people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as ''low blood pressure'', ''confusion'"", and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and ""'heart'"", aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.""""Most people who develop ARDS are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.""'If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.'  "
What causes ARDS?,"'Many conditions or factors can directly or indirectly injure the lungs and lead to ARDS. Some common ones are:'""It's not clear why some very sick or seriously injured people develop ARDS and others don't. Researchers are trying to find out why ARDS develops and how to prevent it."" Sepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream. Pneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs. Severe bleeding caused by an injury to the body. An injury to the chest or head, like a severe blow. Breathing in harmful fumes or smoke. Inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth."
Who is at risk?,"'People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.''Conditions that can directly injure the lungs include:''Conditions that can indirectly injure the lungs include:' Pneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs. Breathing in harmful fumes or smoke. Inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth. Using a ventilator. This is a machine that helps people breathe; rarely, it can injure the lungs. Nearly drowning. Sepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream. Severe bleeding caused by an injury to the body or having many blood transfusions. An injury to the chest or head, such as a severe blow. Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-a-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas becomes irritated or infected. The pancreas is a gland that releases enzymes and hormones. Fat embolism (EM-bo-lizm). This is a condition in which fat blocks an artery. A physical injury, like a broken bone, can lead to a fat embolism. Drug reaction."
How do doctors diagnose the condition?,"'Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.''Your doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS.''Your doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as ''heart failure''. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.''ARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.''He or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.''Your doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.''You may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.''The first tests done are:''Other tests used to diagnose ARDS include:'   An arterial blood gas test. This blood test shows the oxygen level in your blood. A low level of oxygen in the blood may be a sign of ARDS. Chest X-ray. This test is used to take pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can show whether you have extra fluid in your lungs. Blood tests, such as a complete blood count, blood chemistries, and blood cultures. These tests help find the cause of ARDS, such as an infection. A sputum culture. This test is used to study the spit you've coughed up from your lungs. A sputum culture can help find the cause of an infection. Chest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or chest CT scan. This test uses a computer to create detailed pictures of your lungs. A chest CT scan may show lung problems, such as fluid in the lungs, signs of pneumonia, or a tumor. Heart tests that look for signs of heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This condition can cause fluid to build up in your lungs."
How is ARDS treated?,"""ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.""'One of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.'""Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a ""'breathing tube''. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.''Before inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.''The breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.''Your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.'""You'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).""'This procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a ''tracheostomy'' (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.''Supportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:'   Medicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain. Ongoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange). Nutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube. Treatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections. Prevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots. Prevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk. Fluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels."
What are the complications from ARDS?,"'If you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are:' Infections. Being in the hospital and lying down for a long time can put you at risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also puts you at higher risk for infections. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This is a condition in which air or gas collects in the space around the lungs. This can cause one or both lungs to collapse. The air pressure from a ventilator can cause this condition. Lung scarring. ARDS causes the lungs to become stiff (scarred) and makes it hard for them to expand and fill with air. Being on a ventilator also can cause lung scarring. Blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in your body. A blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body is called a deep vein thrombosis. This type of blood clot can break off, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism."
Living with ARDS,"'Some people fully recover from ARDS. Others continue to have health problems. After you go home from the hospital, you may have one or more of the following problems:''These health problems may go away within a few weeks, or they may last longer. Talk with your doctor about how to deal with these issues. Also, see the suggestions below.''You can take steps to recover from ARDS and improve your quality of life. For example, ask your family and friends for help with everyday activities.''If you smoke, quit. ''Smoking'' can worsen lung problems. Talk to your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid ''secondhand smoke'' and other lung irritants, such as harmful fumes.''If you have trouble quitting ''smoking'' on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people ''quit smoking''.''Go to pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) if your doctor recommends it. Rehab might include ''exercise'' training, education, and counseling. Rehab can teach you how to return to normal activities and stay active.''Your rehab team might include doctors, nurses, and other specialists. They will work with you to create a program that meets your needs.''Living with ARDS may cause fear, ''anxiety'', ''depression'', and ''stress'"". Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking with a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life.""'Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with ARDS. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk to your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center.''Support from family and friends also can help relieve ''stress'' and ''anxiety''. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.' Shortness of breath. After treatment, many people who have ARDS recover close-to-normal lung function within 6 months. For others, it may take longer. Some people have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Tiredness and muscle weakness. Being in the hospital and on a ventilator (a machine that supports breathing) can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired following treatment. Depression. Many people who've had ARDS feel depressed for a while after treatment. Problems with memory and thinking clearly. Certain medicines and a low blood oxygen level can cause these problems."
What is the prognosis and survival rate for ARDS?,"'More people are surviving ARDS now than in the past. One likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. Survival rates for ARDS vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ARDS, associated illnesses, and other factors. Some studies estimate that the mortality rate for ARDS is 36% to 52% per 100,000 people, depending upon their current health condition.''Some people who survive recover completely. Others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.''Researchers continue to look for new and better ways to treat ARDS.' "
What are other names for ARDS?," Acute lung injury Adult respiratory distress syndrome Increased-permeability pulmonary edema Noncardiac pulmonary edema ARDS used to be called stiff lung, shock lung, and wet lung."
Facts you should know about sexual addiction," Sexual addiction, also often referred to as hypersexuality, sexual dependency and compulsive sexual behavior disorder, is a condition that involves the sufferer becoming excessively preoccupied with thoughts or behaviors that give a desired sexual effect. More than 30 million people suffer from a sexual addiction in the United States alone. Paraphilias are disorders that involve the sufferer becoming sexually aroused by objects or actions considered less conventional and/or less easily accessible to the sex addict. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) classifies sexual addictions as specific paraphilic disorders or as other specified paraphilic disorders. No one factor causes sexual addiction, but there are thought to be biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders. Sex addicts suffer from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress. As is true with virtually any other mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information to distinguish sexual addiction from medical and other mental health disorders. Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of recovery groups or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). When compulsive sexual behaviors become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment or participation in an intensive outpatient treatment program. Serotonergic (SSRI) antidepressants, antiseizure medications, naltrexone, and medications that decrease male hormones decrease the compulsive urges and/or impulses associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers. The prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors. Prevention of sexual addiction may involve interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image, addressing emotional problems, educating children about the dangers of excessive internet use, monitoring and limiting computer use, and screening out pornographic sites. Sex addiction is associated with a number of potential medical, occupational, legal, social, and emotional complications. Research on sexual addiction includes exploring potential risk factors and developing accurate screening and assessment tools for these disorders."
"What is sexual addiction, and what are the types of sexual addiction?","'Hypersexuality, sexual dependency, and compulsive sexual behavior disorder are other names for sexual addiction. As with other dependencies, sexual addiction is a condition that involves the sufferer becoming excessively preoccupied with thoughts or behaviors that give a desired effect. It involves spending an exorbitant amount of time thinking about and/or engaging in sexually addictive behaviors. Examples of sexual behavioral addictions may involve easily accessible or less accessible (paraphilic) behaviors. Examples of more easily accessible addictive acts may include having one-night stands or multiple affairs, contacts with prostitutes, viewing pornographic pictures or videos, or compulsive ''masturbation''. The sufferer may engage in behaviors like frequenting chat rooms, engaging in personal ads, or making obscene phone calls.''Statistics show that a small percentage of college-aged people suffer from a sex addiction at any one time. In the general adult population, about 12 million people have a sex addiction.''Paraphilias are disorders that involve the sufferer becoming sexually aroused by objects or actions that are less conventional or less easily accessible to the addict. Examples of paraphilias include ''fetishism'' (arousal by objects or specific body parts), ''voyeurism'' (arousal by watching sexual behaviors), ''exhibitionism'' (arousal by having others view his or her sexual behaviors) and pedophilia (arousal by sexual contact with children). When paraphilias include the sufferer having obsessions about the object of their desire, they may be considered sexually addicted. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM) only refers to nonparaphilic sexual addictions in the category of sexual disorder, not otherwise specified.''Sexually addictive behaviors have been described in modern times for more than 100 years. During the 19th century, people described sex addicts as frenetic masturbators and as having nymphomania (primarily ascribed to women), satyriasis (primarily assigned to men), compulsive sexuality, and sexual intoxication.' "
What are causes and risk factors for sexual addiction?,"'Though no single factor causes sexual addiction, there are biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to the development of these disorders. For example, the intoxication associated with sexual addiction is the result of changes in certain areas and chemicals in the brain elicited by the compulsion. Research differs somewhat in terms of gender-based patterns of sexual addiction. For example, some studies describe males who are introverted and highly educated as more inclined to develop an Internet addiction, including sexual Internet addiction. Other studies indicate that middle-aged women using home computers were more at risk for Internet sexual addiction.''Psychological risk factors for sexual addiction include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The presence of a ''learning disability'' increases the risk of developing a sex addiction as well. As people with a history of suffering from drug, porn, or any other addiction are at risk for developing another addiction, being dependent on something else makes it more likely for sexual addiction to occur.''Sufferers of these disorders tend to be socially isolated and have personality traits like insecurity, ''impulsivity'', compulsivity, trouble with relationship stability and intimacy, low ability to tolerate frustration, and a tendency to have trouble coping with emotions. People who suffer sexual abuse are at somewhat higher risk of developing a sexual addiction.' "
What are sexual addiction symptoms and signs?,"'While the ''DSM'' has yet to describe specific diagnostic criteria for nonparaphilic sex addictions, some researchers have suggested symptoms and signs that are similar to other addictions for both paraphilic and nonparaphilic sex addictions. Specifically, sex addicts suffer from a negative pattern of sexual behavior that leads to significant problems or distress that may include the following:' A need for more amount or intensity of behavior to achieve the desired effect (tolerance) Physical or psychological feelings of withdrawal when unable to engage in the addictive behavior The person making plans for, engaging in, or recovering from the behavior more or longer than planned Desire or unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behavior Neglecting important social, work, or school activities because of the behavior Continuing the behavior despite suffering physical or psychological problems because of or worsened by the sexual behavior."
How do medical professionals assess and diagnose sexual addiction?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a sexual addiction. Therefore, health care practitioners diagnose these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse, physician's assistant, or certified counselor will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might have mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from sexual obsession or compulsions but also ''depression'' or ''manic'' symptoms, ''anxiety'', ''alcoholism'' or other ''substance abuse'', ''hallucinations'' or ''delusions'', as well as some personality and behavioral disorders that may have excessive sexual activity as part of the associated symptoms. Practitioners may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for sexual addiction. Since some of the symptoms of sex addiction can also be co-occurring with other mental illnesses, the mental health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from an ''anxiety disorder'' like ''panic disorder'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), or the cyclical ''mood swings'' of ''bipolar disorder''. The examiner also explores whether the person with a sex addiction suffers from other mental illnesses like ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'' or a ''drug addiction'', personality, or behavior disorder like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').''Any condition associated with hypersexual disordered behavior, like some developmental disorders, ''borderline personality disorder'', dependent personality disorder, ''antisocial personality disorder'', or ''multiple personality disorder'"" (MPD), may be particularly challenging to distinguish from a sex addiction. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care practitioners perform a mental-status examination, as well.""'In an effort to establish a sexual addiction diagnosis, health care professionals will work to distinguish sexual addictions from medical conditions that may include hypersexual symptoms. Examples of such conditions include ''seizures'', tumors, ''dementia'"", and Huntington's disease, which may involve injuries to certain areas of the brain like the frontal or temporal lobes and therefore affect behavior."" "
What is the treatment for sexual addiction?,"'Many people with a sexual addiction benefit from the support and structure of self-help recovery groups like Sex Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Therapists often use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help individuals with sex addiction learn their individual triggers for sexually destructive (acting out) behaviors, reevaluating distortions in their thoughts that contribute to their acting out behaviors, and ultimately controlling those behaviors. Some mental health professionals also use psychodynamic ''psychotherapy'"" to address sexual addiction. That approach to treatment focuses more on the addict's basic internal emotional developmental difficulties that contribute to the development of their hypersexual disorder. These difficulties began during childhood, often as a part of the afflicted person's relationships with early caretakers. When sexual compulsions become severe, the sufferer may require inpatient treatment centers or intensive outpatient programs.""'Serotonergic (SSRI) medications that are treatment options for depressive and ''anxiety'' disorders and mood stabilizers that treat ''bipolar disorder'' also decrease the compulsive urges associated with sexual addictions for some sufferers. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').''People generally tolerate SSRIs well, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', ''agitation'', ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (''decreased libido''), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs. High ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and ''heart''-rhythm disturbances characterizes serotonergic syndrome. This condition is very rare and appears only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.''Mood stabilizers like ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') sometimes treat ''OCD'', particularly in individuals who also suffer from ''bipolar disorder'"". They may also be helpful in decreasing the impulsive behaviors suffered by some sex addicts. The side effects that professionals look for tend to vary depending on the prescribed medication. Health care professionals tend to watch for mild side effects like sleepiness when using Depakote or Tegretol or stomach upset when using one of those medications or Lamictal. Health care professionals also monitor patients for serious side effects like severely low white blood cell count in people taking Tegretol or severe autoimmune symptoms like Steven Johnson's syndrome in those taking Depakote and Lamictal.""'Naltrexone, a medication that decreases the effects of narcotic medications, may be useful for decreasing the sexual compulsions, sex drive, or arousal of some sex offenders. That may be particularly important for people who have a sexual addiction and seek celibacy to abstain from their compulsive sexual activity. That has also been found for medications that decrease male hormones, called anti-androgens. One example of an anti-androgenic medication is ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate (MPA), also known by its trade name of ''Depo-Provera''.' "
What is the prognosis of sexual addiction?,"'Studies show that the prognosis of sexual addictions depends on a number of factors, including the type of addiction, whether or not it involves paraphilic behaviors or, sexually violent behaviors, or if the person with the hypersexual disorder who engages in sexually violent behaviors suffers from another mental health diagnosis. For sexual offenders, factors that indicate a poor treatment prognosis include a higher number and more than one kind of sexual offences, having a previous criminal history, offending against boys outside their own family, low empathy for their victim, increased anger at the time of the offense, violent sexual fantasies, and attitudes that their victim enjoys it. Choosing an occupation that puts the offender in close proximity to potential victims and the use of sadomasochistic or pedophilic pornography are also associated with a worse prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent sexual addiction?,"'As the driving forces for sexual addiction seem to be more poor self-esteem rather than excessive thrill seeking, interventions that enhance self-esteem and self-image appear to be key in preventing these disorders. Suggestions for preventing Internet addiction may be useful in the prevention of sexual Internet addiction and include parents educating their children about the dangers of such behaviors, monitoring and limiting computer use, screening out pornographic Internet sites, offering other activities that do not involve computer use, and having a therapist address emotional problems like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'', which are risk factors for developing a sexual addiction.' "
What are complications of sexual addiction?,"'There are a number of potentially devastating complications of sexual addiction. Possible medical complications include contracting ''sexually transmitted diseases'', including the potentially fatal ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') or ''hepatitis B'' or C. Examples of occupational consequences include decreased work performance or attendance due to the preoccupation with the addiction. If the behaviors result in unwanted sexual advances on others, legal problems like sexual harassment or ''rape'' perpetration may result. Individuals whose sexual addiction involves attraction to minors might engage in child molestation.''Depending on the financial demands of the addiction, the sufferer of a sexual addiction may incur a great deal of debt or engage in illegal or otherwise unsafe activity associated with the behavior. Emotionally, individuals with a sexual addiction are at risk for terrible guilt and shame at their actions and the secrecy involved. They are also more likely to experience broken relationships, separation, divorce, and the many challenges involved.' "

What is the latest research on sexual addiction?,'Research on sexual addiction includes developing accurate screening and assessment tools for these disorders. Medical researchers are exploring the possibility that some paraphilias run in families.' 
What is Addison's disease?,"""Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by ""'weight loss'', muscle weakness, ''fatigue'', ''low blood pressure'', and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.' "
How does Addison's disease occur?,"""Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism.""  "
What is cortisol?,"""Cortisol is normally produced by the adrenal glands, located just above the kidneys. It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids, which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol's most important job is to help the body respond to ""'stress''. Among its other vital tasks, cortisol:' helps maintain blood pressure and heart function helps slow the immune system's inflammation response helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for energy helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats helps maintain proper arousal and sense of well-being"
How is cortisol regulated?,"""Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol is regulated by the brain's hypothalamus and the ""'pituitary gland'', a bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends ""releasing hormones"" to the pituitary gland. The pituitary responds by secreting hormones that regulate growth and thyroid and adrenal function, and sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. One of the pituitary\'s main functions is to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals receive the pituitary\'s signal in the form of ACTH, they respond by producing cortisol. Completing the cycle, cortisol then signals the pituitary to lower secretion of ACTH.' "
What is aldosterone?,"'Aldosterone belongs to a class of hormones called mineralocorticoids, also produced by the adrenal glands. It helps maintain blood pressure and water and salt balance in the body by helping the kidney retain sodium and excrete potassium. When aldosterone production falls too low, the kidneys are not able to regulate salt and water balance, causing blood volume and blood pressure to drop.' "
What causes Addison's disease?,'Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).'  
Primary adrenal insufficiency,"""Addison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. Up to 80 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome."" "
Polyendocrine deficiency syndrome,"'The polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II.''Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:'""Type II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:""'Scientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is ''inherited'' because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies. ' underactive parathyroid glands  slow sexual development  pernicious anemia  chronic candida infections  chronic active hepatitis  hair loss (in very rare cases)  an underactive thyroid gland  slow sexual development  diabetes  vitiligo  loss of pigment on areas of the skin "
Tuberculosis,"'Tuberculosis'' (''TB''), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at ''autopsy'' in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.' "
Other causes,"'Less common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are: ' chronic infection, mainly fungal infections  cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands  amyloidosis  surgical removal of the adrenal glands "
Secondary adrenal insufficiency,"""This form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as ""'prednisone'' for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''asthma'', or ''ulcerative colitis'', block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. '""Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. ""'Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from: ' tumors or infections of the area  loss of blood flow to the pituitary  radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors  surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus  surgical removal of the pituitary gland "
What are the signs and symptoms of Addison's disease?,"'The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency usually begin gradually.

How is Addison's disease diagnosed?,"""In its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. A review of a patient's medical history based on the symptoms, especially the dark tanning of the skin, will lead a doctor to suspect Addison's disease.""""A diagnosis of Addison's disease is made by laboratory tests. The aim of these tests is first to determine whether levels of cortisol are insufficient and then to establish the cause. X-ray exams of the adrenal and pituitary glands also are useful in helping to establish the cause.""""This is the most specific test for diagnosing Addison's disease. In this test, blood cortisol, urine cortisol, or both are measured before and after a synthetic form of ACTH is given by injection. In the so-called short, or rapid, ACTH test, measurement of cortisol in blood is repeated 30 to 60 minutes after an intravenous ACTH injection. The normal response after an injection of ACTH is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. Patients with either form of adrenal insufficiency respond poorly or do not respond at all.""'When the response to the short ACTH test is abnormal, a ""long"" CRH stimulation test is required to determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, synthetic CRH is injected intravenously and blood cortisol is measured before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency have high ACTHs but do not produce cortisol. Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency have deficient cortisol responses but absent or delayed ACTH responses. Absent ACTH response points to the pituitary as the cause; a delayed ACTH response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.''In patients suspected of having an addisonian crisis, the doctor must begin treatment with injections of salt, fluids, and glucocorticoid hormones immediately. Although a reliable diagnosis is not possible while the patient is being treated for the crisis, measurement of blood ACTH and cortisol during the crisis and before glucocorticoids are given is enough to make the diagnosis. Once the crisis is controlled and medication has been stopped, the doctor will delay further testing for up to 1 month to obtain an accurate diagnosis.''Once a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency has been made, x-ray exams of the abdomen may be taken to see if the adrenals have any signs of calcium deposits. Calcium deposits may indicate TB. A tuberculin skin test also may be used.''If secondary adrenal insufficiency is the cause, doctors may use different imaging tools to reveal the size and shape of the pituitary gland. The most common is the CT scan, which produces a series of x-ray pictures giving a cross-sectional image of a body part. The function of the pituitary and its ability to produce other hormones also are tested.' "
How is Addison's disease treated?,"""Treatment of Addison's disease involves replacing, or substituting, the hormones that the adrenal glands are not making. Cortisol is replaced orally with hydrocortisone tablets, a synthetic glucocorticoid, taken once or twice a day. If aldosterone is also deficient, it is replaced with oral doses of a mineralocorticoid called fludrocortisone acetate (Florinef), which is taken once a day. Patients receiving aldosterone replacement therapy are usually advised by a doctor to increase their salt intake. Because patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency normally maintain aldosterone production, they do not require aldosterone replacement therapy. The doses of each of these medications are adjusted to meet the needs of individual patients.""'During an addisonian crisis, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, and high levels of potassium can be life threatening. Standard therapy involves intravenous injections of hydrocortisone, saline (salt water), and dextrose (''sugar''). This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. When the patient can take fluids and medications by mouth, the amount of hydrocortisone is decreased until a maintenance dose is achieved. If aldosterone is deficient, maintenance therapy also includes oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.'  "
Surgery,'Patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency who need surgery with general anesthesia are treated with injections of hydrocortisone and saline. Injections begin on the evening before surgery and continue until the patient is fully awake and able to take medication by mouth. The dosage is adjusted until the maintenance dosage given before surgery is reached.' 
Pregnancy,"'Women with primary adrenal insufficiency who become ''pregnant'' are treated with standard replacement therapy. If ''nausea'' and vomiting in early ''pregnancy'' interfere with oral medication, injections of the hormone may be necessary. During delivery, treatment is similar to that of patients needing surgery; following delivery, the dose is gradually tapered and the usual maintenance doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone acetate by mouth are reached by about 10 days after ''childbirth''.' "
Patient education,"""A person who has adrenal insufficiency should always carry identification stating his or her condition in case of an emergency. The card should alert emergency personnel about the need to inject 100 mg of cortisol if its bearer is found severely injured or unable to answer questions. The card should also include the doctor's name and telephone number and the name and telephone number of the nearest relative to be notified. When traveling, a needle, syringe, and an injectable form of cortisol should be carried for emergencies. A person with Addison's disease also should know how to increase medication during periods of ""'stress'' or mild upper respiratory infections. Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occur. These conditions can precipitate an addisonian crisis. A patient who is vomiting may require injections of hydrocortisone.''People with medical problems may wish to wear a descriptive warning bracelet or neck chain to alert emergency personnel.

What is pernicious anemia?,"'Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have a sufficient number of red blood cells or ''hemoglobin''. Hemoglobin is present within red blood cells and is important for carrying oxygen to all tissues of the body. In males, anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin level of less than 13.5 gram/100ml, while in women, a hemoglobin level of less than 12.0 gram/100ml is considered indicative of anemia. These definitions may vary slightly depending on the source and the laboratory reference used. Pernicious is a term that means destructive, injurious or deadly.''Anemia can result from disruptions in the production of red blood cells or hemoglobin as well as from an increased destruction of red blood cells or loss of blood.''Pernicious anemia is a disease where large, immature, nucleated cells (megaloblasts, which are forerunners of red blood cells) circulate in the blood, and do not function as blood cells; it is a disease caused by impaired uptake of vitamin B-12 due to the lack of intrinsic factor (IF) in the gastric mucosa. It was termed ""pernicious"" because before it was learned that vitamin B-12 could treat the anemia, most people that developed the disease died from it.''Pernicious anemia is due to an inability to absorb vitamin B-12 (also known as cobalamin or Cbl) from the gastrointestinal tract. Humans get vitamin B-12 from animal products; both meat and dairy products are dietary sources of vitamin B-12. The body is able to store vitamin B-12 for a long time, so inadequate dietary intake must persist for years before a true deficiency of vitamin B-12 is reached. Therefore, the symptoms of pernicious anemia usually do not appear for years. While pernicious anemia is most commonly diagnosed in adults with an average age of 60, a rare, congenital (inborn) type of pernicious anemia has been described.''As with other causes of anemia, symptoms related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood can include ''tiredness'' and ''shortness of breath''. Vitamin B-12 deficiency also interferes with the function of the nervous system, and symptoms due to nervous system damage may be apparent even before the anemia is discovered.'""Pernicious anemia is more common in Caucasian persons of northern European ancestry than in other racial groups. Pernicious anemia also is termed Biermer's or Addison's anemia."" "
What is megaloblastic anemia?,"'Sometimes, anemias are subclassified based upon the size and microscopic appearance of the red blood cells. In this regard, pernicious anemia is a form of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia refers to an abnormally large type of red blood cell (megaloblast). Megaloblasts are produced in the bone marrow when vitamin B-12 or folic acid levels are low. Megaloblastic anemia also can be caused by other disease of the bone marrow and can be a side effect of some ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' ''drugs''.'  "
What causes pernicious anemia?,"""Pernicious anemia is considered an autoimmune disease, in which the body's own immune system mistakenly damages its own tissues. It is believed that the decreased absorption of vitamin B-12 from the gastrointestinal tract in pernicious anemia results from the presence of an autoantibody against intrinsic factor (IF), a protein made in the stomach that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B-12. Normally, vitamin B-12 binds to intrinsic factor in the stomach, and this facilitates its absorption by the small intestine further along in the digestive process. Along with the autoimmune process that attacks the IF protein and lowers IF levels in stomach secretions, another autoimmune reaction against the stomach lining cells also occurs, resulting in a form of inflammation known as chronic atrophic ""'gastritis''.''Pernicious anemia is sometimes associated with other autoimmune diseases such as '""Graves' disease"""", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'' and ''vitiligo'' (depigmentation or blanching of skin areas).'  "
Is pernicious anemia the same as vitamin B-12 deficiency anemia?,"'No, pernicious anemia is one form of vitamin B-12 deficiency that results from the autoimmune process described previously. However, other causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency also can produce the same signs and symptoms as pernicious anemia. Other potential causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency include surgical removal of the stomach or a portion of the stomach (total or partial gastrectomy), other gastrointestinal diseases such as ''celiac disease'"" or Crohn's disease, infections of the gastrointestinal tract, longstanding use of acid-reducing medications, and poor ""'nutrition''.' "
What are the symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency/pernicious anemia?,"'As discussed previously, true pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune condition that impairs absorption of dietary vitamin B-12, resulting in vitamin B-12 deficiency. Vitamin B-12 deficiency of any cause, including pernicious anemia, will result in anemia and neurologic symptoms. Because the body has large stores of vitamin B-12, a deficiency takes many years to establish.''Vitamin B-12 deficiency affects the nervous system, leading to a variety of symptoms. Sometimes, these may be apparent before symptoms related to the anemia. Neurological symptoms vary and may be nonspecific (meaning that these are symptoms that can be caused by a number of different conditions). Feelings of numbness, tingling, ''weakness'', lack of coordination, clumsiness, impaired memory, and personality changes can all occur. Both sides of the body are usually affected, and the legs are typically more affected than the arms. A severe deficiency can result in more serious neurological symptoms, including severe weakness, ''spasticity'', paraplegia, and fecal and ''urinary incontinence''.''Symptoms of anemia are due to the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Shortness of breath, ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', and ''pale skin'' can all occur with anemia. In anemia, the ''heart'' is placed under ''stress'' since it has to work harder to deliver enough oxygen to body tissues. This can result in ''heart murmurs'', fast heartbeats, arrhythmias, an ''enlarged heart'' (cardiomegaly), or even ''heart failure''. It is important to note that not all people who have vitamin B-12 deficiency and neurological symptoms also will have anemia.''A deficiency of vitamin B-12 also can alter the surface of the tongue, making it appear shiny or smooth.''Finally, sometimes pernicious anemia is diagnosed in a patient with no symptoms. In these cases, it is usually found incidentally when blood tests are ordered for another reason.'  "
What kinds of doctors treat pernicious anemia?,'Pernicious anemia may be treated by internal or family medicine specialists as well as specialists in disorders of the blood (hematologists).' 
How is pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency diagnosed?,"'The first step is always a thorough history and physical examination by a health care practitioner. The results of this examination are used to help direct further testing. A number of laboratory tests are available that can help diagnose pernicious anemia as well as other causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency. These tests include:' A complete blood cell count (CBC) Examination of a blood smear (peripheral smear) under a microscope, often performed in association with a CBC Blood vitamin B-12 level measurements Tests for the presence of autoantibodies to intrinsic factor or stomach lining cells Blood levels of iron and iron-binding capacity Folate levels (which are often reduced when vitamin B-12 levels are low) Blood levels of methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, both of which may be sensitive indicators of vitamin B-12 deficiency The Schilling test, a measure of how well the body can absorb vitamin B-12, is less commonly used today than in the past. Finally, bone marrow aspiration or bone marrow biopsy may be recommended in some cases if bone marrow disorders are suspected"
What is the treatment for pernicious anemia and vitamin B-12 deficiency?,"'The symptoms of pernicious anemia and vitamin B-12 deficiency can be treated by replenishing the vitamin B-12 supply in the body. If a condition other than pernicious anemia is responsible for vitamin B-12 deficiency, treatment also must be directed at the underlying condition. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency may be improved after just a few days of medical treatment.''Vitamin B-12 is typically given as an intramuscular injection (shot). An injection of 1000 micrograms (1 mg) of vitamin B-12 is generally given every day for one week, followed by 1 mg every week for four weeks and then 1 mg every month thereafter.''Alternative treatments for pernicious anemia include high-dose oral vitamin B-12, since a lower-efficiency absorption system for vitamin B-12 exists in the intestine that does not require the presence of IF. However, the oral dose required for this type of therapy (1 to 2 milligrams/day) is more than 200 times higher than the minimum daily vitamin B-12 requirement for adults and is significantly higher than that available in most standard ''multivitamins'' and B-12 ''supplements''. Nasal spray and sublingual (under the tongue) preparations of vitamin B-12 also are available and are under investigation.'  "
Can pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency be prevented?,"'The autoimmune process that causes pernicious anemia cannot be prevented. Vitamin B-12 deficiency that is caused by conditions such as other gastrointestinal diseases and gastrointestinal surgery is preventable only to the extent that these causative conditions themselves are preventable.''Vitamin B-12 is derived from animal (for example, meat, fish, poultry, milk) sources, but vitamin B-12 deficiency in vegetarians or vegans can be prevented by the use of oral vitamin B-12 ''supplements''. An oral dose of 100-200 micrograms (mcg) taken weekly is sufficient. ''Pregnant'' and ''nursing'' women who are vegetarians or vegan should take a B-12 supplement and inform their doctors they are vegetarians or vegan.' "
What is the prognosis for pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency? Can it be cured?,"'If untreated, the neurological complications of pernicious anemia can be permanent and end in death, but pernicious anemia is easily and effectively treated by the administration of vitamin B-12. Life-long treatment is required.''People with pernicious anemia have a slightly increased risk of ''stomach cancer'' when compared to the normal population. The incidence of stomach ''cancer'' in people with pernicious anemia is 2-3 times higher than in the general population of the same age.' "
What is Addison's disease?,"""Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by ""'weight loss'', muscle weakness, ''fatigue'', ''low blood pressure'', and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.' "
How does Addison's disease occur?,"""Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism.""  "
What is cortisol?,"""Cortisol is normally produced by the adrenal glands, located just above the kidneys. It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids, which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol's most important job is to help the body respond to ""'stress''. Among its other vital tasks, cortisol:' helps maintain blood pressure and heart function helps slow the immune system's inflammation response helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for energy helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats helps maintain proper arousal and sense of well-being"
How is cortisol regulated?,"""Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol is regulated by the brain's hypothalamus and the ""'pituitary gland'', a bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends ""releasing hormones"" to the pituitary gland. The pituitary responds by secreting hormones that regulate growth and thyroid and adrenal function, and sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. One of the pituitary\'s main functions is to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals receive the pituitary\'s signal in the form of ACTH, they respond by producing cortisol. Completing the cycle, cortisol then signals the pituitary to lower secretion of ACTH.' "
What is aldosterone?,"'Aldosterone belongs to a class of hormones called mineralocorticoids, also produced by the adrenal glands. It helps maintain blood pressure and water and salt balance in the body by helping the kidney retain sodium and excrete potassium. When aldosterone production falls too low, the kidneys are not able to regulate salt and water balance, causing blood volume and blood pressure to drop.' "
What causes Addison's disease?,'Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).'  
Primary adrenal insufficiency,"""Addison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. Up to 80 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome."" "
Polyendocrine deficiency syndrome,"'The polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II.''Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:'""Type II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:""'Scientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is ''inherited'' because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies. ' underactive parathyroid glands  slow sexual development  pernicious anemia  chronic candida infections  chronic active hepatitis  hair loss (in very rare cases)  an underactive thyroid gland  slow sexual development  diabetes  vitiligo  loss of pigment on areas of the skin "
Tuberculosis,"'Tuberculosis'' (''TB''), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at ''autopsy'' in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.' "
Other causes,"'Less common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are: ' chronic infection, mainly fungal infections  cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands  amyloidosis  surgical removal of the adrenal glands "
Secondary adrenal insufficiency,"""This form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as ""'prednisone'' for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''asthma'', or ''ulcerative colitis'', block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. '""Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. ""'Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from: ' tumors or infections of the area  loss of blood flow to the pituitary  radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors  surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus  surgical removal of the pituitary gland "
What are the signs and symptoms of Addison's disease?,"'The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency usually begin gradually. Characteristics of the disease are:''About 50 percent of the time, one will notice:''Other symptoms include:'""Addison's disease can cause irritability and ""'depression''. Because of salt loss, a craving for salty foods also is common. ''Hypoglycemia'', or ''low blood glucose'', is more severe in children than in adults.

It most commonly arises in the major and minor salivary glands of the head and neck. It can also occur in the breast, uterus, or other locations in the body. Symptoms depend on the ''tumor'""'s location. Salivary gland tumors may cause painless masses in the mouth or face. Tumors of the lacrimal gland may cause a bulging eye or changes in vision. Those affecting the windpipe or voice box may cause respiratory symptoms or changes in speech, respectively. Advanced tumors may cause ""'pain'' and/or nerve paralysis, as ACC often spreads along the nerves. It may also spread through the bloodstream. It spreads to the ''lymph nodes'' in about 5% to 10% of cases. The cause of ACC is currently unknown. It typically does not run in families. Treatment depends on many factors and may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Unfortunately, ACC is typically an aggressive form of cancer that has a poor long-term outlook.' "
Cause,"""The underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not yet known, but it appears to develop from non-inherited, genetic changes that occur during a person's lifetime. These genetic changes are present only in the cancer cells, not in the cells with the genetic material that is passed on to offspring (the egg and sperm cells). The changes may be caused by exposures in a person's environment. However, no strong environmental risk factors specific to ACC have been identified. Unlike some other ""'cancers'' of the head and neck'', ACC is not linked to tobacco or alcohol use, or infection by the human papilloma virus (''HPV'').''There has been evidence that ACC tumor cells are associated with the presence of too much of a protein called ""myb,"" and with the p53 tumor suppressor gene. This gene normally limits cell growth by monitoring the rate at which cells divide. Research is under way to better understand how ACC develops.' "
Inheritance,"'Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not considered to be an inherited cancer. Like most ''cancers'"", ACC appears to develop from genetic changes that are caused by something in a person's environment. In almost all reported cases, ACC has occurred sporadically in people with no family history of ACC. However, we are aware of two reports in the literature in which more than one family member had ACC. There has also been speculation about whether ACC may be associated with certain family cancer syndromes, but more research is needed to determine if an association exists."" "

Pediatric adenoidectomy,"'Your doctor has recommended an adenoidectomy for your child. The following information is provided to help you prepare for the surgery, and to help you understand more clearly the associated benefits, risks, and complications. You are encouraged to ask your doctor any questions that you feel necessary to help you better understand this procedure.''The adenoids are a mass of lymphoid tissue located behind the nasal passages. Adenoids may become infected and\xa0 remain enlarged or chronically infected, and subsequently lead to obstructed ''breathing'', ''snoring''/''sleep apnea'', sinus or ''ear infections'', or other problems. Adenoidectomy is a surgical procedure performed to remove the adenoids.''These instructions are designed to help your child (and you) recover from the adenoidectomy as easily as possible. Taking care of your child can prevent complications. Your doctor will be happy to answer any questions that you have regarding this material. If your child is having ear tube surgery (myringotomies and tympanostomy tubes placed) in conjunction with his/her adenoidectomy, please visit the following article for further information: Myringotomy.' "
What are risks and complications of adenoidectomy?,"""Your child's surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results. You have the right to be informed that the surgery may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, their anesthetic reactions, and their healing outcomes, ultimately there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications.""'The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this surgical procedure.'   Failure to resolve the ear or sinus infections, or relieve nasal drainage. 
 Bleeding. In very rare situations, the need for blood products or a blood transfusion. You have the right, should you choose, to have autologous (blood from yourself) or designated donor directed blood prepared in advance in case an emergency transfusion is necessary. You are encouraged to consult with your doctor if you are interested. 
 A permanent change in voice or nasal regurgitation (rare). 
 Need for further and more aggressive surgery such as sinus, nasal, or tonsil surgery. 
 Infection. 
 Failure to improve the nasal airway or resolve snoring, sleep apnea, or mouth breathing. 
 Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is neither a cure nor a substitute for good allergy control or treatment."
Before adenoidectomy surgery,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or the surgicenter. In both facilities, quality care is provided without the expense and inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will monitor your child throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist will call the night before surgery to review the medical history. If he/she is unable to reach you the night before surgery, he/she will talk with you that morning. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, you should arrange to have these done several days in advance.''Your child should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of your surgery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen''/''Advil'' or ''naproxen''/''Aleve'') should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory type ''drugs'"", so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, please call your doctor's office or consult your pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen''/''Tylenol'' is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Often, your doctor will give you several prescriptions for post-operative ''pain'' at the visit BEFORE the operation. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of your surgery.'""It is advised that you be honest and up front with your child as you explain his/her upcoming surgery. Encourage your child to think of this as something the doctor will do to make them healthier. Let them know they will be safe and that you will be close by. A calming and reassuring attitude will greatly ease your child's ""'anxiety''. You can assure them that most children have minimal ''pain'' following an adenoidectomy. Let them know that if they do have pain, it will only be for a short time, and that they can take medicines which will greatly reduce it.''Your child must not eat or drink anything 6 hours prior to their surgery time. This even includes water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''If your child is sick or has a ''fever'"" the day before surgery, call the doctor's office. If your child wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery. However, if your child has ""'chickenpox'', do not bring your child to the office or to the surgical facility.' "
The day of adenoidectomy surgery,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms with you, including the preoperative orders and history sheets. Your child is to wear comfortable loose fitting clothes (pajamas are OK). Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. He or she may bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket.' "
During adenoidectomy surgery,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of ''gas'' and an intravenous medication for the general anesthetic. In most situations, an IV will have been started either in the preoperative holding room or after the child has been given a mask anesthetic. During the procedure, your child will be continuously monitored by pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and ''heart'' rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is well trained and prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''After the anesthetic takes effect, the doctor will remove the adenoids through the mouth. There will be no external incisions. The base of the adenoids will be cauterized with an electrical cauterizing unit. The whole procedure usually takes less than 45 minutes. Your doctor will come to the waiting room to talk with you once your child is safely in the recovery room.' "
After adenoidectomy surgery,"'After surgery, your child will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor him/her. You will probably be invited into the recovery room as your child becomes aware of their surroundings and starts looking for you. Your child will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once he/she has fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours.''It is best for your child to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once they have recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though they may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to feed them slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, a child may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. However, if ''vomiting'' persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''They will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills or liquid that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic will also be prescribed (typically, acetaminophen/Tylenol with ''codeine''), and is to be taken as needed. If you have any questions or you feel that your child is developing a reaction to any of these medications, you should consult your doctor. You should not give any other medications, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless you have discussed it with your doctor.' "
Adenoidectomy surgery recovery,"'An appointment for a checkup should be made 10 to 14 days after the procedure. Call the office to schedule this appointment.''It is not unusual for children to have nasal stuffiness following surgery. The nasal stuffiness may last for several months as swelling decreases. Saline nose drops (Ocean Spray) can be used to help dissolve any clots and decrease ''edema''. You may notice persistent or even louder snoring for several weeks. A temporary change in voice is common following surgery, and will usually return to normal after several months. Your child, of course, will sound less ""nasal"" following surgery.''Bleeding is rare following an adenoidectomy. They may have some very light nasal bleeding. If it is minor, your doctor may advise the use of pediatric Neosynephrin nose drops. However, if it is persistent and bright red in color, call your doctor. On occasion, blood at the corner of the eye may be noticed.''Most patients require at least 7-10 days off from work or school. After 3 weeks, ''exercise'' and ''swimming'' can usually be resumed, but no diving for two months. You should plan to stay in town for 3 weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case you have bleeding.' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 degrees F which is persistent despite increasing the amount of fluid they drink, cool baths, and acetaminophen/Tylenol. A child with a fever should try to drink approximately one-half cup of fluid each waking hour. Persistent sharp pain or headache which is not relieved by the pain medication they were prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes."
What are the tonsils and adenoids?,"""The tonsils and adenoids are composed of tissues similar to the lymph nodes or glands found in the neck or other parts of the body. Together, they are part of a ring of glandular tissue (Waldeyer's ring) encircling the back of the throat.""'The tonsils and adenoids are part of the immune system thought to assist the body in its defense against incoming bacteria and viruses by helping the body form antibodies. However, this function may only be important during the first year of life. There is no evidence to support a significant role of the tonsils and adenoids in immunity. Medical studies have shown that children who have their tonsils and adenoids removed suffer no loss in their future immunity to disease or ability to ward off infections.' The tonsils are the two oval-shaped masses of tissue on either side of the back of the throat. Normal tonsils are usually about the same size and have the same pink color as the surrounding area. On their surfaces are little depressions, called crypts, which may appear deep and contain pus-filled pockets or tonsil stones. The adenoids are located high in the throat behind the nose and soft palate (the roof of the mouth) and unlike the tonsils, are not easily visible through the mouth. A tonsillectomy and an adenoidectomy (commonly referred to as a T & A) are surgical procedures performed to remove the tonsils and adenoids."
What are tonsillitis and adenoid infection symptoms a signs?,"'The most prominent symptom of tonsillitis and adenoid infection is a ''sore throat'' (''pharyngitis''). Other signs and symptoms of tonsillitis and adenoid infection include the following:''When there is a ''sore throat'' and coldsymptoms such as; congestion,\xa0runny nose, ''sneezing'', andcoughing,the cause is most likely a virus. Viral infection of the tonsils or adenoids usually resolves without treatment within two weeks.''Sore throat with a sudden mild fever, without symptoms of an ''upper respiratory tract infection'', may point to a bacterial infection called group A beta-hemolytic ''streptococcus'' (GABHS). If these symptoms are present, see a doctor for diagnosis because of the risk of ''strep throat''. Although ''strep throat'' will usually go away even without treatment, an untreated ''strep'' bacterial infection can lead to complications including ''rheumatic fever'', which can permanently damage the ''heart''.'""When there is a sore throat that does not affect the tonsils, medical professionals call this pharyngitis. When both the throat and the tonsils are affected, it's called pharyngotonsillitis.""   Fever Bad breath Congestion and runny nose Swollen lymph nodes in front of the neck Red, swollen tonsils with patches of pus (white spots) Painful swallowing (odynophagia) or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Loss of voice or muffled voice Headache Abdominal pain Coughing up blood With enlarged adenoids, breathing through the nose may be difficult and symptoms may include:Breathing through the mouth, especially in childrenNoisy breathing in the day; snoring at night is often observedNasal-sounding voice Breathing through the mouth, especially in children Noisy breathing in the day; snoring at night is often observed Nasal-sounding voice"
Is tonsillitis contagious?,"'Tonsillitis may or may not be ''contagious'', depending on the cause. If the cause is viral, it is usually contagious, but this depends upon whether or not a person has been exposed to that particular virus before. ''Mononucleosis'', a viral cause of sore throat, is contagious the first time a person comes in contact with the virus, usually in childhood or adolescence.''If the cause of the tonsillitis is bacterial, it is also contagious. For example, ''strep throat'' is highly contagious.''If the tonsillitis and enlarged adenoids are chronic or caused by a chronic condition, such as ''sinusitis'', ''hay fever'' or ''chronic rhinitis'', it likely is not contagious.' "
What causes tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'The most common problems occurring with the tonsils and adenoids are''Acute tonsillitis is an infection of the tonsils caused by one of several possible types of bacteria or viruses. Symptoms of acute tonsillitis can either come on suddenly, or be of a gradual onset of a sore throat usually accompanied by a fever.''Other signs and symptoms of acute tonsillitis include:''Strep'' throat is a specific type of infection caused by the ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. Strep tonsillitis can cause secondary damage to the heart valves (''rheumatic fever'') and kidneys (glomerulonephritis). It can also lead to a skin ''rash'' (for example, ''scarlet fever''), ''sinusitis'', ''pneumonia'', and ''ear infections''.''The ''Epstein-Barr virus'' causes acute mononucleosis and can lead to a very severe throat infection characterized by the rapid enlargement of the tonsils, adenoids, and lymph nodes of the neck. It also causes extreme malaise and ''tiredness''. The sore throat and gland swelling can last for one week to a month and does not respond to the usually prescribed antibiotics.''Chronic tonsillitis is a persistent infection of the tonsils. Repeated infections may cause the formation of small pockets (crypts) in the tonsils, which harbor bacteria. Frequently, small foul-smelling stones develop within these crypts. These stones (tonsilloliths) may contain high quantities of sulfa. When crushed, they give off the characteristic rotten egg smell, which causes bad breath. They may also give a patient the sense of something caught in the back of the throat.''A peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus around the tonsils that pushes one of the tonsils toward the uvula (the prominent soft tissue dangling from the back of the upper throat). It is generally very painful and is associated with decreased ability to open the mouth. If left untreated, the infection can spread deep in the neck causing life-threatening complications and ''airway'' obstruction.''Obstruction to breathing by enlarged tonsils and adenoids may cause snoring and disturbed ''sleep'' patterns that may lead to sleep pauses or ''sleep apnea''.''Other signs and symptoms include:''Some orthodontists believe chronic mouth breathing from large tonsils and adenoids causes improper alignment of the ''teeth'' (malocclusion).''Chronic enlargement and infection of the adenoids may lead to infection of the air passages around the nose (sinusitis) or nasal drainage/obstruction, and/or may affect the Eustachian tube of the ears, leading to chronic ''ear infections''.'   acute, recurrent, or chronic infections and significant enlargement (hypertrophy). Difficulty swallowing saliva Drooling Ear pain with swallowing Bad breath Tonsil surface may be bright red or have a grayish-white coating (exudate). Lymph nodes in the neck may be swollen. Fever Frequent awakening from sleep Restless sleep Nightmares Bedwetting Mood changes Excessive sleepiness Heart problems"
"What does tonsillitis look like 
(pictures)?", 
What tests diagnose tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'Physicians make a diagnosis of tonsillitis and adenoid infection based on a medical history and a physical exam.''If symptoms suggest strep throat, the doctor may order a throat culture or rapid strep test, which medical professionals perform by swabbing the back of the throat and checking for the ''Streptococcus'"" bacteria. This can be performed in the doctor's office. If a physician suspects the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause mononucleosis, as a cause for the tonsillitis, a blood test for mononucleosis may be done.""'Strep throat is more likely if at least three of the following signs or symptoms are present:''Antibiotic treatment may be needed if a bacteria caused the infection. In more severe, recurrent tonsillitis or adenoid infection, or in chronic cases, surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids (tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy) may be recommended to cure the condition.'   Fever White or yellow spots or coating on the throat and/or tonsils (tonsillar exudates) Red spots on the roof of the mouth (upper palette) Swollen or tender lymph nodes on the neck Absence of coughing or sneezing"
What OTC and antibiotic treatments cure tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'Various antibiotics treat bacterial infections of the tonsils and adenoids. Tonsillitis caused by the ''Streptococcus'' bacteria can lead to serious complications. Once treatment begins, it is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed because if you stop taking the ''drugs'' before they are finished it can lead to adverse consequences and regrowth of the bacteria. Physicians consider surgical removal in situations resistant to medical therapy or in frequently recurrent tonsillitis infections.''Medical professionals often treat viral causes of tonsillitis or enlarged adenoids with only supportive care (hydration and control of fever) and ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' medications. Do not give ''aspirin'"" to a child or teen unless directed by a doctor due to the risk of a condition called Reye's syndrome. Antibiotics are not effective for viral infection of the tonsils.""'A peritonsillar abscess should be drained either by removal of fluid with a needle and syringe (needle aspiration), cutting open with a scalpel (incision), or tonsillectomy. People can remove chronic stones in the tonsil with a clean finger or with a blunt probe. A long course of antibiotics may treat massive enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids causing airway obstruction, or even a brief course of steroids to reduce inflammation (cortisone-related medications, such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'').'  "
What natural home remedies help soothe tonsillitis pain and inflammation?,"'If a doctor has diagnosed tonsillitis, some home remedies can help soothe the symptoms of a sore throat.''Some alternative remedies may help ease tonsillitis symptoms.''Consult your doctor before using any alternative remedies. Doctors do not recommend many of these home remedies for use in children or adolescents as most have not been scientifically evaluated.' Throat sprays and lozenges: These can coat and moisturize the throat, and many have a topical anesthetic to relieve pain (consult a doctor before giving lozenges to young children; they can be a choking hazard) Saltwater gargle: This helps clear mucus from the throat Sipping warm beverages such as tea with honey, or broth can be soothing Eating cold foods such as ice cream or popsicles can help ease pain Slippery elm in lozenge form may help with pain relief Serrapeptase is an enzyme that has anti-inflammatory properties and can help decrease pain and help with swallowing Papain is an enzyme that can help treat inflammation Andrographis can help treat fever and sore throat symptoms"
When is surgery necessary for tonsilitis and/or adenoid infections?,"'Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are indicated in people with repeated or persistent infections, particularly if they interfere with everyday activities. The American Academy of Otolaryngology defines repeated infections in children as seven episodes in one year, or five episodes in each of two years, or three episodes in each of three years.''Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are also warranted in situations where there is enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids to such an extent that it causes severe ''sleep problems'' (snoring and breath holding), ''sleep apnea'', dental abnormalities, and difficulty swallowing. Adenoid enlargement alone, or in combination with tonsillar enlargement, can cause nasal obstruction, recurrent ''ear infections'', or sinusitis. If these conditions are resistant to medical therapy, surgery is indicated to cure them.''A significant episode of tonsillitis is defined by one or more of the following criteria: (1) a temperature greater than 101 F (38.3 C); (2) enlarged or tender neck lymph nodes; (3) pus material coating the tonsils; or (4) a positive strep test.''In adults, the severity, frequency, and hardship associated with repeated infections are considered more important than the absolute number. Chronic infections characterized by bad breath and/or tonsillar stones causing significant disability are also indicators for tonsillectomy.''Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are strongly considered in those patients who are suffering, or may suffer serious complications of infection. These include peritonsillar abscess, history of streptococcal complications (rheumatic ''heart disease'', glomerulonephritis), or neck abscess. Suspicion of ''cancer'' (''malignancy'') or ''tumor'' is a definite reason for surgery.'""It should be emphasized that all decisions for or against removing the tonsils or adenoids are dependent upon the individual patient's particular situation. Additional factors, such as tolerance of antibiotics, concurrent medical problems, school achievement/progress, and family preferences are also important factors in the decision process."" "
Which types of doctors treat tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"""A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child's pediatrician may diagnose and treat simple tonsillitis and adenoid infections. If your tonsillitis is severe enough that you go to an emergency department, you will be seen by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist. If infections are severe, chronic, or recurrent, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, also called an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist for further follow-up treatment or surgical removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids.' "
Exercise Stress Test Introduction,'A ''stress'' test can be used to test for ''heart disease''. ''Stress'' tests are tests performed by a doctor and/or trained technician to determine the amount of stress that your ''heart'' can manage before developing either an abnormal rhythm or evidence of ischemia (not enough blood flow to the heart muscle). The most commonly performed stress test is the ''exercise'' stress test.' 
What Is an Exercise Stress Test?,"'The ''exercise'' stress test -- also called a stress test, exercise ''electrocardiogram'', treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ''ECG'' -- is a test used to provide information about how the heart responds to exertion. It usually involves ''walking'' on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty, while your electrocardiogram, heart rate, and ''blood pressure'' are monitored.' "
Why Do I Need a Stress Test?,'Your doctor uses the stress test to:' Determine if there is adequate blood flow to your heart during increasing levels of activity. Evaluate the effectiveness of your heart medications to control angina and ischemia. Determine the likelihood of having coronary heart disease and the need for further evaluation. Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve blood flow within the heart vessels in people with coronary heart disease. Identify abnormal heart rhythms. Help you develop a safe exercise program.
What Types of Stress Tests Are There?,"'There are many different types of stress tests, including:''Preparation for these types of stress tests will vary from preparation for the exercise stress test. Ask your doctor about any specific instructions.' Dobutamine or Adenosine Stress Test: This test is used in people who are unable to exercise. A drug is given to make the heart respond as if the person were exercising. This way the doctor can still determine how the heart responds to stress, but no exercise is required. Stress echocardiogram: An 
echocardiogram (often called ""echo"") is a graphic outline of the heart's movement. A stress echo can accurately visualize the motion of the heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed; it may reveal a lack of blood flow that isn't always apparent on other heart tests. Nuclear stress test: This test helps to determine which parts of the heart are healthy and function normally and which are not. A very small and harmless amount of radioactive substance is injected into the patient. Then the doctor uses a special camera to identify the rays emitted from the substance within the body; this produces clear pictures of the heart tissue on a monitor. These pictures are done both at rest and after exercise. Using this technique, a less than normal amount of thallium will be seen in those areas of the heart that have a decreased blood supply."
How Should I Prepare for the Exercise Stress Test?," Do not eat or drink anything except water for four hours before the test. Do not drink or eat foods containing caffeine for 12 hours before the test. Caffeine will interfere with the results of your test. Do not take the following heart medications on the day of your test unless your doctor tells you otherwise, or if the medication is needed to treat chest discomfort the day of the test: Isosorbide dinitrate (for example, Isordil, Dilatrate SR); Isosorbide mononitrate (for example, ISMO, Imdur, Monoket); Nitroglycerin (for example, Deponit, Nitrostat, Nitro-bid). Your doctor may also ask you to stop taking other heart medications on the day of your test. If you have any questions about your medications, ask your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first talking with your doctor. If you use an inhaler for your breathing, please bring it to the test."
What If I have Diabetes?," If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor what amount of your medication you should take the day of the test. Often, you will take only half of your usual morning dose and eat a light meal 4 hours before the test. If you take pills to control your blood sugar, do not take your medication until after the test is complete. Do not take your diabetes medication and skip a meal before the test. If you own a glucose monitor, bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your exercise stress test. If you think that your blood sugar is low, tell the lab personnel immediately. Plan to eat and take your blood sugar medication following your stress test."
What Should I Wear the Day of the Test?,"'On the day of your stress test, wear soft-soled shoes suitable for walking and comfortable clothes. Do not bring valuables.' "
What Happens During the Exercise Stress Test?,"'First, during a stress test, a technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor (ECG or ''EKG'"") that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test.""'Before you start exercising, the technician will perform an EKG, to measure your heart rate at rest and will take your blood pressure.''You will begin to exercise by walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The rate of exercise, or degree of difficulty will gradually increase. You will be asked to exercise until you feel exhausted.''At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. Please tell them if you feel chest, arm or ''jaw pain'' or discomfort, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or any other unusual symptoms. It is normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and ''perspiration'' to increase during the test. The lab personnel will watch for any symptoms or changes on the ECG monitor that suggest the test should be stopped.''After the test you will walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal.''Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the actual exercise time is usually between seven and 12 minutes.''Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.' "
What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
What is an adenovirus?,"'Adenoviruses are common viruses that cause a variety of illnesses in humans. Most commonly, they cause respiratory tract infections or ''conjunctivitis'' (inflammation of the lining of the eyes). Adenoviruses are very hardy and can survive for long periods outside of a host human or animal. Both animals and human get adenovirus infections. Adenoviruses can infect different organs within the body, but most infections do not produce signs or symptoms (are asymptomatic).' "
"What are the types of adenovirus, and what illnesses do adenoviruses cause?","'There are 52 types of adenovirus that specialized blood tests can distinguish. These are serotypes. As discussed previously, most adenovirus infections do not cause symptoms or signs, and many infections that do produce symptoms only cause a mild illness. Serious infections, respiratory diseases, and illnesses are rare. Immunocompromised patients may be at greater risk.''Some of the illnesses that adenovirus serotypes can cause include the following:'  Common colds and sore throat Pinkeye (conjunctivitis) Bronchitis and bronchiolitis Pneumonia Diarrhea Bladder infections and urinary tract infections Gastrointestinal disease Neurologic disease, including encephalitis or meningitis (rare)"
How does the adenovirus spread?,"'There are several ways that an adenovirus infection spreads from person to person. Close contact with an infected person, such as touching, is a common way the infection spreads. It can also spread by droplets in the air when an infected person ''coughs'' or ''sneezes''. Since the virus can live outside the body, you can also get an adenovirus infection by touching a surface contaminated with the virus. Some kinds of adenovirus spread through the ''stool'' of an infected person (fecal-oral route), and contaminated water exposure, such as ''swimming'' pools, may transmit some types. People infected with an adenovirus may shed the virus even after their symptoms and signs disappear.' "
What are adenovirus infection symptoms and signs?,"'Virus-specific signs and symptoms depend on the exact illness caused by the virus (see above). Respiratory infections caused by adenovirus can cause ''runny nose'', congestion, ''sore throat'', ''fever'', or ''cough''. Symptoms and signs of pinkeye include ''redness of the eyes'', ''watering eyes'', and ''itching''. ''Diarrhea'', ''nausea'', or ''vomiting'' may result from an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Bladder infections can cause ''pain'' or ''burning with urination''.' "
What are adenovirus infection treatment options?,"'There are no ''drugs'' that are specific for adenoviral infections, and treatment of an adenovirus infection involves treating the symptoms and signs of the individual illness. Since most illnesses are mild and self-limited, often people do not require treatment from a healthcare provider.' "
Is it possible to prevent adenovirus infection? Is there an adenovirus vaccine?,"'You can take steps to help protect yourself from adenovirus infection, although it is likely not possible to completely prevent becoming infected by these common viruses. Avoiding contact with people who are ill, observing good handwashing and hygiene practices, and avoiding touching your nose, mouth, and eyes with unwashed hands can help prevent viral infections.''There is no adenoviral ''vaccine'' available for the public. A vaccine specific for adenovirus types 4 and 7 that are common causes of respiratory illness is available for use only in U.S. military recruits, who may be at higher risk for this infection.' "
Are there current outbreaks of adenovirus infection?,"'Adenoviral outbreaks can occur at any time of the year. In October 2018, an adenovirus outbreak was reported to cause the deaths of several ''children'' (currently, seven have died and 11 more are infected) in a nursing and rehabilitation center in New Jersey. Adenovirus type 7 caused this outbreak.' "
What is the definition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? ADD vs. ADHD,"'ADHD, formerly called ''ADD'', refers to a mental health condition called ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''. People with ADHD (formerly referred to as ADD) have problems with impulse control, excessive activity, and/or distractibility on a day-to-day basis. These symptoms are difficulties with what are known as executive functions, the brain functions that are best understood as being the boss or chief executive officer of brain. Examples of executive functioning include planning, prioritizing, organizing, disciplining, and controlling what the person does.''Statistics show that up to 7% of children and ''teens'' suffer from this disorder at any time, with up to 11% of children being assigned the diagnosis at some point during their childhood. Health professionals tend to diagnose boys with ADHD in children at a rate of more than twice that of girls. That is partly due to the diagnosis in girls being missed because of gender differences in ''ADHD symptoms''. There are also racial and ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment, in that Latino and African-American children are underdiagnosed with this diagnosis. Increasing access to care as well as family psychoeducation and culturally sensitive assessments of ADHD are important measures to alleviate those disparities. These measures combat implicit biases of people who are in the role of identifying possible mental health symptoms and referring for assessment (like teachers and pediatricians) so that ADHD symptoms are appropriately interpreted as potential illness rather than defiance or other intentional misbehavior.'""Children who are younger than their peers in the same class are at risk for being overdiagnosed with ADHD since mere months in age may make the difference in a child's ability to sit still, manage their impulses, and pay attention. Educating professionals, especially teachers, about these developmental differences is key to helping these children and their families.""  "
What are the types of ADHD (ADD)?,"'There are three presentations for ADHD:''The diagnostic label of ADHD has evolved over time. Difficulties paying attention were described by physician turned children\'s books author Heinrich Hoffmann in ""The Story of Fidgety Philip,"" a character who had trouble sitting still. While British pediatrician, Sir George Frederic Still, is credited with being the first to describe the whole group of symptoms for what is now known as ADHD, he viewed it to be caused by a problem with moral control. Earlier labels for this illness include hyperkinetic disease, hyperkinetic reaction of childhood, minimal ''brain damage'', and minimal brain dysfunction.''In 1980, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition'' (''DSM-III'') formally named ''attention deficit disorder'' (ADD), with or without ''hyperactivity'' (what is now referred to as ADHD). In 1987, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised'' (''DSM-III-R'') changed from having two subtypes of ADD, renaming the condition ''attention deficit'' hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Then in 1994, ''DSM-IV'' described ADHD as having the three subtypes of predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined types. That labeling was continued in the treatment revision of the manual (''DSM-IV-TR'') in 2000 and was minimally changed, to refer to predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentations, and combined presentation in the latest version of the manual, ''DSM-V'', in 2013.' Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive Predominantly inattentive Combined presentation (impulsive, inattentive, and hyperactive)"
Can a child in preschool have ADHD?,"'Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' estimate that about 2 million preschool-aged children are currently diagnosed with ADHD. While this condition can be diagnosed in children under 5 years of age, there is significant risk of misdiagnosis of ADHD given how quickly younger children grow and develop. Children who are of preschool age or younger also have less opportunity to be in settings that illuminate the symptoms of the condition than their school-aged counterparts. ''Symptoms of ADHD'' in toddlers may include problems with self-control, in that they experience trouble sitting still, a tendency to be in constant motion, talking constantly, as well as having difficulty focusing, listening, or settling down to ''sleep'' or eat.' "
What are risk factors and causes of ADHD in children?,"""Although there is no single cause for ADHD, there are a number of biological, environmental, and social factors that seem to increase the risk of a person developing the disorder. Brain imaging studies show that the brains of people with ADHD tend to be smaller. The connections between certain parts of the brain are fewer, and the brain's regulation of the neurochemical ""'dopamine'' tends to be less than in people who do not have the condition. Some medical conditions have been found to have a higher occurrence of ADHD compared to people without those conditions. Examples include ''seizures'', ''asthma'', as well as gastrointestinal disorders such as ''celiac disease'' and ''gluten'' sensitivity.''Risk factors for ADHD that can occur in the womb include maternal ''stress'', ''smoking'' or exposure to lead during ''pregnancy'', and low weight at birth. Being male and having a family history of ADHD increase the likelihood that an individual is diagnosed with ADHD. This illness has also been linked to being exposed to tobacco smoke at home (''secondhand smoke'') or lead during childhood.''Socially, low family income, low paternal education, exposure to childhood ''trauma'', or a sudden life change are risk factors for developing ADHD. Behavioral expectations based on the culture of an area, from a school district, town, state, or country can influence how often this diagnosis is made, as well.' "
What are childhood ADHD/ADD symptoms and signs?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), which is the gold standard of mental health diagnoses, symptoms of ADD/ADHD include the following:''The fact that children with ADHD may be able to highly focus on activities they enjoy (such as watching television or playing video games), even excessively, does not mean that they do not have the condition. The difference in attention of ADHD children is that they tend to have suboptimal memory, be less able to pay attention consistently, particularly when required to complete less pleasurable activities. Their trouble sitting still may involve engaging in behaviors like ''running'' or climbing in situations where it is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate. While symptoms like ''insomnia'', irritability, tantrums, otherwise quick temper or difficulty managing their anger, as well as low frustration tolerance, are not specific to ADHD or required for its diagnosis, many children, teens, and adults with this illness have these symptoms. Besides ''insomnia'', other ''sleep problems'' like ''sleep apnea'', low ''sleep'' efficiency, and trouble staying awake during the day often ''plague'' children who have ADHD .'   Often makes careless mistakes or has problems paying attention to detail Poor concentration during tasks or leisure activities Does not seem to be listening and appears to zone out when spoken to directly Frequently fails to complete instructions or to complete work tasks or chores Often has trouble organizing a task or activity Short attention span Frequently avoids, dislikes, or resists participating in activities that require sustained concentration/mental effort, due to difficulty focusing, a tendency to waste time Repeatedly loses things needed to complete tasks or activities Easily distracted by extraneous input or unrelated thoughts Frequent forgetfulness/absentmindedness Often engages in fidgeting, squirming, or tapping hands or feet Frequently has trouble staying seated Frequent restlessness or boredom Has trouble engaging in leisure activities quietly Engages in multiple activities at once Often talks excessively Repeatedly interrupts others talking Trouble waiting his or her turn Often intrudes on others"
How do health care professionals assess childhood ADHD? Are there ADD or ADHD tests? What types of doctors diagnose ADHD in children?,"'In order for a child to receive an ADHD diagnosis, he or she must exhibit six symptoms of ''inattention'' or six symptoms of combined hyperactivity and ''impulsivity'', while an older teen or adult need only have five of either group of symptoms. The ADD symptoms should start before 12 years of age, be present in more than one setting (for example, home and school), be severe enough to cause problems for the person, and not be able to be better explained by another condition for criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD to be met. There are three kinds of ADHD: predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and the combined (inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive) presentation.''Many health care professionals, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians and other primary care providers, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants, and social workers may help make the diagnosis of ADHD in children. One of these professionals will likely perform or refer for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of the assessment. One of the key issues in assessing children and teens for ADHD is determining whether the behaviors being exhibited are part of normal behavior for their age or of ADHD. Individuals with ADHD also often have a ''learning disability'' or one of a number of other mental health problems, like symptoms associated with exposure to trauma, as well as ''depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' and other ''anxiety'"" disorders, Asperger's syndrome, and other ""'autism''-spectrum disorders. Childhood ADHD is also often associated with other behavior disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Therefore, the health care professional will likely screen for signs of ''depression'', ''manic'' ''depression'', ''anxiety'"", and other mental health symptoms. The symptoms of ADHD may also be the result of a number of medical disorders that affect brain function or can be a side effect of various medications. For this reason, health care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of ADD symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, brain scan, or other imaging study may be needed. As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help establish the diagnosis. Some ADHD screening tests of symptom scales or checklists for children include the Vanderbilt Rating Scale and the Connors' Rating Scales.""""In an effort to encourage thoughtful, deliberate assessment and treatment of ADHD rather than premature treatment with medication, a stepped diagnostic approach to this condition is being encouraged by many mental health practitioners, except if the child's symptoms are severe such that the need for treatment is urgent. The steps in this approach include the following:""   Gathering information about the child from more than one source (such as from the school and home) Exploring what other issues may be causing symptoms (such as symptoms of a medical illness or reaction to trauma) Continue to monitor and assess potential symptoms over time If issues continue, provide an intervention like education materials on ADHD If the minimal intervention does not result in adequate symptom management, provide or refer for a brief number of counseling sessions to teach the child and his or her family ways to decrease and manage the child's symptoms and implement educational accommodations to help improve the child's educational performance. If issues continue despite the previous interventions, consider assessment for treatment with medication for ADHD."
What is the treatment for childhood ADHD or ADD? What are possible side effects of ADHD medications for children?,"'For people who have ADHD with ''celiac disease'' or gluten sensitivity, foods to avoid may include wheat-based products in an effort to decrease symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and distractibility. Although potentially difficult to implement in children, another change in the ''nutrition'' that may decrease symptoms includes eliminating food dyes. Limiting dietary ''sugar'' has seemed to decrease hyperactivity, impulsivity, or distractibility in some children, but research articles show inconsistent results in this regard. The Feingold ''diet'' (developed in the 1970s) involves omitting food additives in an attempt to alleviate ADHD symptoms. While the Feingold ''diet'' may help some individual children, it has long ago been deemed ineffective for most.''Dietary supplements'' are sometimes used as homeopathic treatments for ADHD. For example, ''fish oil'' (particularly in its prescription form [Vayarin]) has been found to effectively treat ADHD in some individuals, particularly for those who have mild symptoms. Positive effects of fish oil in the treatment of ADHD may take as long as three months to become apparent. Some herbs, both alone and in combination with other herbs, have been found to reduce ADHD symptoms in some people with the disorder. Examples of such herbs include ''ginkgo'' biloba, brahmi, green oats, and pine bark. Variations in the concentration of herbs from manufacturer to manufacturer can make using these treatments difficult to implement. ''Vitamins'' that are thought to improve thinking (B ''vitamins'') may also help improve the thinking and functioning of ADHD sufferers). Lifestyle improvements have been found to help reduce some symptoms in some children. Such improvements include regular ''exercise'' and ensuring the person receives adequate sleep every night. In fact, there is research that indicates that regular physical activity can measurably decrease ADHD symptoms, particularly in young children. Children who have trouble sleeping may benefit from ''over-the-counter'' medications that are not habit forming, such as ''melatonin''.''While medications are often prominent in the treatment of ADHD, there are a number of other evidence-based treatments without ''drugs'"". Psychoeducation for the ADHD sufferer and his or her loved ones can be invaluable in improving understanding about the challenges of this condition and ways to cope. Behavioral treatments that address parent-child interactions, as well as those that the child with ADHD has with his or her parents, peers, and in school are also important in improving the kid's ability to function. One such approach to behavioral therapy is Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). ABA uses a number of strategies for encouraging positive observable (as opposed to reported) behaviors and discouraging the continuation of negative observable behaviors by holding the individual accountable, establishing achievable goals, empowering the person's strengths, and maintaining an optimistic stance throughout the treatment process.""'Mental health professionals often work with parents through specialized ''parenting'"" skills trainings and/or through family therapy to enhance family structure and support, develop ways to manage a child's behaviors, promote the child's self-esteem, and to cope with any distress that the symptoms of ADHD causes within the family. Kids with ADHD, their parents, or other family members may also benefit from being part of a support group, in that such groups have the unique perspective of people who have similar experiences and can therefore give first hand advice on ways to cope.""""ADHD treatment specialists may assist teachers in developing ways to provide academic accommodations, thereby encouraging and reinforcing the child's strengths, decreasing the kid's counterproductive behaviors, and maximizing the child's academic success. Research shows that ADHD sufferers can also significantly improve their study skills, self-regulation, and feelings of well-being as the result of receiving ADHD coaching. This intervention is often designed to include weekly sessions, either in person, by telephone, or email over several months, often the length of the school year. The ADHD coach tends to focus on issues like scheduling homework, extracurricular and leisure activities, setting goals, organizing, confidence building, setting priorities, and persisting in getting things done. The coach will further provide emotional support, teach and encourage healthy social skills, positive self-image, self-discipline, and how to advocate for themselves. In order to encourage optimal investment of the child or adolescent in the ADHD coaching relationship, the goals and strategies primarily are guided by the person with ADHD rather than the coach.""""Mental health practitioners may enlist the child with ADHD in an anger management or social-skills training group of their peers to improve the child's ability to manage his or her emotions, as well as their success at making and keeping friends.""'Individual ''psychotherapy'' that uses a cognitive behavioral approach has been found to be an effective part of comprehensively treating ADHD. This method teaches time management, organization, and planning in an attempt to decrease the negative impact that distractibility, restlessness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity can have on the life of the ADHD sufferer. It also seeks to alleviate ways of thinking that encourage depression and ''anxiety''.''Children with ADHD often benefit from being prescribed medication, started at low doses followed by titration upward to the dose found to effectively treat each individual. The most common medications used to treat this disorder are the stimulant medications. Perhaps the oldest prescribed stimulant for the treatment of ADHD is ''Ritalin''. However, given the side effects associated with shorter-acting medications, as well as the longer days that older children and teens have compared to young children, ''stimulants'' that last longer are usually prescribed for those age groups. Examples of these prescribed drugs include long-acting preparations of ''methylphenidate'', like ''Daytrana'' patches, Quillivant-XR liquid, Ritalin-LA, ''Concerta'', and ''dexmethylphenidate'' (lisdexamfetamineVyvanse''Some children and adolescents may need to take a nonstimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. For those whose symptoms early in the morning or late in the evening (before the stimulant medication is taken or after it has worn off, respectively) are an issue, stimulants may not be the optimal medication treatment. For others, side effects like low appetite, stomach upset, ''insomnia'', ''tremors'', depression, loss of exuberance, irritability, less frequently tics, and rarely ''hallucinations'' may make it unwise for the child to take a stimulant medication. While stimulant treatment of people with ADHD who have no history of ''drug abuse'' tends to contribute to a decreased likelihood of developing a substance-abuse problem later on, those who have a recent history of ''alcohol'' or other ''drug abuse'' may make the small but real ''addiction'' potential of stimulants a reason not to prescribe a medication from that group. For children who either experience suboptimal effects, or significant stimulant medication side effects, non-stimulant medications like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'' or ''Kapvay''), or ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera'') may be considered. The prescription dietary supplement Vayarin has also been found to be effective in treating childhood ADHD.''Children who suffer from ADHD are at higher risk for developing mood problems during adulthood. They may therefore benefit from medications that have been found to be helpful for people who have both ADHD and depression or anxiety, like ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') or ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'').'  "
What are complications and the prognosis of ADHD in children?,"'Current estimates are that 85% of children receiving the diagnosis of ADHD are at risk for having the disorder in some form as an adult. About one-third of those children may seem to grow out of it; however, that does not occur for all symptoms. The remaining two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have most symptoms, but those symptoms may look differently in adulthood than in childhood. An example of that is the toddler, preschooler, or older child who has more trouble sitting compared to other children of the same age and gender still may grow up into an adult who gets bored easily. While there have been some well-founded concerns raised about the significant increase in how often ADHD is diagnosed, particularly in boys, treatment for children who truly qualify for the diagnosis is important in preventing the complications of this disorder in both childhood and adulthood.'""The lives of children with ADHD may be complicated by frequently getting in trouble and difficulty making and keeping friends since they can't focus, as well as due to having a lack of restraint, a tendency toward excitability and engaging in impulsive aggression. If untreated, these challenges can lead to school problems, social isolation, and tumultuous relationships with family members and other people.""'Adolescents and adults with ADHD may also develop significant co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and life problems, such as ''obesity'', borderline personality problems, legal problems, difficulty maintaining employment, ''substance abuse'', contracting sexually transmitted infections, and a significant risk for having depression and anxiety disorders. Fortunately, children who receive treatment for this condition tend to be less likely to develop many of the complications associated with ADHD.' "
Is it possible to prevent ADHD in children?,"'Studies indicate that ''breastfeeding'' up to 6 months of age may help protect individuals from developing ADHD. As environmental and social insults like maternal ''drug use'' and exposure to community violence, medical, and emotional issues are risk factors for developing ADHD, prevention or treatment of those issues can help prevent or decrease the severity of this condition.' "
What is the latest research on children with ADHD?,"'Much of the latest research on ADHD in children focuses on how exposure to environmental toxins may increase the risk of developing this condition. For example, studies indicate that exposure to fluoride, lead, pesticides, dry cleaning chemicals, and other chemicals can increase the likelihood that a child develops ADHD. ''Acupuncture'' is being explored as a possible treatment for this disorder. Also, research indicates that mothers who use ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') during pregnancy may be at higher risk of having a child with ADHD, particularly with more frequent use and during more than one trimester of the pregnancy.'

What is the definition of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? ADD vs. ADHD,"'ADHD, formerly called ''ADD'', refers to a mental health condition called ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''. People with ADHD (formerly referred to as ADD) have problems with impulse control, excessive activity, and/or distractibility on a day-to-day basis. These symptoms are difficulties with what are known as executive functions, the brain functions that are best understood as being the boss or chief executive officer of brain. Examples of executive functioning include planning, prioritizing, organizing, disciplining, and controlling what the person does.''Statistics show that up to 7% of children and ''teens'' suffer from this disorder at any time, with up to 11% of children being assigned the diagnosis at some point during their childhood. Health professionals tend to diagnose boys with ADHD in children at a rate of more than twice that of girls. That is partly due to the diagnosis in girls being missed because of gender differences in ''ADHD symptoms''. There are also racial and ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis and treatment, in that Latino and African-American children are underdiagnosed with this diagnosis. Increasing access to care as well as family psychoeducation and culturally sensitive assessments of ADHD are important measures to alleviate those disparities. These measures combat implicit biases of people who are in the role of identifying possible mental health symptoms and referring for assessment (like teachers and pediatricians) so that ADHD symptoms are appropriately interpreted as potential illness rather than defiance or other intentional misbehavior.'""Children who are younger than their peers in the same class are at risk for being overdiagnosed with ADHD since mere months in age may make the difference in a child's ability to sit still, manage their impulses, and pay attention. Educating professionals, especially teachers, about these developmental differences is key to helping these children and their families.""  "
What are the types of ADHD (ADD)?,"'There are three presentations for ADHD:''The diagnostic label of ADHD has evolved over time. Difficulties paying attention were described by physician turned children\'s books author Heinrich Hoffmann in ""The Story of Fidgety Philip,"" a character who had trouble sitting still. While British pediatrician, Sir George Frederic Still, is credited with being the first to describe the whole group of symptoms for what is now known as ADHD, he viewed it to be caused by a problem with moral control. Earlier labels for this illness include hyperkinetic disease, hyperkinetic reaction of childhood, minimal ''brain damage'', and minimal brain dysfunction.''In 1980, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition'' (''DSM-III'') formally named ''attention deficit disorder'' (ADD), with or without ''hyperactivity'' (what is now referred to as ADHD). In 1987, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised'' (''DSM-III-R'') changed from having two subtypes of ADD, renaming the condition ''attention deficit'' hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Then in 1994, ''DSM-IV'' described ADHD as having the three subtypes of predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined types. That labeling was continued in the treatment revision of the manual (''DSM-IV-TR'') in 2000 and was minimally changed, to refer to predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentations, and combined presentation in the latest version of the manual, ''DSM-V'', in 2013.' Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive Predominantly inattentive Combined presentation (impulsive, inattentive, and hyperactive)"
Can a child in preschool have ADHD?,"'Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' estimate that about 2 million preschool-aged children are currently diagnosed with ADHD. While this condition can be diagnosed in children under 5 years of age, there is significant risk of misdiagnosis of ADHD given how quickly younger children grow and develop. Children who are of preschool age or younger also have less opportunity to be in settings that illuminate the symptoms of the condition than their school-aged counterparts. ''Symptoms of ADHD'' in toddlers may include problems with self-control, in that they experience trouble sitting still, a tendency to be in constant motion, talking constantly, as well as having difficulty focusing, listening, or settling down to ''sleep'' or eat.' "
What are risk factors and causes of ADHD in children?,"""Although there is no single cause for ADHD, there are a number of biological, environmental, and social factors that seem to increase the risk of a person developing the disorder. Brain imaging studies show that the brains of people with ADHD tend to be smaller. The connections between certain parts of the brain are fewer, and the brain's regulation of the neurochemical ""'dopamine'' tends to be less than in people who do not have the condition. Some medical conditions have been found to have a higher occurrence of ADHD compared to people without those conditions. Examples include ''seizures'', ''asthma'', as well as gastrointestinal disorders such as ''celiac disease'' and ''gluten'' sensitivity.''Risk factors for ADHD that can occur in the womb include maternal ''stress'', ''smoking'' or exposure to lead during ''pregnancy'', and low weight at birth. Being male and having a family history of ADHD increase the likelihood that an individual is diagnosed with ADHD. This illness has also been linked to being exposed to tobacco smoke at home (''secondhand smoke'') or lead during childhood.''Socially, low family income, low paternal education, exposure to childhood ''trauma'', or a sudden life change are risk factors for developing ADHD. Behavioral expectations based on the culture of an area, from a school district, town, state, or country can influence how often this diagnosis is made, as well.' "
What are childhood ADHD/ADD symptoms and signs?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), which is the gold standard of mental health diagnoses, symptoms of ADD/ADHD include the following:''The fact that children with ADHD may be able to highly focus on activities they enjoy (such as watching television or playing video games), even excessively, does not mean that they do not have the condition. The difference in attention of ADHD children is that they tend to have suboptimal memory, be less able to pay attention consistently, particularly when required to complete less pleasurable activities. Their trouble sitting still may involve engaging in behaviors like ''running'' or climbing in situations where it is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate. While symptoms like ''insomnia'', irritability, tantrums, otherwise quick temper or difficulty managing their anger, as well as low frustration tolerance, are not specific to ADHD or required for its diagnosis, many children, teens, and adults with this illness have these symptoms. Besides ''insomnia'', other ''sleep problems'' like ''sleep apnea'', low ''sleep'' efficiency, and trouble staying awake during the day often ''plague'' children who have ADHD .'   Often makes careless mistakes or has problems paying attention to detail Poor concentration during tasks or leisure activities Does not seem to be listening and appears to zone out when spoken to directly Frequently fails to complete instructions or to complete work tasks or chores Often has trouble organizing a task or activity Short attention span Frequently avoids, dislikes, or resists participating in activities that require sustained concentration/mental effort, due to difficulty focusing, a tendency to waste time Repeatedly loses things needed to complete tasks or activities Easily distracted by extraneous input or unrelated thoughts Frequent forgetfulness/absentmindedness Often engages in fidgeting, squirming, or tapping hands or feet Frequently has trouble staying seated Frequent restlessness or boredom Has trouble engaging in leisure activities quietly Engages in multiple activities at once Often talks excessively Repeatedly interrupts others talking Trouble waiting his or her turn Often intrudes on others"
How do health care professionals assess childhood ADHD? Are there ADD or ADHD tests? What types of doctors diagnose ADHD in children?,"'In order for a child to receive an ADHD diagnosis, he or she must exhibit six symptoms of ''inattention'' or six symptoms of combined hyperactivity and ''impulsivity'', while an older teen or adult need only have five of either group of symptoms. The ADD symptoms should start before 12 years of age, be present in more than one setting (for example, home and school), be severe enough to cause problems for the person, and not be able to be better explained by another condition for criteria for the diagnosis of ADHD to be met. There are three kinds of ADHD: predominantly inattentive presentation, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and the combined (inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive) presentation.''Many health care professionals, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians and other primary care providers, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants, and social workers may help make the diagnosis of ADHD in children. One of these professionals will likely perform or refer for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of the assessment. One of the key issues in assessing children and teens for ADHD is determining whether the behaviors being exhibited are part of normal behavior for their age or of ADHD. Individuals with ADHD also often have a ''learning disability'' or one of a number of other mental health problems, like symptoms associated with exposure to trauma, as well as ''depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' and other ''anxiety'"" disorders, Asperger's syndrome, and other ""'autism''-spectrum disorders. Childhood ADHD is also often associated with other behavior disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Therefore, the health care professional will likely screen for signs of ''depression'', ''manic'' ''depression'', ''anxiety'"", and other mental health symptoms. The symptoms of ADHD may also be the result of a number of medical disorders that affect brain function or can be a side effect of various medications. For this reason, health care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of ADD symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, brain scan, or other imaging study may be needed. As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help establish the diagnosis. Some ADHD screening tests of symptom scales or checklists for children include the Vanderbilt Rating Scale and the Connors' Rating Scales.""""In an effort to encourage thoughtful, deliberate assessment and treatment of ADHD rather than premature treatment with medication, a stepped diagnostic approach to this condition is being encouraged by many mental health practitioners, except if the child's symptoms are severe such that the need for treatment is urgent. The steps in this approach include the following:""   Gathering information about the child from more than one source (such as from the school and home) Exploring what other issues may be causing symptoms (such as symptoms of a medical illness or reaction to trauma) Continue to monitor and assess potential symptoms over time If issues continue, provide an intervention like education materials on ADHD If the minimal intervention does not result in adequate symptom management, provide or refer for a brief number of counseling sessions to teach the child and his or her family ways to decrease and manage the child's symptoms and implement educational accommodations to help improve the child's educational performance. If issues continue despite the previous interventions, consider assessment for treatment with medication for ADHD."
What is the treatment for childhood ADHD or ADD? What are possible side effects of ADHD medications for children?,"'For people who have ADHD with ''celiac disease'' or gluten sensitivity, foods to avoid may include wheat-based products in an effort to decrease symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and distractibility. Although potentially difficult to implement in children, another change in the ''nutrition'' that may decrease symptoms includes eliminating food dyes. Limiting dietary ''sugar'' has seemed to decrease hyperactivity, impulsivity, or distractibility in some children, but research articles show inconsistent results in this regard. The Feingold ''diet'' (developed in the 1970s) involves omitting food additives in an attempt to alleviate ADHD symptoms. While the Feingold ''diet'' may help some individual children, it has long ago been deemed ineffective for most.''Dietary supplements'' are sometimes used as homeopathic treatments for ADHD. For example, ''fish oil'' (particularly in its prescription form [Vayarin]) has been found to effectively treat ADHD in some individuals, particularly for those who have mild symptoms. Positive effects of fish oil in the treatment of ADHD may take as long as three months to become apparent. Some herbs, both alone and in combination with other herbs, have been found to reduce ADHD symptoms in some people with the disorder. Examples of such herbs include ''ginkgo'' biloba, brahmi, green oats, and pine bark. Variations in the concentration of herbs from manufacturer to manufacturer can make using these treatments difficult to implement. ''Vitamins'' that are thought to improve thinking (B ''vitamins'') may also help improve the thinking and functioning of ADHD sufferers). Lifestyle improvements have been found to help reduce some symptoms in some children. Such improvements include regular ''exercise'' and ensuring the person receives adequate sleep every night. In fact, there is research that indicates that regular physical activity can measurably decrease ADHD symptoms, particularly in young children. Children who have trouble sleeping may benefit from ''over-the-counter'' medications that are not habit forming, such as ''melatonin''.''While medications are often prominent in the treatment of ADHD, there are a number of other evidence-based treatments without ''drugs'"". Psychoeducation for the ADHD sufferer and his or her loved ones can be invaluable in improving understanding about the challenges of this condition and ways to cope. Behavioral treatments that address parent-child interactions, as well as those that the child with ADHD has with his or her parents, peers, and in school are also important in improving the kid's ability to function. One such approach to behavioral therapy is Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA). ABA uses a number of strategies for encouraging positive observable (as opposed to reported) behaviors and discouraging the continuation of negative observable behaviors by holding the individual accountable, establishing achievable goals, empowering the person's strengths, and maintaining an optimistic stance throughout the treatment process.""'Mental health professionals often work with parents through specialized ''parenting'"" skills trainings and/or through family therapy to enhance family structure and support, develop ways to manage a child's behaviors, promote the child's self-esteem, and to cope with any distress that the symptoms of ADHD causes within the family. Kids with ADHD, their parents, or other family members may also benefit from being part of a support group, in that such groups have the unique perspective of people who have similar experiences and can therefore give first hand advice on ways to cope.""""ADHD treatment specialists may assist teachers in developing ways to provide academic accommodations, thereby encouraging and reinforcing the child's strengths, decreasing the kid's counterproductive behaviors, and maximizing the child's academic success. Research shows that ADHD sufferers can also significantly improve their study skills, self-regulation, and feelings of well-being as the result of receiving ADHD coaching. This intervention is often designed to include weekly sessions, either in person, by telephone, or email over several months, often the length of the school year. The ADHD coach tends to focus on issues like scheduling homework, extracurricular and leisure activities, setting goals, organizing, confidence building, setting priorities, and persisting in getting things done. The coach will further provide emotional support, teach and encourage healthy social skills, positive self-image, self-discipline, and how to advocate for themselves. In order to encourage optimal investment of the child or adolescent in the ADHD coaching relationship, the goals and strategies primarily are guided by the person with ADHD rather than the coach.""""Mental health practitioners may enlist the child with ADHD in an anger management or social-skills training group of their peers to improve the child's ability to manage his or her emotions, as well as their success at making and keeping friends.""'Individual ''psychotherapy'' that uses a cognitive behavioral approach has been found to be an effective part of comprehensively treating ADHD. This method teaches time management, organization, and planning in an attempt to decrease the negative impact that distractibility, restlessness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity can have on the life of the ADHD sufferer. It also seeks to alleviate ways of thinking that encourage depression and ''anxiety''.''Children with ADHD often benefit from being prescribed medication, started at low doses followed by titration upward to the dose found to effectively treat each individual. The most common medications used to treat this disorder are the stimulant medications. Perhaps the oldest prescribed stimulant for the treatment of ADHD is ''Ritalin''. However, given the side effects associated with shorter-acting medications, as well as the longer days that older children and teens have compared to young children, ''stimulants'' that last longer are usually prescribed for those age groups. Examples of these prescribed drugs include long-acting preparations of ''methylphenidate'', like ''Daytrana'' patches, Quillivant-XR liquid, Ritalin-LA, ''Concerta'', and ''dexmethylphenidate'' (lisdexamfetamineVyvanse''Some children and adolescents may need to take a nonstimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. For those whose symptoms early in the morning or late in the evening (before the stimulant medication is taken or after it has worn off, respectively) are an issue, stimulants may not be the optimal medication treatment. For others, side effects like low appetite, stomach upset, ''insomnia'', ''tremors'', depression, loss of exuberance, irritability, less frequently tics, and rarely ''hallucinations'' may make it unwise for the child to take a stimulant medication. While stimulant treatment of people with ADHD who have no history of ''drug abuse'' tends to contribute to a decreased likelihood of developing a substance-abuse problem later on, those who have a recent history of ''alcohol'' or other ''drug abuse'' may make the small but real ''addiction'' potential of stimulants a reason not to prescribe a medication from that group. For children who either experience suboptimal effects, or significant stimulant medication side effects, non-stimulant medications like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'' or ''Kapvay''), or ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera'') may be considered. The prescription dietary supplement Vayarin has also been found to be effective in treating childhood ADHD.''Children who suffer from ADHD are at higher risk for developing mood problems during adulthood. They may therefore benefit from medications that have been found to be helpful for people who have both ADHD and depression or anxiety, like ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') or ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'').'  "
What are complications and the prognosis of ADHD in children?,"'Current estimates are that 85% of children receiving the diagnosis of ADHD are at risk for having the disorder in some form as an adult. About one-third of those children may seem to grow out of it; however, that does not occur for all symptoms. The remaining two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have most symptoms, but those symptoms may look differently in adulthood than in childhood. An example of that is the toddler, preschooler, or older child who has more trouble sitting compared to other children of the same age and gender still may grow up into an adult who gets bored easily. While there have been some well-founded concerns raised about the significant increase in how often ADHD is diagnosed, particularly in boys, treatment for children who truly qualify for the diagnosis is important in preventing the complications of this disorder in both childhood and adulthood.'""The lives of children with ADHD may be complicated by frequently getting in trouble and difficulty making and keeping friends since they can't focus, as well as due to having a lack of restraint, a tendency toward excitability and engaging in impulsive aggression. If untreated, these challenges can lead to school problems, social isolation, and tumultuous relationships with family members and other people.""'Adolescents and adults with ADHD may also develop significant co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and life problems, such as ''obesity'', borderline personality problems, legal problems, difficulty maintaining employment, ''substance abuse'', contracting sexually transmitted infections, and a significant risk for having depression and anxiety disorders. Fortunately, children who receive treatment for this condition tend to be less likely to develop many of the complications associated with ADHD.' "
Is it possible to prevent ADHD in children?,"'Studies indicate that ''breastfeeding'' up to 6 months of age may help protect individuals from developing ADHD. As environmental and social insults like maternal ''drug use'' and exposure to community violence, medical, and emotional issues are risk factors for developing ADHD, prevention or treatment of those issues can help prevent or decrease the severity of this condition.' "
What is the latest research on children with ADHD?,"'Much of the latest research on ADHD in children focuses on how exposure to environmental toxins may increase the risk of developing this condition. For example, studies indicate that exposure to fluoride, lead, pesticides, dry cleaning chemicals, and other chemicals can increase the likelihood that a child develops ADHD. ''Acupuncture'' is being explored as a possible treatment for this disorder. Also, research indicates that mothers who use ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') during pregnancy may be at higher risk of having a child with ADHD, particularly with more frequent use and during more than one trimester of the pregnancy.'

What is teenage ADHD?," Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic disorders affecting school-age children. Current research indicates prevalence rates of 3%-5% with males being diagnosed with this disorder two and a half times more often than females. ADHD is described as ""a common neurobiologic disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity."" A more academic description is found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-V). This handbook of mental health disorders indicates that ADHD is characterized as ""a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals of comparable levels of development."" ADHD manifestations may be subdivided into three presentations:predominately inattentive,predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity, andcombined presentation. predominately inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined presentation. Originally thought to be ""outgrown"" by adulthood, current studies indicate that approximately 60%-80% of patients diagnosed as children will meet diagnostic criteria during adolescence and adulthood."
"What 
are risk factors and causes of ADHD in teens?","'ADHD is a disruption of neurocognitive functioning without a single cause. Current research is utilizing powerful neuroimaging techniques (for example, functional ''MRI'') and has developed intriguing hypotheses of neurochemical dysfunction of the brain as a cause of ADHD behaviors. Regions of the brain felt to be responsible for executive functioning, problem solving, as well as goal seeking and impulsivity may function differently in those individuals with ADHD when compared to those without the diagnosis. Interestingly, regions of the brain not felt to be associated with ADHD behaviors may also be different when individuals with ADHD are compared to people not experiencing ''ADHD symptoms''. While these theories may have interesting research implications, a more conventional approach utilizes both a mental-health evaluation and a thorough physical examination in determining the diagnosis of ADHD and providing a rational treatment program. There is clear evidence of a hereditary predisposition toward ADHD. ''Children with ADHD'' are more likely to have a parent or nonidentical twin sibling with the same diagnosis. An even higher likelihood exists when considering identical twins.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose ADHD in teens? Are there ADHD tests?,"'Primary to establishing a diagnosis of ADHD is the demonstration of symptoms detailed in the criteria of the ''DSM-V''. Collecting information from both parents and teachers is crucial. Various rating scales (for example, Connors Scales) are objective and efficient to complete. Part of the evaluation for an individual for possible ADHD involves a thorough search for other associated (but not causative) mental health disorders including (but not limited to) learning disorders, mood disorders, and more. By definition, it is crucial to exclude other causes of the ADHD symptom complex. This umbrella may include' adverse effects of medication, a medical problem (like hyperactive thyroid functioning), mental deficiency, and psychiatric disorders (for example, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder)."
What are the symptoms of ADHD in teens?,"'Several of the behaviors displayed in ''childhood ADHD'' carry through to the teen and even adult years. The manifestations may be more subtle and/or ""hidden"" due to the more mature coping mechanisms as well as the need to adapt to the expected behavior society demands with more advanced age. Studies have noted the following list of potential symptoms for adolescent ADHD patients:''Besides the obvious and expected academic and social problems these behaviors may engender, there is other ""fallout"" which may have even more severe consequences. These may include the following:'  Lack of focus: easy distractibility, overlooking details, not completing projects/assignments ""Hyperfocus"": intense focus that excludes similarly timed tasks or other individuals to the detriment of the ADHD sufferer Disorganization: procrastination, lateness, and difficult prioritizing Forgetfulness: may be misinterpreted as carelessness or lack of investment Impulsivity: interrupts conversations, performs socially inappropriate behaviors, and ignores consequences of acts Emotionalism: irritability and/or broad mood swings Poor self-image: may be hypercritical and hold self to unreasonably high standards Lack of motivation: coupled with procrastination and poor organizational skills leads to major problems at home, work, and school Physical and/or mental restlessness: taps toes, plays with pens/pencils, clears throat recurrently, and becomes bored easily Risk for car accidents: The combination of teenage invincibility that may be above and beyond their age/developmental-level peers, coupled with trouble focusing, impatience, excessive impulsivity, risk taking, and thrill-seeking behaviors underscore why ADHD teens are two to four more times likely to have an automobile accident than their non-ADHD affected peers. Alcohol consumption: Teens with ADHD are more likely to engage in drinking as well as drinking excessively. Several studies have documented that such teens are twice as likely to have consumed alcohol to excess (possibly leading to passing out) in the last six months compared to non-ADHD affected adolescents. Illicit drugs: Teens with ADHD are more likely to abuse drugs other than marijuana than teens not diagnosed with ADHD."
How does ADHD in teens affect executive function?,"'The frontal lobes of the brain are located directly behind the forehead and are not felt to be functionally fully mature until an individual is 22-25 years of age. A major role of this brain region is to provide executive function. While older teens generally do not have fully matured frontal lobes, adolescents with ADHD may carry an extra burden of less maturity of this region and thus have even more problems with executive function.''The basic task of executive function is to facilitate formulation and execution of a plan to achieve a goal. Executive function involves the ability to manage several tasks. These include time management, ignoring unnecessary (extraneous) information, switching focus from one task to another, prioritizing, planning and organizing tasks to achieve a goal, remembering details, controlling inappropriate speech and/or behaviors, and integrating past experiences with the current task at hand. Specialists in human behavior subdivide executive function into two elements:''An example of utilizing executive function might take place at dessert time in a restaurant. A large piece of ''chocolate'' cake is enticing, and the memory of prior pieces of chocolate cake provides a temptation (organization). However, remembering the excessive amount of calories the cake provides and your desire to lose 5 pounds enables you to skip dessert (regulation).''Teens with poorly managed executive function will commonly have problems with planning projects, memorizing information and integrating it into a subject area, estimating the time necessary to complete a project, and initiating and coordinating activities or tasks.' Organization: ""gathering information and structuring it for evaluation"" Regulation: ""taking stock of the environment and changing behavior in response to it"""
What kinds of difficulties do teens with ADHD face?,"'Teenagers with ADHD will commonly have problems with relationships (parents and peers), academic and nonacademic (for example, sports and employment) success, and self-esteem. It is important to include the teen when discussing management of his or her ADHD. Accepting the diagnosis of ADHD can be a major hurdle. A teen\'s sense of self-identity requires fitting in seamlessly with peers; this goal of blending in may be disrupted and the adolescent may feel that he or she has been ""labeled"" and thus ostracized. Helping the teen to appreciate his or her strengths and that there are options which will help to ""level the playing field"" will actually enable him or her to better fit in with their non-ADHD affected peers. The analogy of wearing glasses may help to make the point. The glasses merely enable the wearer to see as well as those whose vision is not impacted. Management of ADHD is merely designed to return the teen back to the baseline his or her contemporaries currently experience.' "
What are nonmedical treatment strategies for teen ADHD?,"'Nonmedical management strategies for the adolescent with ADHD include the following:'  Provide fair, clear, and consistent expectations, direction, and limits. Follow a regular (while not rigid) schedule and limit distractions. Establish a system of rewards and consequences to address the teen's behavior. Boost the teen's self-esteem by acknowledging success and positive behavioral choices. Create a home system to help the teen stay on schedule for both immediate- and more long-term academic projects. Establish a positive relationship with teachers so that regular, timely, bidirectional feedback occurs on a regular basis. Try to stay calm during the inevitable disagreements between you and your adolescent. Seek professional help if conflicts seem extreme. Encourage one hour of vigorous physical activity prior to starting homework. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated a positive relationship between vigorous physical activity and faster and more effective and accurate study habits. Establish regular, quality sleep patterns. Set firm, fair, consistent rules for the use of TV, computers, Internet, texting, cell phone usage, and video games. Find activities in which the child can be successful (for example, sports, hobbies, etc.)."
What stimulant medications are available to treat ADHD in teens?,"'Several studies have clearly established that pharmacologic (drug) therapy for ADHD is superior to behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. Combining medication and behavioral therapy is less likely to improve behavioral outcomes over medication alone unless patients are also experiencing ''anxiety'' or oppositional defiant disorder. The first category of therapeutic medications is chemically classified as ""''stimulants''."" Studies have established that 80% of patients with ADHD will have a positive response to their use and this therapy is generally well tolerated. Medications come in short- (three to four hour), medium- (five to six hour), and long-lasting (eight to 14 hour) formulations. The two most common medications are''Stimulant medications that are in liquid (Quillivant-XR and Dyanavel) or in patch form (''Daytrana'') are now available, allowing children who have ''difficulty swallowing'' pills to benefit from medication. Both the methylphenidate and amphetamine classes of stimulants are felt to positively affect the neurochemical transmitters of the brain that moderate attention, arousal, and impulse control.'  methylphenidate (for example, Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin, Metadate) and amphetamine (for example, Adderall, Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Mydayis)."
What are the potential side effects of stimulant medications for teens with ADHD?,"'Side effects may include appetite suppression, irritability, inhibited personality, ''depression'', and ''sleep'' issues. Rarely, patients may develop tics and very rarely patients develop ''hallucinations'' while taking stimulant medications. Studies show that short-term use of stimulants (up to three years) may contribute to a mild slowing of the rate of height acquisition; however, the ultimate acquired height when considering long-term use is not thought to be affected. Recently, there have been concerns regarding the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients treated with stimulants. A recent policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that several elements be evaluated prior to initiating therapy with stimulant medications.''A growing concern in high school and college involves students selling their stimulant medication to non-ADHD peers. These students harbor the false belief that taking such medication will boost their study skills and thus boost their academic performance.' Patient and family cardiac history of structural or functional heart disease, sudden death, unexplained death in children through young adults, and history of hereditary heart disease (cardiomyopathy and/or long QT syndrome): Concerns of these issues warrant evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. Routine EKG or echocardiogram studies are not thought to be necessary for most patients."
What non-stimulant medications are available to treat ADHD in teens?,"'Non-stimulant medications are generally considered to be second line in the treatment of ADHD. They are generally found to be more subtle in their effectiveness compared to stimulant-class medications. One of the primary non-stimulant medications prescribed is ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera''). Other non-stimulant medications that have been found to be helpful in treating ADHD include those that are also used as cardiac medications like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv'') and ''clonidine'' (''Kapvay'').''A disadvantage to such medications is that they may take up to six weeks for atomoxetine and one to four weeks for guanfacine and clonidine to achieve an effective dosage. As a consequence, taking ""drug holidays"" (for example, winter break) is not as feasible as it is when a patient is utilizing a member of the stimulant class of medications. Side effects of atomoxetine may include ''decreased appetite'', ''upset stomach'', and sleepiness. Side effects of guanfacine and clonidine may include sleepiness, ''dizziness'', ''low blood pressure'' when taking the medication, and ''high blood pressure'' if the medication is stopped abruptly. In 2005, the FDA published a ""black box"" warning for atomoxetine and the risk for ''suicidal thoughts'' or attempts, especially in adolescents.''Pediatric behavior specialists may consider the use of ''antidepressants'' for ADHD patients who experience unreasonable side effects, do not effectively respond to stimulant/non-stimulant medications, or in those who also suffer from significant ''depression'' or anxiety.' "
What alternative treatments are available for ADHD in teens?,"'Parents and patients often question the value of ""alternative"" (nondrug or non-''psychotherapy'') treatments to manage ADHD symptoms. A recent review has drawn the following conclusions:' There is currently no proof that a diet high in sugar contributes to ADHD behaviors. The Feingold diet attempts to eliminate artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives in an attempt to affect hyperactivity. No documented benefit has been demonstrated in quality studies and inflicting restrictive food choices on children and adolescents can prove to be problematic and cause unnecessary conflicts. Interactive metronome training trains the patient to mimic foot and hand tapping synchronized with a metronome. The theory is that ADHD symptoms are deficits in motor planning and that interactive metronome therapy promotes the ability to focus for extended periods of time, filter out distractions, and develop self-management of ADHD symptoms. A few studies have shown a positive benefit for this program in boys between 6-12 years of age in terms of visual motor control and less so with sustained attention or hyperactivity. Further research in this field is ongoing. Some chiropractors propose that muscle tone imbalances are causative for ADHD behaviors and that spinal adjustments are beneficial. To date, no scientifically rigorous study has confirmed this belief. Studies have shown that some patients with ADHD have a unique pattern of brain waves when studied by EEG. Neurofeedback techniques propose that a patient may be trained to eliminate these abnormal EEG patterns and thus modify their behaviors. While there are some promising results, concern regarding the high cost and duration of therapy exist. Several recent studies have explored the possible beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (for example, Vayarin). Some results indicate that there may be a small subset of patients with ADHD that may experience an improvement in symptoms of inattention. Studies are now ongoing to confirm this observation and attempt to predictably determine those individuals who may benefit from such supplements. Other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches have been tried but have not scientifically been demonstrated as helpful. These include megavitamin therapy, herbal and medicinal supplements (for example, St. John's wort), neurofeedback/biofeedback, and chelation therapy. Several studies involving St. John's wort and chelation therapy have been demonstrated to risk major side effects."
What is a frozen shoulder?,'A frozen shoulder is a shoulder joint with significant loss of its range of motion in all directions. The range of motion is limited not only when the patient attempts motion but also when the doctor attempts to move the joint fully while the patient relaxes. A frozen shoulder is medically referred to as adhesive capsulitis.' 
What causes a frozen shoulder?,"'Frozen shoulder is the result of inflammation, scarring, thickening, and shrinkage of the capsule that surrounds the normal shoulder joint. Any shoulder injury can lead to a frozen shoulder, including tendinitis, ''bursitis'', and ''rotator cuff injury'' (''rotator cuff'' syndrome). Adhesive capsulitis occurs more frequently in patients with risk factors of ''diabetes'', chronic inflammatory ''arthritis'' of the shoulder, or after chest or breast surgery. Long-term immobility of the shoulder joint can put people at risk to develop a frozen shoulder.'  "
What are symptoms and signs of a frozen shoulder?,"'Symptoms and signs of a frozen shoulder include ''shoulder pain'', stiffness, and loss of range of shoulder motion. The shoulder range of motion is limited when either the patient or an examiner attempts to move the joint. The shoulder can develop increased ''pain'' with use. These symptoms can make ''sleep'' very uncomfortable.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a frozen shoulder?,"'A frozen shoulder is suggested during examination when the shoulder range of motion is significantly limited, with either the patient or the examiner attempting the movement. Underlying diseases involving the shoulder can be diagnosed with the history, examination, blood testing, and X-ray examination of the shoulder.''If necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed when an X-ray contrast dye is injected into the shoulder joint to demonstrate the characteristic shrunken shoulder capsule of a frozen shoulder. This X-ray test is called arthrography. The tissues of the shoulder can also be evaluated with an ''MRI'' scan.' "
What conditions can mimic adhesive capsulitis?,"'Inflammation of the shoulder joint (arthritis) or the muscles around the shoulder and ''degenerative arthritis'' of the shoulder joint can cause swelling, pain, or stiffness of the joint that can mimic the range of motion limitation of a frozen shoulder.''Injury to individual tendons around the shoulder (tendons of the ''rotator cuff'') can limit shoulder-joint range of motion but usually not in all directions. Often during the examination of a shoulder with tendon injury (tendinitis or tendon tear), the doctor is able to move the joint with the patient relaxed beyond the range that the patient can on their own.' "
What is the treatment for a frozen shoulder?,"'The treatment of a frozen shoulder usually requires an aggressive combination of ''over-the-counter'' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, ''cortisone injection''(s) into the shoulder, and physical therapy (physiotherapy). Without aggressive treatment, adhesive capsulitis can be permanent.''Diligent physical therapy is often essential for recovery. A physical therapist will administer ''ultrasound'', electric stimulation, range-of-motion ''exercise'' maneuvers, stretching, ice packs, and eventually strengthening exercises. Physical therapy can take weeks to months for recovery, depending on the severity of the scarring of the tissues around the shoulder.''It is very important for people with a frozen shoulder to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. These individuals should avoid sudden, jerking motions of or heavy lifting with the affected shoulder.''Sometimes a frozen shoulders is resistant to treatment. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the ''scar tissue'' by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. This manipulation is performed to physically break up the ''scar'' tissue of the joint capsule. It carries the risk of breaking the arm bone (humerus ''fracture''). It is very important for patients that undergo manipulation to partake in an active ''exercise'' program for the shoulder after the procedure. It is only with continued exercise of the shoulder that mobility and function is optimized.'  "
What is the prognosis of a frozen shoulder?,"'The prognosis of a frozen shoulder depends on its response to physical therapy, exercises, and treatments as described above. Again, it is essential to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the scar tissue by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. Without aggressive treatment, a frozen shoulder can be permanent.'  "
Is it possible to prevent a frozen shoulder?,'Prevention'' of a frozen shoulder involves avoiding injury or reinjury to the shoulder.' 
What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?,"'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'', often called ADHD or ''ADD'' (''attention deficit disorder''), is a behavioral condition that is characterized by symptoms of distractibility, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. This disorder often results in a man or woman having relationship problems, as well as difficulty performing well at work or in their community.' "
How prevalent is adult ADHD?,"'Although it is estimated that 2%-6% of adults have ADHD, this illness begins during childhood. While the condition is assessed more often in boys than in girls, it appears to occur in men and women at equal rates. Nearly two-thirds of ''children with ADHD'' retain some symptoms of the illness as adults, and about half have just as many symptoms of sufficient severity to still qualify for the diagnosis of ADHD. Other key statistics include that more than 90% of adults with the condition describe having trouble focusing, and more than 50% have both distractibility and hyperactivity/impulsivity, while more than one-third have just distractibility.' "
What are causes and risk factors for adult ADHD?,"'While there is no one specific cause for ADHD, there are a number of biologically and socially based risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person developing the illness. Children with ADHD are more likely to grow into teens and adults with the condition. Brain-imaging studies indicate that traits of the brains of people who have ADHD include a tendency to be smaller, to have less connection between certain areas of the brain, and have less regulation of the neurochemical ''dopamine'' compared to people who do not have the disorder.''In addition to being risk factors for other neuropsychological issues, factors prior to birth that can increase the likelihood of developing ADHD include maternal ''stress'', ''smoking during pregnancy'"", prematurity and low birth weight, as well as an early life stressor in the individual with ADHD. Males and having a family history of this disorder increase the chances that a person will be diagnosed with ADHD. Low family income and low educational achievement for a person's father are social risk factors for developing ADHD."" "
What are adult ADHD symptoms and signs?,"'What is thought to be partly the result of maturity, adults with ADHD may show little to no signs of hyperactivity or the hyperactivity may look more like restlessness and a tendency to become bored easily. For those who do, symptoms and signs of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention may resemble those that are exhibited by children and teens. However, how those symptoms are exhibited tends to vary with age. ''Symptoms of ADHD'' include the following:''While the excessive focus, often described as hyperfocus, is not included as a formal symptom of ADHD, it is often described by people who suffer from this condition or their family members. This symptom is thought by many to be a manifestation of the ineffective focus that is associated with this condition.'   Often makes careless mistakes or pays inadequate attention to detail Trouble focusing during work or leisure activities Does not appear to be listening when spoken to directly Is often unable to complete directions, work tasks, or chores Frequently disorganized when trying to complete a task or activity Has a tendency to avoid, dislike, or resist (procrastinate) engaging in activities that require sustained attention Often loses things that are necessary to complete tasks or activities Easily distracted by extraneous or unrelated stimuli Frequent forgetfulness Frequently fidgety or moves hands or feet Frequently has trouble remaining seated Has a tendency to feel restless Has difficulty participating in leisure activities quietly Performs multiple activities at once Excessive talking Often interrupts others talking Trouble waiting for his or her turn Frequently intrudes on other people Often does something without thinking about it first (behavioral impulsiveness)"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose adult ADHD?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V''), in order to be diagnosed with ADHD, a child should exhibit six symptoms of inattention or six symptoms of combined hyperactivity and impulsivity, and an older teen or adult need only demonstrate five of each group of symptoms. Diagnostic criteria further state that symptoms should begin prior to 12 years of age, occur in more than one setting (like home and work), be significant enough to cause difficulties for the person, and not be able to be better explained by another illness. There are three types of ADHD: predominately inattentive presentation, predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and the combined (inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive) presentation.'""Many health care professionals, like psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health physician's assistants and nurse practitioners, may help diagnose ADHD. A professional will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical exam as part of the evaluation. Since ADHD can be associated with other mental health conditions, like ""'depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', ''obsessive compulsive disorder'', and other ''anxiety'' disorders, as well as with ''autism''-spectrum disorders, the evaluator will likely screen for signs of those and other forms of ''mental illness''. The signs and symptoms of ''adult ADHD'"" may also be caused by many medical conditions or can be a side effect of a number of medications. Therefore, blood tests are frequently done as part of the initial assessment. Occasionally, an imaging study like an X-ray or CAT scan may be necessary. As part of the evaluation, the individual may be asked questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to assist in determining the diagnosis. Some ADHD symptom checklists for children have been adapted to screen for the condition in adults. Examples of such diagnostic tools include the Conners' ""'Adult ADHD'' Rating Scale (CAARS) and the Adult Self Report Scale.'  "
What is the treatment for adult ADHD? What are adult ADHD medications?,"'Treatments for ADHD in adults that do not involve medication include education about the illness, participation in an ADHD support group, and instructional training for a number of issues, including career counseling, organizational skills building, parent counseling, financial training, and development of time-management skills. Many people with this condition may benefit from cognitive ''behavior therapy'', a form of ''psychotherapy'' that seeks to help the individual alter patterns of thinking that may interfere with their functioning.''As with the treatment of ''ADHD in children'', adults often benefit from being treated with a stimulant medication. Commonly, the first prescribed stimulant for the treatment of this condition in children is a derivative of ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') or ''dextroamphetamine'' (''Dexedrine''). Given the longer days and increased responsibilities that adolescents and adults have compared to young children, longer-acting ''stimulants'' are usually prescribed. Examples of those medications include long-acting methylphenidate, like ''Daytrana'' patches, ''Concerta'', ''Quillivant XR'', and ''dexmethylphenidate'' (''Focalin''-XR), as well as the long-acting amphetamine salt ''narcolepsy''Adults whose symptoms early in the morning or late in the evening are an issue, or whom have a history or propensity to a ''drug use disorder'', stimulants may not be the optimal medication treatment and, therefore, they may respond better to a nonstimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. Side effects like low appetite, trouble sleeping, ''tremors'', emotional inhibition, irritability or ''depression'', less frequently ''tics'', and rarely ''hallucinations'' may make taking a stimulant medication unwise. Using a stimulant to treat ADHD in people who have no history of ''drug abuse'' tends to decrease the likelihood of their ever developing a ''substance abuse'' problem. However, people with a recent history of ''alcohol'' or other ''drug abuse'' may want to avoid the small but possible ''addiction'' potential of stimulant medication. The long-term impact of addiction to a stimulant may be serious, potentially resulting in having a ''stroke'' or ''heart attack''. Individuals who either had less-than-optimal effects or had significant side effects to taking stimulants may respond better to a nonstimulant medication like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'' or ''Kapvay''), or ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera''), or to taking the prescription supplement phosphatidylserine-''omega-3'' (Vayarin), which has a specialized delivery system compared to ''over-the-counter'' preparations of the omega-3 supplement.''People with ADHD are more likely to develop mood problems as adults. They therefore may benefit from medications like ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') or ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') that treat both ADHD and ''depression'' or ''anxiety''.'

Are there any home remedies for adult ADHD?,'Further research is needed to determine the potential effectiveness of natural remedies for treating adult ADHD. Examples of such remedies include dietary restrictions and vitamin ''supplements''. The limited research available on the effectiveness of these remedies does not usually include studies on adults.''Lifestyle changes that have been found to be useful in reducing some symptoms of ADHD in children and may be considered for adults include regular ''exercise'' and improving ''sleep'' every night.' 
What are complications of adult ADHD?,"'Adults living with ADHD are more likely to have low self-esteem, ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and are not as adaptive with their social abilities compared to adults without the illness. The presence of other mental health disorders (co-morbidity) is more likely in adults who are hyperactive and/or impulsive as opposed to being distractible as part of ADHD. Adults with this condition are also more at risk for underachievement in school or at work, being in more car accidents, using tobacco products or other ''drugs'', having problems managing their anger, and are more likely to develop antisocial behaviors, particularly if not treated. Given the cost effectiveness of treating ADHD and the potentially dire consequences of this illness going undiagnosed and untreated, the importance of identifying ADHD is clear.''ADHD adults tend to have more marital problems, as well as troubles getting along with peers and authority figures. They may, therefore, become isolated socially.''Adults with ADHD are at risk for completing fewer years of education compared to their non-ADHD counterparts. They are often more interested in careers for which forgetfulness is less of an obstacle for good performance, as well as those that provide immediate gratification and other forms of excitement, like sales. They are often at risk for procrastinating on tasks, frequently changing jobs, and losing more jobs.' "
What is the prognosis of adult ADHD?,"'The prognosis for ADHD adults seems to be influenced by the severity of symptoms, scores on intelligence tests, whether the person with the condition has other mental health problems, as well as if there are family issues, such as parental mental health problems, family problems, socioeconomic challenges, and if the individual with ADHD receives treatment. Studies show that stimulant treatment of this condition often improves the prognosis for adults, decreasing the risk for developing other psychiatric problems, failing in school and in the world of work.' "
Is it possible to prevent adult ADHD?,"'Research indicates that ''breastfeeding'' up to 6 months of age may help prevent the development of ADHD. Since environmental and social problems like ''drug use'' in the mother, medical, and emotional challenges increase the likelihood of developing this condition, ''prevention'"" or treatment of those issues can help prevent ADHD. In addition, early treatment of children with ADHD can decrease the impact the illness has on the individual's life into adulthood."" "

What functions do the different parts of the brain control?,"'The brain has three major parts:''The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body.''The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.' The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement. The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture. The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat."
What is brain tumor? What is a spinal cord tumor?,"'An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord.''There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS).''The tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer):''When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment.''Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults.' Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back). Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue."
Signs and symptoms of brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'The signs and symptoms of adult brain and spinal cord tumors are not the same in every person.''Signs and symptoms depend on the following:''Signs and symptoms may be caused by CNS tumors or by other conditions, including cancer that has spread to the brain. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Where the tumor forms in the brain or spinal cord. What the affected part of the brain controls. The size of the tumor. Morning headache or headache that goes away after vomiting. Seizures. Vision, hearing, and speech problems. Loss of appetite. Frequent nausea and vomiting. Changes in personality, mood, ability to focus, or behavior. Loss of balance and trouble walking. Weakness. Unusual sleepiness or change in activity level. Back pain or pain that spreads from the back towards the arms or legs. A change in bowel habits or trouble urinating. Weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. Trouble walking."
Metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.''Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.''Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from ''lung cancer''. Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include:''Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include:' Melanoma Breast cancer Colon cancer Kidney cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer Cancer of unknown primary site Breast cancer Lung cancer Leukemia Lymphoma"
WHO Tumor Grading System," Grade I (low-grade) — The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery. Grade II - The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor. Grade III - The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue. Grade IV (high-grade) - The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured."
Genetic syndromes and risks,"'Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors:''The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known.' Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, having AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information.) Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2)von Hippel-Lindau diseaseTuberous sclerosisLi-Fraumeni syndromeTurcot syndrome type 1 or 2Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2) von Hippel-Lindau disease Tuberous sclerosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2 Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome"
Types of brain tumors in adults,"'An astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. Astrocytic tumors include:''An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following:''A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it — oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma.''An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid-filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following:''A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults.''A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following:''A meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following:''A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.''A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant.''A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the ''pituitary gland'' (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells.' Brain stem glioma (usually high grade): A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. Pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle. Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I): A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured. Diffuse astrocytoma (grade II): A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma. Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma. Glioblastoma (grade IV): A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. It is also called glioblastoma multiforme. Oligodendroglioma (grade II): An oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III): An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. Oligoastrocytoma (grade II): An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured. Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade II). Ependymoma (grade I or II): A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. There are two types of grade I ependymoma - myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. In some cases, a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured. Anaplastic ependymoma (grade III): An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma. Pineocytoma (grade II): A pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor. Pineoblastoma (grade IV): A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread. Meningioma (grade I): A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the dura mater. A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery. Meningioma (grade II and III): This is a rare meningeal tumor. It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery."
How are brain and spinal cord tumors diagnosed?,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Neurological exam: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. Visual field exam: An exam to check a person’s field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight. Tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor. Gene testing: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor. This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up. SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body."
Brain and spinal cord biopsy,"'The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.''The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:''For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.''Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done.' Stereotactic biopsy: When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Open biopsy: When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain. Immunohistochemistry: A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. Light and electron microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells. Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes."
What are the treatment options for brain and spinal cord tumors in adults?,"'Five types of standard treatment are used to treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors.''Active surveillance is closely watching a patient’s condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. Active surveillance may be used for very slow-growing tumors that do not cause symptoms.''Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain. See the General Information section of this summary.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include:''Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.''Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. To treat brain tumors, a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain.''Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells there. This is called ''intrathecal chemotherapy''.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.''Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.''Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.''Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors.''Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.''This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life. For brain tumors, supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain.'  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. Stereotactic radiosurgery: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery."
New types of clinical trial treatments for brain and spinal cord tumors in adults,"'This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied.''Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.''Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called ''biotherapy'' or immunotherapy.''Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include:''Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.''For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' Dendritic cell vaccine therapy. Gene therapy."
Follow-up tests,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.''The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment:' SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do."

What is asthma?,"'Asthma is a disorder of the ''lungs'' that causes intermittent symptoms. In the airways there is:''The ''symptoms of asthma'' include:' Swelling or inflammation, specifically in the airway linings Production of large amounts of mucus that is thicker than normal Narrowing because of muscle contractions surrounding the airways Feeling short of breath Frequent coughing, especially at night Wheezing (a whistling noise during breathing) Difficulty breathing Chest tightness"
What is adult-onset asthma?,"'When a doctor makes a diagnosis of asthma in people older than age 20, it is known as adult-onset asthma.''Among those who may be more likely to get adult-onset asthma are:''Irritants that bring on asthma symptoms are called ""asthma triggers."" Asthma brought on by workplace triggers is called ""occupational asthma''.''""'   Women who are having hormonal changes, such as those who are pregnant or who are experiencing menopause Women who take estrogen following menopause for 10 years or longer People who have just had certain viruses or illnesses, such as a cold or flu People with allergies, especially to cats People who have GERD, a type of chronic heartburn with reflux People who are exposed to environmental irritants, such as tobacco smoke, mold, dust, feather beds, or perfume."
What is the difference between childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma?,'Adults tend to have a lower forced expiratory volume (the volume of air you are able to take in and forcibly exhale in one second) after middle age because of changes in muscles and stiffening of chest walls. This decreased lung function may cause doctors to miss the diagnosis of adult-onset asthma.' 
How is adult-onset asthma diagnosed?,"'Your asthma doctor may diagnose adult-onset asthma by:'   Taking a medical history, asking about symptoms, and listening to you breathe Performing a lung function test, using a device called a spirometer, to measure how much air you can exhale after first taking a deep breath and how fast you can empty your lungs. You may be asked before or after the test to inhale a short-acting bronchodilator (medicine that opens the airways by relaxing tight muscles and that also help clear mucus from the lungs). Performing a methacholine challenge test; this asthma test may be performed if your symptoms and spirometry test do not clearly show asthma. When inhaled, methacholine causes the airways to spasm and narrow if asthma is present. During this test, you inhale increasing amounts of methacholine aerosol mist before and after spirometry. The methacholine test is considered positive, meaning asthma is present, if the lung function drops by at least 20%. A bronchodilator is always given at the end of the test to reverse the effects of the methacholine. Performing a chest X-ray. An X-ray is an image of the body that is created by using low doses of radiation reflected on special film or a fluorescent screen. X-rays can be used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, from bronchitis to a broken bone. Your doctor might perform an X-ray exam on you in order to see the structures inside your chest, including the heart, lungs, and bones. By viewing your lungs, your doctor can see if you have a condition other than asthma that may account for your symptoms. Although there may be signs on an X-ray that suggest asthma, a person with asthma will often have a normal chest X-ray."
Who gets asthma?,'Anyone can get asthma at any age. Among those at higher risk for asthma are people who:' Have a family history of asthma Have a history of allergies (allergic asthma) Have smokers living in the household Live in urban areas
How is asthma classified?,"""Asthma is classified into four categories based upon frequency of symptoms and objective measures, such as peak flow measurements and/or spirometry results. These categories are: mild intermittent; mild persistent; moderate persistent; and severe persistent. Your physician will determine the severity and control of your asthma based on how frequently you have symptoms and on lung function tests. It is important to note that a person's asthma symptoms can change from one category to another.""'Mild intermittent asthma''Mild persistent asthma''Moderate persistent asthma''Severe persistent asthma' Symptoms occur less than three times a week, and nighttime symptoms occur less than two times per month. Lung function tests are greater than 80% of predicted values. Predictions are often made on the basis of age, sex, and height. No medications are needed for long-term control. Symptoms occur three to six times per week. Lung function tests are greater than 80% of predicted values. Nighttime symptoms three to four times a month. Symptoms occur daily. Nocturnal symptoms greater than five times per month. Asthma symptoms affect activity, occur more than two times per week, and may last for days. There is a reduction in lung function, with a lung function test range of 60% to 80% of predicted values. Symptoms occur continuously, with frequent nighttime asthma. Activities are limited. Lung function is decreased to less than 60% of predicted values."
How is asthma treated?,"""Asthma can be controlled, but there's no asthma cure. There are, however, certain goals in asthma treatment. If you are unable to achieve all of these goals, it means your asthma is not under control. You should contact your asthma care provider for help with asthma.""'Treatment goals include the following:''Properly using asthma medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is the basis of good asthma control, in addition to avoiding triggers and monitoring daily asthma symptoms. There are two main types of ''asthma medications'':''Asthma medications can be taken by inhaling the medications (using a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or asthma nebulizer) or by swallowing oral medications (pills or liquids). If you are also taking ''drugs'' for other conditions, you should work with your providers to check ''drug interactions'' and simplify medications when possible.'  Live an active, normal life. Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms. Attend work or school every day. Perform daily activities without difficulty. Stop urgent visits to the doctor, emergency room, or hospital. Use and adjust medications to control asthma with little or no side effects. Anti-inflammatories: This is the most important type of medication for most people with asthma. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as inhaled steroids, reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers. These medications need to be taken daily, and may need to be taken for several weeks before they begin to control asthma. Anti-inflammatories lead to a reduction in symptoms, better airflow, less sensitive airways, less airway damage, and fewer asthma episodes. If taken every day, they are helpful in controlling or preventing asthma. Oral steroids are taken for acute flares and help increase the efficacy of other medications and help reduce inflammation. Bronchodilators: These medications relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways. This action rapidly opens the airways, letting more air in and out of the lungs and improving breathing. As the airways open, the mucus moves more freely and can be coughed out more easily. In short-acting forms, bronchodilators known as beta-agonists relieve or stop asthma symptoms and are very helpful during an asthma episode. In long-acting forms, a beta-agonist may be helpful in preventing exercise-induced asthma. An anticholinergic, such as tiotropium bromide (Spiriva Respimat), which is available for individuals age 6 and older, is another long-term maintenance medication for treating asthma."
Monitoring asthma symptoms,"'An important part of treatment is keeping track of how well the lungs are functioning. Asthma symptoms are monitored using a peak flow meter. The meter can alert you to changes in the airways that may be a sign of worsening asthma. By taking daily peak flow readings, you can learn when to adjust medications to keep asthma under good control. Your doctor can also use this information to adjust your treatment plan.' "
Asthma action plan,"'Based on your history and the severity of your asthma, your doctor will develop a care plan called an asthma action plan. The asthma action plan describes when and how to use asthma medications, actions to take when asthma worsens, and when to seek care for an asthma emergency. Make sure you understand this plan; if not, ask your asthma care provider any questions you may have.''WebMD Medical Reference''Reviewed by William Blahd, MD on July 20, 2016''© 2017 WebMD, LLC.

What is abdominal migraine?,"'Like adults, children can develop migraines. This can be the same type of condition seen in adults, which is typically occurs with a ''headache'', and is sometimes preceded by an aura. ''Nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''photophobia'' (decreased tolerance to light) can occur. Children also develop some unusual and atypical variations of migraine, not associated with ''headaches'' in particular, that are not usually observed in adults. Abdominal migraine is one of these variants. ''Abdominal migraine is a condition thought to be related to migraine that is characterized by pain in the abdomen. It is often precipitated by the usual triggers of classic migraine. The pain can be severe, and nausea and vomiting can occur. ''Abdominal migraine is rare in adults, but it has been estimated that up to 2% of all children may develop abdominal migraines. Children who have the condition usually go on to develop migraine ''headaches'' as adults. Girls are affected more frequently than boys. Abdominal migraine typically occurs for the first time between the ages of 2 and 10.'  "
What causes abdominal migraine?,"'The cause of abdominal migraine is poorly understood. Abdominal migraine is thought by some researchers to be related to neurologic or endocrinologic changes and may be caused by alterations in the levels of ''serotonin'' and histamine in the body. Genetic factors may also be involved as the condition is more common in children who have a family history of migraine. About 60% of children with the condition have a positive family history for migraine. ''Triggers for abdominal migraine have been described, similar to triggers for classic migraine. These include ''chocolate'' or nitrite-containing foods, ''stress'', and ''anxiety''.' "
What are the symptoms of abdominal migraine?,"'As mentioned, abdominal migraine causes pain in the abdomen that can be severe and debilitating. It is typically located in the middle portion of the belly, often around the umbilicus. Cramping, nausea, and vomiting can accompany the pain. Pallor (paleness) of the skin is often observed. There may not be associated ''headache''. The symptoms are usually relieved by ''sleep'' and can last anywhere from one hour to several days.' "
How is abdominal migraine diagnosed?,"'Because of the frequent absence of ''headache'', the condition can be difficult to diagnose, especially during the first episode. There is no specific test that can establish the diagnosis of abdominal migraine, so the diagnosis is based on exclusion of other conditions. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are usually directed to rule out other conditions that could be responsible for the symptoms. Electroencephalography (''EEG'') is sometimes done to rule out a''seizure'' disorder as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What is the treatment for abdominal migraine?,"'The treatment of abdominal migraine has two components - to reduce symptoms of an acute attack and to prevent or lessen the severity of future episodes. Research to date has not provided sufficient data to firmly establish the role of any particular medication in either treating symptoms or preventing future episodes of abdominal migraine. Still, many patients respond to anti-migraine medications and other medications.' "
Medications to treat abdominal migraine,"'Types of medications that may be used to manage abdominal migraine include:''Other aspects of treatment may include the administration of intravenous fluids if vomiting is severe, and the use of sedatives or antiemetic drugs.''Treatment may also include advice to recognize and avoid triggers, if these are known. For example, if food triggers have been identified, these should be avoided, although not all those who experience abdominal migraine have identifiable food triggers. ''Stress management'' and relaxation programs may be of benefit to some.' Analgesic drugs, such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or
	acetaminophen Sumatriptan 
	(Imitrex, Alsuma), a member of the triptan 
class of drugs used to treat migraine in adults, has been used to treat some 
older children with abdominal migraine 
Tricyclic antidepressants and drugs 
that block the effects of serotonin have been used in some patients to decrease 
frequency of attacks. Valproic acid (Depakote), an 
antiseizure medication, has been used to treat abdominal migraine. Ergotamine medications, also used for 
adults with migraine, are used to treat some childhood variants of migraine. Low dose aspirin and 
	low dose 
beta-blocker medications have been used over the long term in some patients in 
an attempt to diminish the frequency of future attacks. The antihistamine cyproheptadine has 
been shown to be effective in some children with migraine variants."
What is the prognosis for abdominal migraine?,"'The prognosis for abdominal migraine is good; most children eventually stop having the attacks of ''abdominal pain''. However, most children (about 70% in one study of 54 children) who have abdominal migraine go on to develop migraines in adulthood.' "
What is autism?,"'\tAutism is a developmental disorder that is characterized by impaired development in communication, social interaction, and behavior. It affects the lives of many children and their families. It tends to affect more boys than girls.''\tIn the past, autism has been confused with childhood ''schizophrenia'' or childhood psychosis, and may have been misunderstood as ''schizotypal personality disorder'' in some adults. As additional research information about autism becomes available, the scope and definition of the condition continues to become more refined. Some of the past ''confusion'' about the disorder has been resolved.'  "
What are early signs and symptoms of autism in children and adults?,"'The current ''Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', fifth edition (DSM-V) identifies two features that are associated with autism:'   impairment in social interaction and communication, and behavior."
What are the different types of autism?,"""The group of disorders that formerly included autism, pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger's syndrome, and sometimes Rett's disorder and childhood integrative disorder are now referred to as autism spectrum disorders. The range of these disorders varies from severely impaired individuals that were formerly described as suffering from autism to other, more high-functioning individuals who have abnormalities of social interaction but normal intelligence, who were described as having Asperger's syndrome. The ways in which autism spectrum disorders are exhibited can differ greatly. Additionally, autism can be found in association with other disorders such as mental retardation and certain medical conditions. The degree of autism can range from mild to severe. Mildly affected individuals may appear very close to normal. Severely afflicted individuals may have an extreme intellectual disability and be unable to function in almost any setting.""  "
What causes autism?,"'\tSince autism was first added to the psychiatric literature about 50 years ago, there have been numerous studies and theories about its causes. Researchers still have not reached agreement regarding its specific causes. First, it must be recognized that autism is a set of a wide variety of symptoms and may have many causes. This concept is not unusual in medicine. For instance, the set of symptoms that we perceive of as a ""''cold''"" can be caused by literally hundreds of different ''viruses'', bacteria, and even our own immune system.''\tAutism is thought to be a biologically-based disorder. In the past, some researchers had suggested that autism was the result of poor attachment skills on the part of the mother. This belief has caused a great deal of unnecessary ''pain'' and guilt on the part of the parents of children with autism, when in fact, the inability of the individual with autism to interact appropriately is one of the key symptoms of this developmental disorder. Some risk factors for autism include high maternal age at the time of birth of the child, as well as maternal ''prenatal'' medication use, bleeding, or ''gestational diabetes''. Other support of a biological theory of autism includes that several known neurological disorders are associated with autistic features. Autism is one of the symptoms of these disorders. These conditions include:''\tAutism, in short, seems to be the end result or ""final common pathway"" of numerous disorders that affect brain development. Also, brain studies have demonstrated that persons with autism tend to have a number of abnormalities in brain size. In general, however, when clinicians make the diagnosis of autism, they are excluding the known causes of autistic behaviors. However, as the knowledge of conditions that cause autism advances, fewer and fewer cases will likely be thought of as being ""pure"" autism and more individuals will be identified as having autism due to specific causes.''\tThere is a strong association between autism and ''seizures''. This association works in two ways: First, many patients with autism develop ''seizures''. Second, patients with seizures, which are probably due to other causes, may develop autistic-like behaviors. One special and often misunderstood association between autism and seizures is the ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome''. This syndrome is also known as acquired epileptic ''aphasia''. Some children with ''epilepsy'' develop a sudden loss of language skills -- especially receptive language (the ability to understand). Many often also develop the ''symptoms of autism''.''\tThese children often, but not always, have a characteristic pattern of electrical brain activity seen on ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') during deep ''sleep'' called electrographic status epilepticus during ''sleep'' (ESES). The usual age of onset of language loss or regression is around 4 years of age, which makes the Landau-Kleffner syndrome distinguishable from autism on these grounds, in that autism usually is first exhibited in younger children. However, in recent years, some children (very, very few) who did not exhibit overt (observable) seizures were found to have Landau-Kleffner syndrome.''\tThe importance of these findings is that, although rare, the Landau-Kleffner syndrome can resolve spontaneously and in some cases can be treatable with ''prednisone'', a steroid medication related to cortisone. This association between the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and autism has led many clinicians and families to search for the typical EEG pattern (ESES) in individuals with autism. This unusual EEG pattern is seen only in deep sleep, which usually requires prolonged recordings of up to 12 hours. Many, many children and adults with this disorder will display some abnormalities on their sleep EEG, but probably very few have true Landau-Kleffner syndrome that will respond to treatment.''\tIt must also be noted that prednisone, in the very high doses used to treat Landau-Kleffner syndrome, almost invariably produces side effects, which may include ''weight gain'', ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', growth failure, stomach ulcers, irritability, ''mood swings'', ''hyperactivity'', destruction of the hip joint, and susceptibility to infectious disease (suppressed immune system). While most of these side effects are reversible, some of the complications of high-dose prednisone therapy can be irreversible and even fatal.''\tOther treatments ranging from common anticonvulsant therapy to surgery have been proposed and are being tried for Landau-Kleffner syndrome. It is difficult to evaluate the true effects of any treatment for Landau-Kleffner syndrome due to the high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms (remission).'   
		tuberous sclerosis and the fragile X syndrome (inherited disorder); 
		cerebral dysgenesis (abnormal development of the brain); 
		Rett syndrome (a mutation of a single gene); and 
		some of the inborn errors of metabolism (biochemical defects)."
Is autism genetic?,"'Because many different disorders can result in autism, this question is complex. Certainly, disorders such as the fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, which are both associated with autism, are inherited. There are many families with more than one child with autism where the autism is not clearly due to another cause. Recent studies have found that the gene for at least one kind of familial autism may be on chromosome 13. In some families, autism seems to be passed from generation to generation. In other families, autism is not found in prior generations, but affects multiple siblings (brothers or sisters). The results of this research make it likely that at least one ""autism gene"" will eventually be found. ''However, the majority of individuals with autism do NOT have a strong family history, which supports the premise that environmental or a combination of environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of autism. In this context, environmental is meant to indicate any nongenetic factor, including infections, toxins, ''nutrition'', or others.' "
Impairment of social interaction and communication,"'Individuals with autism fail to develop normal personal interactions in virtually every setting. This means that affected persons fail to form the normal social contacts that are such an important part of human development. This impairment may be so severe that it even affects the bonding between a mother and an infant. It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, many, if not most, persons with this disorder are capable of showing affection, demonstrating affection bonding with their mothers or other caregivers. However, the ways in which individuals with autism demonstrate affection and bonding may differ greatly from the ways in which others do so. Their limited socialization may erroneously lead family members and health professionals away from considering the diagnosis of autism.''As the child develops, interaction with others continues to be abnormal. Affected behaviors can include eye contact, facial expressions, and body postures. There is usually an inability to develop normal peer and sibling relationships and the child often seems isolated. There may be little or no joy or interest in normal age-appropriate activities. Affected children or adults do not seek out peers for play or other social interactions. In severe cases, they may not even be aware of the presence of other individuals.''Communication is usually severely impaired in persons with autism. What the individual understands (receptive language) as well as what is actually spoken by the individual (expressive language) are significantly delayed or nonexistent. Deficits in language comprehension include the inability to understand simple directions, questions, or commands. Persons with a high-functioning autism spectrum disorder might understand simple speech but still have difficulty interpreting the more subtle meaning in conversation. There may be an absence of dramatic or pretend play and these children may not be able to engage in simple age-appropriate childhood games such as Simon Says or Hide-and-Go-Seek. ''Teens'' and adults with autism may continue to engage in playing with games that are for young children and may seek to establish friendships with people much younger than them.''Individuals with autism who do speak may be unable to initiate or participate in a two-way conversation (reciprocal). Frequently the way in which a person with this disorder speaks is perceived as unusual. Their speech may seem to lack the normal emotion and sound flat or monotonous. The sentences are often very immature: ""want water"" instead of ""I want some water, please."" Those with autism often repeat words or phrases that are spoken to them. For example, you might say, ""Look at the airplane!"" and the child or adult may respond ""at airplane,"" without any knowledge of what was said. This repetition is known as ''echolalia''. Memorization and recitation of songs, stories, commercials, or even entire scripts is not uncommon. While many feel this is a sign of intelligence, the autistic person usually does not appear to understand any of the content in his or her speech. ' "
Behaviors,"'\tPersons with autism often exhibit a variety of abnormal behaviors. There may be repetitive actions, a hypersensitivity to sensory input through vision, ''hearing'', or touch (tactile). As a result, there may be an extreme intolerance to loud noises or crowds, visual stimulation, or things that are felt. Birthday parties and other celebrations can be disastrous for some of these individuals. Wearing socks or tags on clothing may be perceived as painful. Sticky fingers, playing with modeling clay, eating birthday cake or other foods, or ''walking'' barefoot across the grass can be unbearable. On the other hand, there may be an underdeveloped (hyposensitivity) response to the same type of stimulation. This individual may use abnormal means to experience visual, auditory, or tactile (touch) input. This person may head bang, scratch until blood is drawn, scream instead of speaking in a normal tone, or bring everything into close visual range. He or she might also touch an object, image, or other people thoroughly just to experience the sensory input.''\tChildren and adults who have autism are often tied to routine and many everyday tasks may be ritualistic. Something as simple as a bath might only be accomplished after the precise amount of water is in the tub, the temperature is exact, the same soap is in its assigned spot, and even the same towel is in the same place. Any break in the routine can provoke a severe reaction in the individual and place a tremendous strain on the adult trying to work with him or her.''\tThere may also be nonpurposeful repetition of actions or behaviors. Persistent rocking, ''teeth grinding'', hair or finger twirling, hand flapping, and walking on tiptoe are not uncommon. Frequently, there is a preoccupation with a very limited interest or a specific plaything. A child or adult may continually play with only one type of toy. The child may line up all the dolls or cars and the adult line up their clothes or toiletries, for example, and repeatedly and systematically perform the same action on each one. Any attempt to disrupt the person may result in extreme reactions on the part of the individual with autism, including tantrums or direct physical attack. Objects that spin, open and close, or perform some other action can hold an extreme fascination. If left alone, a person with this disorder may sit for hours turning off and on a light switch, twirling a spinning toy, or stacking nesting objects. Some individuals can also have an inappropriate bonding to specific objects and become hysterical without that piece of string, paper clip, or wad of paper.' "
How is autism diagnosed in children and adults?,"'The essential features of autism are the significantly impaired or abnormal development of communication and social interaction and the abnormally restricted repertoire of behaviors, activities, and interests. This disturbance in normal development must manifest itself by the time the child is a toddler, prior to age 3. While many parents report normal development in the first year of the child, there is actually limited opportunity to observe this, as the child is often not brought to the attention of a practitioner who has specific experience in diagnosing autism until several years later in many cases. If there is a period of normal development, it cannot extend past age 3. As the early onset of the disorder is a key component in its diagnosis, it is important that practitioners screen for the possible presence of autism in all children from infancy on. As identifying autism as early as possible allows more timely and, therefore, more effective treatment, professionals tend to screen infants and toddlers using a variety of questionnaires, tests, and checklists. Examples of such screening tools include the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test, Second Edition, and the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds.''Any person with a delay or regression (loss) of language or an abnormality of social interaction beginning prior to the age of 3 may be suspected of being autistic. The medical evaluation begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination. This examination should be performed by a health care professional not only familiar with autism, but with other disorders that may appear similar to or mimic the symptoms of autism. The health care professional should have particular expertise in the neurological examination of impaired individuals or recommend consultation with such a professional, as subtle findings may lead the examiner down a particular diagnostic path. For example, the presence of mild ''weakness'' or increased reflexes on one side of the body will lead the examiner to conclude that a structural abnormality in the brain is present and that an ''MRI'' examination of the brain is appropriate.''The history and physical examination will point the examiner to specific diagnostic testing to evaluate for other conditions associated with autism or developmental delay. Any child who has a language delay should have his or her hearing formally evaluated. For example, it is not sufficient to simply determine whether or not a person being examined is able to hear. In order for normal language development to proceed, the individual must have sufficient hearing capabilities at low volumes in the high frequency range. Therefore, even if the person turns his or her head to a clap or shout, he or she may still have enough of a hearing deficit to inhibit language development.''There are two types of hearing tests; 1) behavioral audiometry; and 2) brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER).''If he or she is capable, behavioral audiometry is the preferred method primarily because sedation is not required. Depending upon specific features of the examination and history, the practitioner may want to obtain blood and urine samples for specialized testing to evaluate for some of the inborn errors of metabolism and to obtain DNA for chromosomal studies and fragile X testing.''If the neurological examination is normal, there may be no need for a brain ''CT scan'' or MRI scan. However, if the neurological examination is suggestive of a structural brain lesion, then a neuroimaging study, preferably an MRI, should be performed. Newer imaging procedures such as SPECT or PET scans are used primarily as research tools and have no place in the initial evaluation of the autistic individual. In very specialized instances, such as the autistic person with difficult-to-control seizures, such tests may be useful.''The evaluation of individuals with autism by speech pathologists will provide not only detailed information as to the nature of the language deficits incurred by the afflicted individual, but will also be the first step in formulating a specific treatment plan with respect to language. Occupational assessment may be particularly helpful in determining the day-to-day strengths and vulnerabilities of the individual with autism (for example, sensitivity to clothing and food texture) and assist those who care for the person in promoting his or her strengths and compensating for their challenges.''Given the complex and far-reaching symptoms and effects of autism, it is generally thought that the most accurate and thorough diagnosis of this disorder is obtained by a group of health care professionals from various disciplines, also called a multidisciplinary team, that includes a pediatrician, speech and occupational therapists, educators, and often psychiatrists and others.' Behavioral audiometry is performed by a skilled clinical audiologist. The person being examined is placed in a room and his or her responses to different tones are observed. For the brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) test, the individual is sedated and earphones are placed over the ears. Tones of different volumes and frequencies are played and the electrical response of the brain is monitored."
How is autism treated in children and adults?,'Misinformation about autism is very common. Claims of a cure for autism are constantly presented to families of individuals with autism. There are various treatment models found within both the educational and clinical settings. ' 
What common sociobehavioral interventions are used to treat autism?,"""There is only one treatment approach that has prevailed over time and is effective for all persons, with or without autism. That treatment model is an educational (school or vocational) program that is suitable to a student's developmental level of performance. One such program is the Son-Rise Program. For adults, that treatment model refers to a vocational program that is suitable to the individual's developmental level of functioning.""'Under the federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA) Act of 1990, students with a handicap are guaranteed an ""appropriate education"" in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), which is generally considered to be as normal an educational setting as possible. As a result of this legislation, children with autism have often been placed in a mainstreamed classroom and pulled out for whatever supplementary services were needed. Depending on the child\'s needs, he or she could be placed up to 100% of the school day in a mainstreamed or a special education setting or any combination of the two in order to receive the most appropriate help possible.'""There is an increasing trend, however, in advocacy for children with autism, to segregate these children into small, highly structured and controlled academic and vocational training programs that are almost free from auditory and visual stimulation. All instruction is broken down into manageable segments. Information is presented in tiny units and the child's response is immediately sought. A classic stimulus-response approach is used to maximize learning. Each unit of information is mastered before another is presented. A fundamental behavior such as putting hands on the tabletop, for example, must be mastered before the child is required to perform any other tasks, or before more information is presented. The long-term effects of this type of treatment, as well as the ability of the child to transfer this to a broader context, continue to be evaluated. For people with autism whose symptoms include self injurious behaviors, the focus of treatment has shifted from restriction and punishment to more of a focus on understanding potential motivators for negative behaviors, as well as rewards and other encouragement and support for using appropriate behaviors.""'Children, teens, and adults with autism need to be taught how to communicate and interact with others. This is not a simple task, and it involves the entire family as well as other professionals. Parents of a child or adult with autism must continually educate themselves about new therapies and keep an open mind. Some treatments may be appropriate for some individuals but not for others. Many treatments have yet to be scientifically proven. Treatment decisions should always be made individually after a thorough assessment and based on what is suitable for that person and his or her family.''It is important to remember, despite some recent denials, that autism is usually a lifelong condition. The kind of support that is appropriate will change as the individual develops. Families must beware of treatment programs that give false hope of a cure. Acceptance of the condition in a family member is a very critical, foundational component of any treatment program and is understandably quite difficult.''Psychotherapeutic approaches that have been found to help improve functioning in some persons with autism include comprehensive behavioral therapy to address problematic behaviors. Social skills training and support are important in helping people with autism navigate interactions with others, since many of this population crave social interaction despite their limitations in engaging others socially. Cognitive behavioral treatment in verbal individuals with ''anxiety'' and voice output communication who are less verbal are considered promising areas of treatment as well.' "
Do vaccines play a role in autism?,"'Although some remain convinced that certain ''vaccines'', ''vaccine'' preservatives, or medications taken to treat side effects of ''vaccines'' may cause autism, conventional wisdom is supported by research that continues to consistently demonstrate that immunizations do not cause autism.'  "
What are the common medications used to treat the symptoms of autism? ,"'Several medications have been tried or are being evaluated for the treatment of autism. No medication has consistently proven to be of benefit for either curing or comprehensively managing autism in closely controlled ''clinical trials''. ''In the past, a piece on a television news show prompted a great deal of interest in the hormone secretin as a treatment for autism. A child with autism with chronic gastrointestinal complaints showed dramatic improvement following some routine testing performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' during which a small dose of secretin was administered. The family and their physicians felt that the secretin may have resulted in the improvement in the symptoms of autism. Many physicians began prescribing secretin, which can be expensive. However, studies published appear to completely refute the claim that secretin treatment benefits autistic patients. This example underscores the importance of good clinical trials to determine whether a drug will help patients with autism before it is widely used. ''Some medications have been found to help address some symptoms that may present in autism. For example, ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol'') and ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify'') are thought to help treat aggression and ''methylphenidate'' has been determined to be helpful in addressing hyperactivity and other ''symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') in persons with autism. ''Risperidone'' (''Risperdal'') has been found to be quite helpful in many people whose autistic symptoms include odd, repetitive behaviors (stereotypies), hyperactivity, irritability, throwing tantrums, being aggressive towards others, and of injuring oneself.' "
Can diet and supplements play a role in the treatment of autism?,"'A number of ''dietary supplements'' are often given to persons with autism. Examples of such interventions include ''omega-3 fatty acids''. While a significant percentage of people with autism are given dietary ''supplements'' as part of treatment, there is insufficient research to determine whether or not such interventions are helpful or harmful.'  "
How does autism impact the family?,"'Having a family member with autism presents emotional, social, and financial challenges. The ''stress'"" placed on parents and other family members of people with autism can be influenced by a number of factors. Examples of such factors include how well the person with autism functions, how much social support the family receives, and sometimes the ethnicity of the person's parents. Siblings of children and teens with autism seem to fare better in their understanding and acceptance of the family member with autism when provided with education about their loved one's condition.""  "
What is the prognosis for children and adults with autism?,"'Persons with autism seem to have a higher mortality rate at younger ages compared to average individuals. This is particularly true for mortality that is related to seizures or infection. It is, therefore, important for the autistic population to receive good medical care from health care professionals who have knowledge and experience in addressing their unique medical needs.''Due to a number of potential factors, autistic persons tend to be vulnerable to nutritional problems. Specifically, factors like variations in appetite, refusal of many foods, ''food allergies'"", and side effects to some medications can disproportionately impact the food intake, and therefore, the nutritional status of this population. Individuals with autism have been found to be vulnerable to respiratory problems as well, which results in this population having more doctors' visits than people who do not have autism. As people with autism also are vulnerable to emotional struggles like ""'anxiety'', ''depression'', and attention problems, the help of ''mental health'' professionals should be sought when appropriate.'

What are the signs and symptoms of jaundice in adults?,"'As already mentioned, jaundice is not a disease, but rather a visible sign of an underlying disease process. Individuals with jaundice will have a yellow discoloration of the skin to varying degrees, and may also exhibit yellowing of the mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes. However, depending on the underlying cause of jaundice, individuals may experience different symptoms. Some individuals may have very few, if any, symptoms at all, while others may experience more severe and pronounced symptoms. Individuals with jaundice may experience any of the following signs and symptoms.'   Pale-colored stools Dark-colored urine Skin itching Nausea and vomiting Rectal bleeding Diarrhea Fever and chills Weakness Weight loss Loss of appetite Confusion Abdominal pain Headache Swelling of the legs Swelling and distension of the abdomen due to the accumulation of fluid (ascites)"
How common is jaundice in adutls? Who gets it?,"'The risk factors for developing jaundice vary based upon the underlying cause.' Certain people with hereditary conditions (for example, thalassemia or hereditary spherocytosis) are at an increased risk of developing jaundice from hemolysis. People who consume alcohol heavily are at an increased risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis leading to jaundice. People who are at an increased risk of exposure to the different types of viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) are at risk of developing jaundice at the time of infection or subsequently, if liver disease occurs or if liver cancer develops later. Other risk factors include:Eating raw shellfishDrug injections of other substancesTattooingBirth between 1945 and 1965Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis)Healthcare professionalsParticipating in high-risk sexual activity Eating raw shellfish Drug injections of other substances Tattooing Birth between 1945 and 1965 Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis) Healthcare professionals Participating in high-risk sexual activity"
What causes jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice in adults is caused by various medical conditions that affect the normal metabolism or excretion of bilirubin. Bilirubin is mostly formed from the daily breakdown and destruction of ''red blood cells'' in the bloodstream, which release ''hemoglobin'' as they rupture. The heme portion of this hemoglobin molecule is then converted into bilirubin, which is transported in the bloodstream to the ''liver'' for further metabolism and excretion. In the liver, the bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid (made more water-soluble), and is excreted into the gallbladder (where it is stored) and then eventually passed into the ''intestines''. In the intestines, a portion of the bilirubin is excreted in the feces, while some are metabolized by the intestinal bacteria to urobilinogen and excreted in the urine.''Jaundice occurs if there is a dysfunction of the normal metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This disruption in the metabolism or excretion of bilirubin can occur at various stages, and it is, therefore, useful to classify the different causes of jaundice based on where the dysfunction occurs. The causes of jaundice are generally classified as pre-hepatic (the problem arises before secretion to the liver), hepatic (the problem arises within the liver), and post-hepatic (the problem arises after bilirubin is excreted from the liver).'""Jaundice caused during the pre-hepatic phase is due to the excessive destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells from various conditions. This rapid increase in bilirubin levels in the bloodstream overwhelms the liver's capability to properly metabolize the bilirubin, and consequently the levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase. Conditions which can lead to an increase in the hemolysis of red blood cells include:""   Malaria, Sickle cell disease, Hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), Drugs or other toxins, and Autoimmune disorders."
What causes jaundice during the hepatic phase in adults?,"'Jaundice caused during the hepatic phase can arise from abnormalities in the metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This can lead to an increase in both unconjugated and/or conjugated bilirubin levels. Conditions with a hepatic cause of jaundice include:' Acute or chronic hepatitis (commonly viral [Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E] or alcohol related) Cirrhosis (caused by various conditions incuding alcohol toxicity) Drugs or other toxins Crigler-Najjar syndrome Autoimmune disorders Gilbert's syndrome Liver cancer"
What are post-hepatic causes of jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice from a post-hepatic cause arises from a disruption (an obstruction) in the normal drainage and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the form of bile from the liver into the intestine. This leads to increased levels of conjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream. Conditions that can cause post-hepatic jaundice include' Gallstones, Cancer (pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer), Strictures of the bile ducts, Cholangitis, Pancreatitis, and Parasites (for example, liver flukes)."
What tests and procedures diagnose jaundice in adults?,"'The presence of jaundice requires a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the cause. Initially, your health-care professional will take a detailed history of your illness and perform a physical exam, which can sometimes determine the cause of the jaundice. Initial blood testing will also be undertaken, with special attention being given to your:''Blood testing for exposure to hepatitis may also be ordered. Additional blood testing may be ordered based on the initial results. A ''urinalysis'' will likely also be ordered.''Depending on the results of initial blood tests, further studies may be needed to help diagnose the underlying disease process. In certain cases, imaging studies will need to be obtained in order to evaluate for any abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. These imaging studies may include:''Occasionally, people will need further invasive testing to determine the cause of the jaundice. Procedures that may be ordered include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') or a ''liver biopsy''.' Liver blood tests Complete blood count (CBC) Electrolyte pane Lipase levels  Abdominal ultrasound Computerized tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)"
What is the treatment for jaundice in adults?,"'The treatment for jaundice depends entirely on the underlying cause. Once a diagnosis has been established, the appropriate course of treatment can then be initiated. Certain patients will require hospitalization, whereas others may be managed as outpatients at home.'   In certain individuals with jaundice, the treatment will consist of supportive care and can be managed at home. For example, most cases of mild viral hepatitis can be managed at home with watchful waiting and close monitoring by your doctor (expectant management). Novel medications for hepatitis C now can offer a cure for this condition. Alcohol cessation is necessary in patients with cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, or acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use. Jaundice caused by drugs/medications/toxins requires discontinuation of the offending agent. In cases of intentional or unintentional acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, the antidote N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may be required. Various medications may be used to treat the conditions leading to jaundice, such as steroids in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders. Certain patients with cirrhosis, for example, may require treatment with diuretics and lactulose. Antibiotics may be required for infectious causes of jaundice, or for the complications associated with certain conditions leading to jaundice (for example, cholangitis). Blood transfusions may be required in individuals with anemia from hemolysis or as a result of bleeding. Individuals with cancer leading to jaundice will require consultation with an oncologist, and the treatment will vary depending on the type and extent (staging) of the cancer. Surgery and various invasive procedures may be required for certain patients with jaundice. For example, certain patients with gallstones may require surgery. Other individuals with liver failure/cirrhosis may require a liver transplant."
What are the complications of jaundice in adults?,"'The type of complication and the severity of complications vary with the underlying cause leading to jaundice. Certain individuals will not suffer any long-term after effects and will have a full recovery, while for others the appearance of jaundice will be the first indication of a life-threatening condition. A few of the potential complications include:'   Electrolyte abnormalities Anemia Bleeding Infection/sepsis Chronic hepatitis Cancer Liver failure Kidney failure Hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) Death"
What is the prognosis for an adult with jaundice? Can it be cured? Is it fatal?,"""The prognosis for individuals with jaundice depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There are certain conditions that carry an excellent prognosis with individuals making a full recovery. However, more serious causes of jaundice can sometimes be fatal despite medical or surgical intervention. The development and severity of complications will also determine an individual's prognosis, as will a patient's underlying health and comorbidities (presence of other diseases). Therefore, a case-by-case assessment by your health care professional is necessary in order to determine a more accurate prognosis."" "
Can jaundice in adults be prevented?,"'Certain conditions leading to jaundice can be prevented, whereas others may be less preventable. However, there are certain measures that can be taken in order to decrease the risk of developing jaundice.' Take medications as instructed in order to prevent potential liver damage or unintentional overdose. Individuals with certain medical conditions (for example, G6PD deficiency or cirrhosis) should avoid certain medications altogether. Discuss medications with your health care professional. Avoid high-risk behaviors such as unprotected intercourse or intravenous drug use, and implement universal precautions when working with blood products and needles. This can decrease your risk of developing hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. There is currently no available vaccine against hepatitis C. Avoid potentially contaminated food products or unsanitary water, as this may decrease your risk of developing hepatitis A. When travelling to areas where malaria is endemic, take the recommended precautions and prophylactic medications in order to prevent the development of malaria. Consume alcohol responsibly and only in moderation. This can prevent alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis and pancreatitis, among other conditions. Certain individuals will need to avoid alcohol altogether. Avoid smoking, as it is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer, as well as many other malignancies."
Introduction to advance medical directives,"'''Advance directives'': The term ""advance directives"" refers to treatment preferences and the designation of a surrogate decision-maker in the event that a person should become unable to make medical decisions on her or his own behalf.''Advance directives generally fall into three categories: living will, power of attorney, and health-care proxy.''Living will'': This is a written document that specifies what types of medical treatment are desired should the individual become incapacitated. A living will can be general or very specific. The most common statement in a living will is to the effect that'""More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual's desire for such services such as""'Health-care proxy'':  This is a legal document in which an individual designates another person to make health-care decisions if he or she is rendered incapable of making their wishes known.  The health-care proxy has, in essence, the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if capable of making and communicating decisions.''Durable power of attorney (DPOA)'': Through this type of advance directive, an individual executes legal documents that provide the power of attorney to others in the case of an incapacitating medical condition.  The durable power of attorney allows an individual to make bank transactions, sign social security checks, apply for disability, or simply write checks to pay the utility bill while an individual is medically incapacitated.'""DPOA can also specifically designate different individuals to act on a person's behalf for specific affairs. For example, one person can be designated the DPOA of health-care or medical power of attorney, similar to the health-care proxy, while another individual can be made the legal DPOA.""  if I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued. analgesia (pain relief), antibiotics, artificial (intravenous or IV) hydration, artificial feeding (feeding tube), CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), life-support equipment including ventilators (breathing machines), do not resuscitate (DNR)."
What is the importance of an advance directive?,"'Advance directives were developed as a result of widespread concerns over patients undergoing unwanted medical treatments and procedures in effort to preserve life at any cost.  As outlined in the following section (history of advance directives), remarkable efforts were made to institute advance medical directives as a component of medical care in the United States over the last few decades.'""From a practical standpoint, medical directives and living wills facilitate a person's medical care and decision making in situations when they are temporarily or permanently unable make decisions or verbalize their decisions. By having previously documented personal wishes and preferences, the family's and physicians' immense decision-making burden is lightened. At the same time, patient autonomy and dignity are preserved by tailoring medical care based on one's own choices regardless of mental or physical capacity.""'Instructive directives (advance directives, living wills, and health-care proxy designation) are completed by a person with decision-making capacity. They only become effective when a person loses his/her decision-making capacity (mentally incapacitated).  While a person maintains ability to make decisions, he/she is the ultimate decision-maker rather than the health-care proxy or surrogate decision-maker.' "
What is the history of advance directives?,"'Advance directives began to be developed in the United States in the late 1960s.''The first living wills'': In 1967, an attorney named Luis Kutner suggested the first living will.  Kutner\'s goal was to facilitate ""the rights of dying people to control decisions about their own medical care.""''In 1968, the first living will legislation was presented to a state legislature.  Walter F. Sackett, a doctor elected to the Florida legislature, introduced a bill that would allow patients to make decisions regarding the future use of life-sustaining equipment.  The bill failed to pass in 1968.  Sackett reintroduced the bill in 1973 and it was again defeated.'""While Dr. Sackett was introducing living will legislation in Florida, Barry Keene was presenting similar bills in the California legislature.  Keene's interest in living wills was based on personal experience.  In 1972, Keene's mother-in-law was unable to limit medical treatment for a terminal illness even after having signed a power of attorney.  Keene was elected to the California State senate in 1974.  The living will legislation he designed was defeated that same year.  Keene reintroduced the bill in 1976 and in September of that year California became the first state in the nation to legally sanction living wills.""'The states'': Within a year, 43 states had considered living will legislation and seven states had passed bills. Advance directive legislation has subsequently progressed on a state-by-state basis. By 1992, all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, had passed legislation to legalize some form of advance directive.''The first court decision to validate advance directives was at the state level. The decision was handed down by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1976.  In Case 70 N.J. 10, 355 A 2nd 647, Chief Justice Robert Hughes upheld the following judicial principles:''The case in which Judge Hughes ruled was the request by Joe Quinlan to make legally binding health-care decisions for his daughter, Karen Ann Quinlan.  As a result of the case, Karen Ann Quinlan was gradually weaned from mechanical ventilation.''The federal government'': The U.S. federal government has evidenced its interest in advance directives through two of its bodies, the Congress and the Supreme Court.''The U.S. House of Representatives in 1991 enacted the Patient Self-Determination Act. The Act stipulates that all hospitals receiving Medicaid or Medicare reimbursement must ascertain whether patients have or wish to have advance directives.  The Patient Self-Determination Act does not create or legalize advance directives; rather it validates their existence in each of the states.''It was not until 1990 that the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the legality of advance directives.  The Supreme Court had been reticent to hear cases on advance directives, reflecting to some degree the belief that advance directives are determined at the state rather than federal level.  In 1990, the Court heard Cruzan vs. Director.  The case, similar to that of Karen Ann Quinlan, involved the desire to discontinue the percutaneous gastrostomy feedings of Nancy Cruzan.  The United States Supreme Court decided in favor of the individual right to refuse treatment, even life-sustaining treatment.  The Supreme Court refused to hand down a specific decision on medical treatment in the case.  Following the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case was referred back to the Missouri Supreme Court.  The Missouri Supreme Court heard testimony of a verbal advance directive that was deemed to be sufficient evidence to support the refusal of medical treatment.''The landmark Quinlan and Cruzan cases emerged out of similar situations and similar needs.  Both cases dealt with the medical care of young, physically strong people in a persistent vegetative state. While similar in these regards, the two judicial decisions dealt with different types of advance directives.  The case of Karen Ann Quinlan dealt with the ability of the individual to appoint a health-care proxy. The case of Nancy Cruzan addressed the right of a healthy individual to establish a binding living will.' If patients are mentally unable to make treatment decisions, someone else may exercise their right for them. Decisions that can lead to the death of a mentally incompetent patient are better made not by courts but by families, with the input of their doctors. Decisions about end-of-life care should take into consideration both the invasiveness of the treatment involved and the patient's likelihood of recovery. Patients have the right to refuse treatment even if this refusal might lead to death."
The current situation,"'In the United States, four out of every five adults has no advance directive, a situation that some have likened to taking your car to the mechanic and saying, ""I think it needs a tune-up, but if you find something really wrong with it, just go ahead and fix it, even if it won\'t run afterward? And by the way, please charge me for the work and if I can\'t pay for it, I\'m sure my estate will!""''When asked what would provide a good death, the majority of Americans answer, in essence; ""Quick, painless, at home, and surrounded by family.""''In 1950, about half of Americans who died did so at home.  Now, about 85% of Americans die in a health-care setting: a hospital, a ''nursing'' home, or a rehabilitation center.  At least 12% die in an intensive-care unit.''Over the past three decades, the United States - all 50 states and the District of Columbia -- have passed laws to legalize the use of living wills, health-care proxies, and/or the durable power of attorney. The U.S. federal government has validated state laws on advance directives through the 1991 Patient Self- Determination Act. And the U.S. Supreme Court has handed down an opinion acknowledging the congruence of the Constitution of the United States with state laws on the right to designate future medical treatment.' "
When do advance directives become helpful?,"'Advance directives become active when a patient is no longer able to make his/her own health-care decisions or becomes mentally incapacitated. Until such point is reached, the patient is the ultimate decision maker regarding their health.''Some common scenarios where these directives can help with the decision making process are'""Advance directives not only help with decision-making in times of incapacity, but they can also clarify one's preferences during times of uncertainties while still cognitively intact. At times, deciding whether to accept or decline a treatment may overwhelm a person and cast uncertain on their judgment.  By referring to previously delineated preferences based on overall goals of care, such decisions may become simpler to make as smaller components of a bigger picture."" coma, persistent vegetative state, severe brain injury, strokes, advanced Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, critical medical illness affecting mental capacity."
How can one obtain and prepare living will and advance medical directive forms?,"""Preparing documents for a living will and advance directive can be done at any time during an adult person's lifetime.  As one's preference can naturally change during one's life, these documents can also be amended and modified to reflect the changes.""' Obtaining medical advance directive documents is simple. Medical offices, hospitals, social workers, attorneys, and even post offices may carry these documents.  In fact, hospitals receiving medical and Medicaid payments are required to offer their patients these documents.''A good place to begin this process is an open discussion with a primary-care doctor or other treating physicians. As stated earlier, living wills and advance directives can be very broad or quite specific. Meanings, implications, risks, and benefits of components of an advance directive deserve clear understanding before they are signed in a legally binding document that may be relied upon for end-of-life decisions.''Selecting a person as a medical power of attorney is also an important decision. The surrogate decision maker does not necessarily need to be a family member or a relative.  In truth, any person in whom an individual trusts to carry out their wishes on their behalf and in good faith, can be designated as a health-care proxy.''Additionally, because these are legal documents of various forms, appropriate and accurate drafting with the help of an attorney is advised. Furthermore, as regulations may vary from state to state, your attorney can also guide you through how to do a living will and an advance directive.'""Although it is highly encouraged, it is often difficult to address issues pertaining to terminal illnesses, end-of-life care, and death with loved ones and caregivers.  Despite having proper documentation, it is important for family members and caregivers to have some general knowledge about a patient's preferences.  More importantly, family members or anyone close to the individual must know where these documents are located and be able to provide them or refer to them in cases of emergency. It is also extremely beneficial to have extra copies of these documents and to bring them with the patient to the hospital, emergency room, or even doctors' offices.""'Previous contributing author: Maude Bancroft Hecht, RN' "
Introduction to advance medical directives,"'''Advance directives'': The term ""advance directives"" refers to treatment preferences and the designation of a surrogate decision-maker in the event that a person should become unable to make medical decisions on her or his own behalf.''Advance directives generally fall into three categories: living will, power of attorney, and health-care proxy.''Living will'': This is a written document that specifies what types of medical treatment are desired should the individual become incapacitated. A living will can be general or very specific. The most common statement in a living will is to the effect that'""More specific living wills may include information regarding an individual's desire for such services such as""'Health-care proxy'':  This is a legal document in which an individual designates another person to make health-care decisions if he or she is rendered incapable of making their wishes known.  The health-care proxy has, in essence, the same rights to request or refuse treatment that the individual would have if capable of making and communicating decisions.''Durable power of attorney (DPOA)'': Through this type of advance directive, an individual executes legal documents that provide the power of attorney to others in the case of an incapacitating medical condition.  The durable power of attorney allows an individual to make bank transactions, sign social security checks, apply for disability, or simply write checks to pay the utility bill while an individual is medically incapacitated.'""DPOA can also specifically designate different individuals to act on a person's behalf for specific affairs. For example, one person can be designated the DPOA of health-care or medical power of attorney, similar to the health-care proxy, while another individual can be made the legal DPOA.""  if I suffer an incurable, irreversible illness, disease, or condition and my attending physician determines that my condition is terminal, I direct that life-sustaining measures that would serve only to prolong my dying be withheld or discontinued. analgesia (pain relief), antibiotics, artificial (intravenous or IV) hydration, artificial feeding (feeding tube), CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), life-support equipment including ventilators (breathing machines), do not resuscitate (DNR)."
What is the importance of an advance directive?,"'Advance directives were developed as a result of widespread concerns over patients undergoing unwanted medical treatments and procedures in effort to preserve life at any cost.  As outlined in the following section (history of advance directives), remarkable efforts were made to institute advance medical directives as a component of medical care in the United States over the last few decades.'""From a practical standpoint, medical directives and living wills facilitate a person's medical care and decision making in situations when they are temporarily or permanently unable make decisions or verbalize their decisions. By having previously documented personal wishes and preferences, the family's and physicians' immense decision-making burden is lightened. At the same time, patient autonomy and dignity are preserved by tailoring medical care based on one's own choices regardless of mental or physical capacity.""'Instructive directives (advance directives, living wills, and health-care proxy designation) are completed by a person with decision-making capacity. They only become effective when a person loses his/her decision-making capacity (mentally incapacitated).  While a person maintains ability to make decisions, he/she is the ultimate decision-maker rather than the health-care proxy or surrogate decision-maker.' "
What is the history of advance directives?,"'Advance directives began to be developed in the United States in the late 1960s.''The first living wills'': In 1967, an attorney named Luis Kutner suggested the first living will.  Kutner\'s goal was to facilitate ""the rights of dying people to control decisions about their own medical care.""''In 1968, the first living will legislation was presented to a state legislature.  Walter F. Sackett, a doctor elected to the Florida legislature, introduced a bill that would allow patients to make decisions regarding the future use of life-sustaining equipment.  The bill failed to pass in 1968.  Sackett reintroduced the bill in 1973 and it was again defeated.'""While Dr. Sackett was introducing living will legislation in Florida, Barry Keene was presenting similar bills in the California legislature.  Keene's interest in living wills was based on personal experience.  In 1972, Keene's mother-in-law was unable to limit medical treatment for a terminal illness even after having signed a power of attorney.  Keene was elected to the California State senate in 1974.  The living will legislation he designed was defeated that same year.  Keene reintroduced the bill in 1976 and in September of that year California became the first state in the nation to legally sanction living wills.""'The states'': Within a year, 43 states had considered living will legislation and seven states had passed bills. Advance directive legislation has subsequently progressed on a state-by-state basis. By 1992, all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, had passed legislation to legalize some form of advance directive.''The first court decision to validate advance directives was at the state level. The decision was handed down by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1976.  In Case 70 N.J. 10, 355 A 2nd 647, Chief Justice Robert Hughes upheld the following judicial principles:''The case in which Judge Hughes ruled was the request by Joe Quinlan to make legally binding health-care decisions for his daughter, Karen Ann Quinlan.  As a result of the case, Karen Ann Quinlan was gradually weaned from mechanical ventilation.''The federal government'': The U.S. federal government has evidenced its interest in advance directives through two of its bodies, the Congress and the Supreme Court.''The U.S. House of Representatives in 1991 enacted the Patient Self-Determination Act. The Act stipulates that all hospitals receiving Medicaid or Medicare reimbursement must ascertain whether patients have or wish to have advance directives.  The Patient Self-Determination Act does not create or legalize advance directives; rather it validates their existence in each of the states.''It was not until 1990 that the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the legality of advance directives.  The Supreme Court had been reticent to hear cases on advance directives, reflecting to some degree the belief that advance directives are determined at the state rather than federal level.  In 1990, the Court heard Cruzan vs. Director.  The case, similar to that of Karen Ann Quinlan, involved the desire to discontinue the percutaneous gastrostomy feedings of Nancy Cruzan.  The United States Supreme Court decided in favor of the individual right to refuse treatment, even life-sustaining treatment.  The Supreme Court refused to hand down a specific decision on medical treatment in the case.  Following the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case was referred back to the Missouri Supreme Court.  The Missouri Supreme Court heard testimony of a verbal advance directive that was deemed to be sufficient evidence to support the refusal of medical treatment.''The landmark Quinlan and Cruzan cases emerged out of similar situations and similar needs.  Both cases dealt with the medical care of young, physically strong people in a persistent vegetative state. While similar in these regards, the two judicial decisions dealt with different types of advance directives.  The case of Karen Ann Quinlan dealt with the ability of the individual to appoint a health-care proxy. The case of Nancy Cruzan addressed the right of a healthy individual to establish a binding living will.' If patients are mentally unable to make treatment decisions, someone else may exercise their right for them. Decisions that can lead to the death of a mentally incompetent patient are better made not by courts but by families, with the input of their doctors. Decisions about end-of-life care should take into consideration both the invasiveness of the treatment involved and the patient's likelihood of recovery. Patients have the right to refuse treatment even if this refusal might lead to death."
The current situation,"'In the United States, four out of every five adults has no advance directive, a situation that some have likened to taking your car to the mechanic and saying, ""I think it needs a tune-up, but if you find something really wrong with it, just go ahead and fix it, even if it won\'t run afterward? And by the way, please charge me for the work and if I can\'t pay for it, I\'m sure my estate will!""''When asked what would provide a good death, the majority of Americans answer, in essence; ""Quick, painless, at home, and surrounded by family.""''In 1950, about half of Americans who died did so at home.  Now, about 85% of Americans die in a health-care setting: a hospital, a ''nursing'' home, or a rehabilitation center.  At least 12% die in an intensive-care unit.''Over the past three decades, the United States - all 50 states and the District of Columbia -- have passed laws to legalize the use of living wills, health-care proxies, and/or the durable power of attorney. The U.S. federal government has validated state laws on advance directives through the 1991 Patient Self- Determination Act. And the U.S. Supreme Court has handed down an opinion acknowledging the congruence of the Constitution of the United States with state laws on the right to designate future medical treatment.' "
When do advance directives become helpful?,"'Advance directives become active when a patient is no longer able to make his/her own health-care decisions or becomes mentally incapacitated. Until such point is reached, the patient is the ultimate decision maker regarding their health.''Some common scenarios where these directives can help with the decision making process are'""Advance directives not only help with decision-making in times of incapacity, but they can also clarify one's preferences during times of uncertainties while still cognitively intact. At times, deciding whether to accept or decline a treatment may overwhelm a person and cast uncertain on their judgment.  By referring to previously delineated preferences based on overall goals of care, such decisions may become simpler to make as smaller components of a bigger picture."" coma, persistent vegetative state, severe brain injury, strokes, advanced Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, critical medical illness affecting mental capacity."
How can one obtain and prepare living will and advance medical directive forms?,"""Preparing documents for a living will and advance directive can be done at any time during an adult person's lifetime.  As one's preference can naturally change during one's life, these documents can also be amended and modified to reflect the changes.""' Obtaining medical advance directive documents is simple. Medical offices, hospitals, social workers, attorneys, and even post offices may carry these documents.  In fact, hospitals receiving medical and Medicaid payments are required to offer their patients these documents.''A good place to begin this process is an open discussion with a primary-care doctor or other treating physicians. As stated earlier, living wills and advance directives can be very broad or quite specific. Meanings, implications, risks, and benefits of components of an advance directive deserve clear understanding before they are signed in a legally binding document that may be relied upon for end-of-life decisions.''Selecting a person as a medical power of attorney is also an important decision. The surrogate decision maker does not necessarily need to be a family member or a relative.  In truth, any person in whom an individual trusts to carry out their wishes on their behalf and in good faith, can be designated as a health-care proxy.''Additionally, because these are legal documents of various forms, appropriate and accurate drafting with the help of an attorney is advised. Furthermore, as regulations may vary from state to state, your attorney can also guide you through how to do a living will and an advance directive.'""Although it is highly encouraged, it is often difficult to address issues pertaining to terminal illnesses, end-of-life care, and death with loved ones and caregivers.  Despite having proper documentation, it is important for family members and caregivers to have some general knowledge about a patient's preferences.  More importantly, family members or anyone close to the individual must know where these documents are located and be able to provide them or refer to them in cases of emergency. It is also extremely beneficial to have extra copies of these documents and to bring them with the patient to the hospital, emergency room, or even doctors' offices.""'Previous contributing author: Maude Bancroft Hecht, RN' "
What is atrial fibrillation?,'Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which the electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper atria (chambers) of the heart. Many people with this condition have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). It is the most common supraventricular tachycardia.' 
"What is the normal function of the heart, and how does its electrical system work?","'The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles: 1) the ''right atrium'' (upper right); 2) the ''left atrium'' (upper left); 3) the ''right ventricle'' (lower right); and 4) the ''left ventricle'' (lower left).''Blood returning to the heart from the body contains low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. This blood flows into the right ''atrium'' and then down into the adjacent right ventricle. After the right ventricle fills, contraction of the right ''atrium'' pumps additional blood into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the ''lungs'' where the blood takes up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The blood then flows from the lungs to the left atrium, and then down into the adjacent left ventricle. Contraction of the left atrium pumps additional blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the aortic artery and then to the rest of the body via the vascular system.''The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles. The ventricles must deliver enough blood to the body for the body to function normally. The amount of blood that is pumped depends on several factors. The most important factor is the rate of contraction of the heart (the heart rate). As the rate increases, more blood is pumped. The heart pumps more blood with each beat when the atria contract and fill the ventricles with additional blood just before the ventricles contract.''With each beat of the heart, an electrical discharge (current) passes through the electrical system of the heart. This discharge causes the muscle of the atria and ventricles to contract and pump blood.''The electrical system of the heart consists of the SA node (sinoatrial node), the ''AV node'' (''atrioventricular node''), and special tissues in the atria and the ventricles that conduct the current.''The electrical discharges from the SA node cause the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The same discharges then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, traveling through the special tissues of the ventricles and causing the ventricles to contract. In a normal heart, the rate of atrial contraction is the same as the rate of ventricular contraction.''At rest, the frequency of the discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate in individuals who are in good clinical health.' The SA node is the heart's electrical pacemaker. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the right atrium; the frequency with which the SA node discharges determines the rate at which the heart beats. The current passes from the SA node, through the special tissues of the atria and into the AV node. The AV node serves as a relay station between the atria and the ventricles. Signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles."
What causes atrial fibrillation?,"'The cause of atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm. During this rhythm, electrical discharges are not generated solely by the SA node. Instead, discharges come from other parts of the atria. These abnormal discharges are rapid and irregular and may exceed 350 discharges per minute. The rapid and irregular discharges cause ineffective contractions of the atria. In fact, the atria quiver rather than beat as a unit. This reduces the ability of the atria to pump blood into the ventricles.''The rapid and irregular discharges from the atria then pass through the AV node and into the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The contractions of the ventricles may average 150/minute, much slower than the rate in the atria. (The ventricles are unable to contract at 350/minute.) Even at an average rate of 150/minute, the ventricles may not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before the next contraction, particularly without the normal contraction of the atria. Thus, AFib decreases the amount of blood pumped by the ventricles because of their rapid rate of contraction and the absence of normal atrial contractions.' "
What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,"'Many patients with this condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and are unaware of the abnormal rhythm. When symptoms do occur, the most common one is heart ''palpitations'', an uncomfortable awareness of the rapid and irregular heartbeat. Other symptoms of the condition are caused by the diminished delivery of blood to the body. These symptoms include:''In a heart that is beating normally, the rate of ventricular contraction is the same as the rate of atrial contraction. In atrial fibrillation, however, the rate of ventricular contraction is less than the rate of atrial contraction. The rate of ventricular contraction in the condition is determined by the speed of transmission of the discharges through the AV node. In people with a normal AV node, the rate of ventricular contraction in untreated disease usually ranges from 80 to 180 beats/minute; the higher the transmission, the higher the heart rate.''Some older people have slow transmission through the AV node due to disease within the AV node. When these people develop the problem, their heart rates remain normal or slower than normal. As disease in the AV node advances, these people can even develop an excessively slow heart rate and require a permanent pacemaker to increase the rate of ventricular contractions.'   Dizziness Fainting Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath Angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles)"
How can I know if I am at risk for developing atrial fibrillation?,"'There are many risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation. They include:''About 1 in 10,000 young adults in otherwise good health have the disease without any apparent cause or underlying cardiac problems. Atrial fibrillation of the heart in these individuals usually is intermittent, but can become chronic in 25%. This condition is referred to as lone AFib. ''Stress'', alcohol, tobacco, or use of ''stimulants'' may play a role in causing this ''arrhythmia''.' Increased age (1% of people over 60 years of age have the disease) Coronary disease (including heart attack) High blood pressure Abnormal heart muscle function (including congestive heart failure) Disease of the mitral valve between the left and right ventricle An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or overdose of thyroid medication Low amounts of oxygen in the blood, for example, as occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart (pericarditis) Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Chronic lung diseases (emphysema, asthma, COPD) Excessive intake of alcohol (alcoholism) Stimulant drug use such as cocaine or decongestants Recent heart or lung surgery Abnormal heart structure from the time of birth (congenital)"
How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?,"'Atrial fibrillation can be chronic and sustained, or brief and intermittent (paroxysmal). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refers to ''intermittent episodes of AF'' lasting, for example, minutes to hours. The rate reverts to normal between episodes. In ''chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation'"", the atria fibrillate all of the time. Chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation is not difficult to diagnose. Doctors can hear the rapid and irregular heartbeats using a stethoscope. Abnormal heartbeats also can be felt by taking a patient's pulse and by a doctor's diagnosis."" EKG (electrocardiogram): An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. The irregular EKG tracings of AF are easy to recognize provided AF occurs during the EKG. Echocardiography: Echocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce images of the chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Conditions that may accompany AF such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic valve diseases, and pericarditis (inflammation of the ""sack"" surrounding the heart) can be detected with echocardiography. Echocardiography also is useful in measuring the size of the atrial chambers. Atrial size is an important factor in determining how a patient responds to treatment for the disease. For instance, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain a normal rhythm in patients with enlarged atria. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a special echocardiographic technique that involves taking pictures of the atria using sound waves. A special probe that generates sound waves is placed in the esophagus (the food pipe connecting the mouth to the stomach). The probe is located at the end of a long flexible tube that is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. This technique brings the probe very close to the heart (which lies just in front of the esophagus). Sound waves generated by the probe are bounced off the structures within the heart, and the reflected sound waves are used to form a picture of the heart. TEE is very accurate for detecting blood clots in the atria as well as for measuring the size of the atria. Holter monitor: If episodes of the disease occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show AF. Therefore, a Holter monitor, a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours, often is used to diagnose intermittent episodes of AF. Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of atrial fibrillation are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, the patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for 1 to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of irregular heartbeats or symptoms possibly caused by AF. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later. Other tests: High blood pressure and signs of heart failure can be ascertained (determined) during a physical examination of the patient. Blood tests are performed to detect abnormalities in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, electrolytes, and thyroid hormone levels. Chest X-rays reveal enlargement of the heart, heart failure, and other diseases of the lung. Exercise treadmill testing (a continuous recording of the EKG during exercise) is a useful screening study for detecting severe coronary disease in a doctor's office or hospital."
What are the treatment guidelines for atrial fibrillation?,"'The treatment of atrial fibrillation is multi-faceted and involves:''However, each individual is unique, so the treatments vary depending on the patient’s medical condition (for example, presence of a pacemaker or compromised renal function). Those interested can see the extensive guidelines for various patients in the American Heart Association Journal, ''Circulation'', published in 2019; these may change as new methods and ''drugs'' are approved in the future.''An important first step in the treatment of AF is to uncover and correct health conditions (such as ''hyperthyroidism'' or use of stimulant drugs) that can cause the disease. These steps include:'   Reversing the factors that cause atrial fibrillation. Slowing the heart rate with medications. Preventing strokes. Converting atrial fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm with medications or electrical shock. Preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation with medications. Using procedures (for example, pacemakers, defibrillators, surgery) to prevent episodes of the disease. Stopping the use of stimulant drugs and excessive alcohol intake Controlling high blood pressure Correcting hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) and low blood oxygen levels Controlling cardiac failure and treating the diseases of the heart and the lungs that can cause atrial fibrillation"
Drugs that slow the heart rate,"'Having excluded or corrected the factors that cause the disease, the next step when the ventricles are beating too rapidly usually is to slow the rate at which the ventricles beat.''A person with the disease and healthy AV nodes usually has ventricles that beat rapidly. Drugs are necessary to slow down the rapid heart rate. Drugs to slow the heart rate include:''These medications slow the heart rate by retarding conduction of the electrical discharges through the AV node. These medications, however, do not usually convert AFib back into a normal rhythm. Other drugs or treatments are necessary to achieve a normal heart rhythm and improve health.''Benefits of controlling the rate:'"" In patients with rapid ventricle contractions as a result of the disease, slowing the rate of ventricular contractions improves the heart's efficiency in delivering blood (by allowing more time between contractions for the ventricles to fill with blood) and relieves the symptoms of inadequate flow of blood -- dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath.""'With chronic, sustained disease, doctors may decide to leave some patients in atrial fibrillation if their heart rates are under control, the output of blood from the ventricles is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned to prevent strokes. This form of treatment is called rate control therapy (discussed in this article).''Limitations of medications for controlling the heart rate:'' In people with diseased AV nodes, ventricular contractions may be slower than in those who have normal AV nodes. Moreover, some elderly individuals with atrial fibrillation are extremely sensitive to medications that slow the rate of ventricular contractions, usually because of a diseased AV node. In these patients, the heart rate can become dangerously slow with small doses of medications to slow the heart. This condition is referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, or ""sick sinus syndrome."" Patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome need medications to control the fast heart rate and a pacemaker to provide a minimum safe rate.''Drugs used in slowing atrial fibrillation generally cannot convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. Therefore, these patients are at risk for the formation of blood clots in the heart and strokes, and will need prolonged blood thinning with ''anticoagulants'' like ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'').'   digitalis (Digoxin) Beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), esmolol (Brevibloc) Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Calan), diltiazem (Cardizem)"
Risks and candidates for cardioversion,"'The complications of cardioversion include ''stroke'', ''burns'' of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these problems are very uncommon.''Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion. Cardioversion usually is attempted with drugs first. If medications fail, electrical cardioversion can be considered. Sometimes a doctor may choose to use electrical cardioversion first if AF is of short duration (onset within 48 hours) and the transesophageal echocardiography shows no blood clots in the atria.''Cardioversion is performed urgently (on an emergency basis) on patients with severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms caused by AFib. For example, some patients with rapid AF can develop chest ''pain'', shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting. (Chest ''pain'' in these patients is due to an insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscles. Shortness of breath indicates ineffective pumping of blood by the ventricles. Fainting or dizziness usually is due to dangerously ''low blood pressure''.)''Recent studies have shown that an acceptable alternative to cardioversion (chemical or electrical) is rate-control therapy. In this therapy, the doctor will leave the patients in AF provided their rate of ventricular contractions is under good control, the output of blood from the heart is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned by warfarin to prevent strokes. Heart rate in these patients can be controlled using medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin or AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation. Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).''Over long periods of observation, patients treated with rate-control therapy have similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.''Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:' People who have had atrial fibrillation for more than one year Individuals with significant disease of the heart valves People with enlarged hearts as a result of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) Patients with significant or intolerable side effects with drugs used for the condition."
Cardioversion with medications,"'Before prescribing medications for cardioversion, the doctor usually controls the rate of ventricular contractions and thins the blood, usually with warfarin.''Drugs used in cardioversion usually work by blocking the channels in the walls of cells through which ions travel (sodium channels, potassium channels, beta adrenergic channels, and calcium channels). Some examples of these medications include:'""These drugs are capable of converting AFib to normal rhythm in about 50% of patients. They often are used long term to maintain a normal rhythm, and prevent recurrences of AFib, and increase the person's health.""'Drugs used for converting atrial fibrillation carry a small risk of causing other ''abnormal heart rhythms'"" -- they are said to be proarrhythmic -- especially in patients with diseases of the heart muscle or coronary arteries. These abnormal heart rhythms can be more life threatening than atrial fibrillation. Therefore, treatment with these medications often is initiated in the hospital while the patient's rhythm is continuously monitored for 24 to 72 hours.""'These medications may not be effective in the longer term. Many patients eventually develop a recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite the medications.''Drugs used in treating atrial fibrillation often have important side effects. Many patients discontinue them because they cannot tolerate these side effects. For example:''The most severe side effect of amiodarone is lung toxicity that potentially can be fatal. Because of this lung toxicity, patients should report any symptoms of ''cough'', ''fever'', or painful ''breathing'' to their doctors.' quinidine (Quinaglute) -- rarely used procainamide (Procan SR) -- rarely used disopyramide (Norpace) -- rarely used sotalol (Betapace) flecainide (Tambocor) amiodarone (Cordarone) Amiodarone commonly is used to treat atrial fibrillation because it is less proarrhythmic, and has been shown to maintain a normal rhythm in up to 75% of patients. However, amiodarone may cause side effects and drug interactions. Amiodarone can interact with other medications such as tricyclic antidepressants -- for example, amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep) -- or phenothiazine antipsychotics -- for example, chlorpromazine (Thorazine) -- and cause abnormal heart rhythms. Amiodarone interacts with warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and increases the risk of bleeding, which can occur as early as 4 to 6 days after the start of both drugs, or can be delayed by a few weeks. Thus, doctors prescribing both warfarin and amiodarone will adjust the dose of warfarin to avoid excessive blood thinning. Amiodarone also can cause thyroid disturbances in the fetus when administered orally to the mother during pregnancy. Amiodarone also may affect thyroid function in adults."
What is electrical cardioversion?,"'Other methods of converting AFib to a normal rhythm include electrical cardioversion and rate control therapy.''Electrical cardioversion is a procedure used by doctors to convert an abnormal rhythm (such as AFib) to a normal rhythm (sinus rhythm). Electrical cardioversion requires the administration of an electrical shock over the chest. This electrical shock stops the abnormal electrical activity of the heart for a brief moment and allows the normal rhythm to take over. Although electrical cardioversion can be used to treat almost any abnormal fast heartbeat (such as ''atrial flutter'' and ventricular tachycardia), it is used most frequently to convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm.''Warfarin usually is given for 3 to 4 weeks prior to cardioversion to minimize the risk of ''stroke'' that can occur during or shortly after cardioversion. Warfarin is continued for 4 to 6 weeks after successful cardioversion. For some patients requiring urgent electrical cardioversion, warfarin may not work fast enough to thin the blood. Therefore, these patients may be given ''heparin'' prior to electrical cardioversion. Heparin is a faster-acting blood thinner than warfarin, but it must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion or as injections under the skin. After successful cardioversion, these patients can be switched from heparin to warfarin.''Method of cardioversion''Electrical cardioversions (urgent and elective) usually are performed in a hospital. For elective (nonurgent) electrical cardioversion, patients usually arrive at the hospital without eating in the morning. Necessary medications can be taken with small sips of water. Patients are given supplemental oxygen via nasal catheters, and an intravenous infusion of fluids is started. Electrodes (pads) are placed on the skin over the chest, which continuously monitors the heart rhythm. Paddles then are placed over the chest and the upper back. Patients are sedated (anesthetized) intravenously with medication, which is followed by a strong electric shock through the paddles. The shock converts the atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. After cardioversion, patients are observed for several hours or overnight to make sure that their normal heart rhythm is stable.''Effectiveness of electrical cardioversion''Electrical cardioversion is more effective than medications alone in terminating atrial fibrillation and restoring a normal rhythm. Electrical cardioversion successfully restores a normal rhythm in over 95% of patients.''Limitations of electrical cardioversion''While electrical cardioversion is effective in converting AFib to a normal heart rhythm, the normal rhythm may not continue for long. Approximately 75% of patients successfully treated with electrical cardioversion experience a recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 12 to 24 months. Older patients with enlarged atria and ventricles who have had atrial fibrillation for a long time are especially prone to recurrences. Thus, most patients who undergo successful cardioversion are placed on oral medications to prevent recurrences of the arrhythmia.' "

Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).''Over long periods of observation, individuals treated with rate-control therapy had similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.''Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:' Patients who have had atrial fibrillation for more than one year Patients with significant disease of the heart valves Patients with enlarged hearts as a result of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) Patients with significant or intolerable side effects with medications for atrial fibrillation"
Newer medications to prevent stroke,"'Newer antithrombotic medial agents that are as effective as warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation and that do not require such intense monitoring or dietary restrictions include:''These antithrombotic drugs work by a different mechanism from warfarin and are suitable for many, but not all, patients. Discuss possible use of these medications with your doctor.''Converting to a normal rhythm can be accomplished with medications (chemical cardioversion) or by electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion). Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic sustained AFib undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion, chemical or electrical. Successful cardioversion can alleviate symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve quality of life, and lower the risk of strokes. Doctors usually attempt medical cardioversion first, and, if medications fail, then try electrical cardioversion.''Patients who are more likely to attain and maintain a normal rhythm with either chemical or electrical cardioversion include patients:' rivaroxaban (Xarelto) apixaban (Eliquis) dabigatran (Pradaxa) Younger than 65 years of age Who have had the disease for a short time (less than 12 months) With normal-sized atria and ventricles Who are having their first episode of AF"
Procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'After successful cardioversion, many patients (up to 75%) may experience recurrence of AFib within 12 months. Therefore, many patients will need long-term treatment with medications to prevent a recurrence of the disease; however, medication(s) are effective only 50% to 75% of the time in preventing recurrence. Moreover, many people cannot tolerate the side effects of long-term medication. For these reasons, several procedures have been developed to treat and prevent recurrence of the condition to return the person to good health; they include:''Ablation of the AV node is a procedure that destroys the AV node so that the atrial electrical discharges cannot pass through the AV node to activate the ventricles. The procedure usually is performed in a ''cardiac catheterization'' unit or an electrophysiology unit of a hospital.'   Ablation of the AV node with implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of an atrial defibrillator Maze procedure Procedure: For ablation of the AV node, individuals are given a local anesthetic to minimize pain and are mildly sedated with intravenous medications. Using X-ray guidance, a wire (catheter) is inserted through a vein in the groin to reach the heart. Electrical recordings from inside the heart help to locate the AV node. The AV node is destroyed (ablated) using heat delivered by the catheter. After successful ablation of the AV node, electrical discharges from the atria can no longer reach the ventricles. Destruction of the AV node (whether by catheter ablation or by disease that occurs with age) can lead to an excessively slow rate of ventricular contractions (slow heart rate). Therefore, a pacemaker is implanted in order to provide the heart with a minimum safe heart rate. Benefits of ablation of the AV node: The benefits of ablation of the AV node and implantation of a pacemaker include:Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate)Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breathAbility to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate) Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breath Ability to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Risks of ablation of the AV node: Potential complications of ablation of the AV node and permanent implantation of a pacemaker include bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall, and death. Still, this technique has helped many patients with severe symptoms to live normally. Candidates for ablation of the AV node: Candidates for ablation of the AV node are patients with AF who respond poorly to both chemical and electrical cardioversion. These patients experience repeated relapses of atrial fibrillation, often with rapid rates of ventricular contractions despite medications. Ablation also may be an option for patients who develop serious side effects from the medications that are used for treating and preventing AF. Limitations of ablation of the AV node: Ablation of the AV node only controls the rate with which the ventricles beat. It does not convert AF to normal rhythm. Therefore, blood clots still can form in the atria and patients are still at risk for strokes. Thus, there is a need for long-term anticoagulation in addition to the permanent pacemaker."
Other procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'Permanent pacemakers are battery-operated devices that generate electrical discharges that cause the heart to beat more rapidly when the heart is beating too slowly. Recent studies suggest that some patients with recurrent paroxysmal AFib can benefit from the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Although the reasons for this benefit are unknown, regular electrical pulses from the pacemakers may prevent the recurrence of AFib. Furthermore, newer pacemakers that can stimulate two different sites within the atria (dual site atrial pacing) may be even more effective than standard pacemakers in preventing AFib. Nevertheless, permanent pacemaker implantation cannot be considered as standard non-medication treatment for atrial fibrillation.''Implantable atrial defibrillators can detect and convert atrial fibrillation back to a normal rhythm by using high-energy shocks. By detecting atrial fibrillation and terminating it quickly, doctors hope that these devices will prevent recurrences of AFib over the long term.''Atrial defibrillators are surgically implanted within the chest under local anesthesia. These devices deliver high-energy shocks to the heart that are somewhat painful. Atrial defibrillators are not useful in patients with chronic sustained atrial fibrillation and are suitable only for patients with infrequent episodic attacks of AFib.''Many doctors believe that the atria cannot fibrillate if they are sectioned into small pieces so that the conduction of the electrical current through the atria is interrupted. During the Maze procedure, numerous incisions are made in the atria to control the irregular heartbeat and restore a regular rhythm.' Procedure: The Maze procedure is most commonly performed via open-heart surgery. Some electrophysiologists (doctors specially trained to treat abnormalities of rhythm) are now attempting to perform the Maze procedure using catheters inside the heart that are passed through a vein in the groin without open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, the success rate using the catheter is below 50% and complications (such as strokes) may occur. Effectiveness of the Maze procedure: The Maze procedure done surgically (using open-heart surgery) has been reported to correct atrial fibrillation in 90% to 99% of patients. Only 15% to 20% of the patients need a pacemaker after surgery, and there is only a 30% chance of requiring long-term medications to maintain a normal rhythm. Risks of the Maze procedure: The surgical Maze procedure involves open-heart surgery and the pumping of blood by an external bypass pump while the surgery is performed, much like patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. The complications are not insignificant and include stroke, bleeding, infection, and death. Therefore, doctors usually do not recommend a surgical Maze procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation unless the patient is undergoing open-heart surgery for another condition (such as for coronary artery bypass or replacement or repair of a diseased heart valve)."
What are the complications of atrial fibrillation?,"'Heart failure:'' If the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of blood to the body, as in some people with atrial fibrillation, the body begins to compensate by retaining fluid. This can lead to a condition called heart failure. Heart failure results in the accumulation of fluid in the lower legs (''edema'') and the lungs (''pulmonary edema''). Pulmonary edema makes breathing more difficult and reduces the ability of the lung to add oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The levels of oxygen in the blood can drop, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood can increase, a complication called respiratory failure. This is a life-threatening complication. In patients with underlying ''heart disease'', the development of AFib may result in up to a 25% decrease in the pumping function of the heart.''Stroke:'' Quivering of the atria in atrial fibrillation causes blood inside the atria to stagnate. Stagnant blood tends to form blood clots along the walls of the atria. Sometimes, these blood clots dislodge, pass through the ventricles, and lodge in the brain, lungs, and other parts of the body. This process is called embolization. One common complication of AFib is a ''blood clot'' that travels to the brain and causes the sudden onset of one-sided ''paralysis'' of the extremities and/or the facial muscles (an embolic stroke). A ''blood clot'"" that travels to the lungs can cause injury to the lung tissues (pulmonary infarction), and symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. When blood clots travel to the body's extremities, ""'cold hands'', ''feet'', or legs may occur suddenly because of the lack of blood.'  "
What is pulmonary vein isolation?,"'The four pulmonary veins are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. There is a narrow band of muscle cells that surrounds the openings of the pulmonary veins where they enter the left atrium. This band of muscle cells may begin to actively discharge electrically, and this discharge may initiate atrial fibrillation. During pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the band of muscle cells is destroyed by energy applied through a catheter. This effectively blocks the electrical discharges from crossing over from the band to the left atrium and, hence, prevents atrial fibrillation.''Before PVI, the doctor performs a history and physical examination, an EKG, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and a transesophageal ''echocardiogram'' to exclude blood clots in the atria, and, sometimes, a CAT scan of the chest. The doctor also may ask the person to stop certain medications, particularly blood thinners such as ''aspirin'', clopidogrel (''Plavix''), or warfarin, several days before the procedure. The doctor may check a blood prothrombin time and INR level to make sure that blood clotting is adequate for the procedure.''PVI is usually performed under deep conscious sedation (but occasionally general anesthesia) in a cardiac electrophysiology laboratory and takes 3 to 6 hours. Several catheters are inserted through large veins (in the neck, arm, or groin) and fed into the left atrium under X-ray (fluoroscopy) guidance. One of the catheters is equipped with an ultrasound transducer that allows the doctor to view the structures inside the heart during the procedure. The junction of the pulmonary veins with the left atrium is identified, and energy is then applied through another catheter to this area. This results in the destruction of the band of muscle cells and their replacement by a ''scar''. This process is repeated at the opening of each of the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium.''Course after pulmonary vein isolation:'"" After PVI, patients remain in the hospital telemetry unit so that the heart's rhythm can be monitored.""'Many patients will experience AFib and palpitations (irregular heartbeat) while in the hospital and during the first 2 or 3 months following PVI. Therefore, they are given medications such as amiodarone to prevent episodes of AFib and anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin to prevent strokes. The palpitations and episodes of AFib gradually decrease. By 3 months after the procedure, the majority of patients will have a normal rhythm, return to good health, and the doctor may stop warfarin and amiodarone.''Patients usually will have an EKG and a CAT scan of the chest 3 months after PVI. The CAT scan is done to make sure that there is no narrowing of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein stenosis) due to the scarring.''Effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation: ''PVI in the U.S. is a relatively new procedure. When performed by experienced doctors, PVI can be expected to prevent AFib in 70% to 80% of patients during the first year. Some patients may need additional PVI procedures to prevent further atrial fibrillation episodes. Because this procedure is new, it is difficult to know whether successfully treated patients will continue in a normal rhythm for a prolonged period.' "
"Who are candidates for PVI, and what are the risks?","'Generally, good candidates for PVI include:''When performed by doctors experienced in PVI, the procedure is safe. The risks of pulmonary vein isolation include cardiac tamponade (bleeding into the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart), narrowing of the openings of the pulmonary veins, injury to the phrenic nerve that controls the function of the ''diaphragm'', injury to peripheral blood vessels, and, in rare cases, death.''In the early years of PVI, doctors were trying to destroy the tissues inside the pulmonary veins. This led to narrowing (due to scarring) of the pulmonary veins, which in turn led to ''pulmonary hypertension'', a condition in which the ''blood pressure'' in the pulmonary veins and arteries increases. ''Pulmonary hypertension'' is a serious condition that can lead to congestive heart failure and even death. Doctors no longer try to destroy tissue inside the pulmonary veins. Instead, they try to destroy the tissues only at the junction of the pulmonary veins and the atria. The current technique is not only safer, but is more effective and simpler.'

What is the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare)?,"""This was adapted from an Apr. 24, 2013, discussion with Kyle Lee, a consultant in health-care reform with MedTrack, Inc., of Springfield, MO. What follows are Mr. Lee's concepts of the future health-care landscape as he relayed them to me. --""' William C. Shiel Jr. MD, FACP, FACR''The entire health-care industry is poised for the most profound changes in several generations. These changes can be categorized into Market Changes and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While the ACA is the most visible and most talked about driver of change, there are also numerous, less conspicuous factors that are already altering the way care is delivered and how it is paid for.''The ultimate decision supported by the 2012 presidential election is that the ACA will be the ""rule of the land"" and its continued evolutions have put additional stresses on providers of every discipline and size. Namely, providers of health care can expect the following changes:' Medicare volumes: The ACA will reduce payments to providers by $741 billion, of which $300 billion will be in Medicare and Medicaid cuts directly impacting hospitals. In reaction, providers must decide how to limit Medicare patient volumes, find efficiencies in the treatment of Medicare volumes, or eliminate chosen services to Medicare patients all together. Expense reduction: As revenues are further jeopardized, providers must look closer at controllable expenditures and question the return on dollars spent. Providers must consider the ""value gap"" as well -- where cost increases have outpaced the increases of quality of care. Stakeholders are demanding better quality at lower costs and providers must respond accordingly. Operational efficiency: In response to reductions in revenue and expenses, providers must improve outcomes, reduce redundancies, and find alternative delivery models to treat patients in more economical manners with minimal or no sacrificing of patient outcomes. Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB): One of the most highly publicized sources of the ACA's potential economic impact is the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the 15-member board of unelected health-care experts designed to provide Congress with cost-cutting recommendations when Medicare spending hits a certain level. The IPAB, a panel of nonelected health-care experts, became the bogeyman of the ACA in 2009 when Sarah Palin touted the IPAB as the ""death panel."" The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects IPAB will save Medicare $16 billion over 10 years and, by necessity, a subset of providers would receive the brunt of the cuts. IPAB is not permitted to recommend changes to beneficiary premiums, cost-sharing, or eligibility rules. It cannot recommend a reduction to Medicare benefits, an increase in taxes, or any reductions to payments to some providers. This leaves other providers -- Medicare part C; Medicare prescription drug plans (part D); skilled nursing facilities; home health, dialysis, ambulance, and ambulatory surgical center services; and durable medical equipment providers -- particularly vulnerable."
What are the major changes to medical insurance? How does the ACA affect Medicare?,"'Numerous other factors that are placing ''stress'' on health-care providers began prior to the ACA and remain an integral portion of reform. These include the following:''As the landscape changes, some of the key provisions that affect beneficiaries are as follows:' Value-based purchasing (VBP): VBP has its roots back in 2006 when Pay for Performance began. Today, as a cornerstone of health-care reform, VBP has evolved from simply reporting standards of care to providers' payments hinging upon quality. This involves a greater emphasis on primary and preventative care, greater attention to standardization of care, and greater patient participation in high-value health-care decisions. Changes in physician compensation models: In reaction to the emphasis on value and quality, institutions will be required to invest significantly in clinical decision support systems and realign their physician compensation to create incentives based on the value of care. We have already seen signs of this. For example, a 2012 New York Times article reported that, for the first time ever, NYC public hospitals will begin to link physician compensation to patient outcomes. Starting in 2015, Medicare will tie some physician payment to quality outcomes; however, most or all Medicare physician payments will be tied to quality outcomes in 2017. Mergers, acquisitions, and partners: Hospitals, physicians, and payers are all looking at the change in landscape in the marketplace, and questions of economies of scale emerge. Some providers need more advanced infrastructure to monitor and report quality initiatives while others have identified that making competitors partners or bringing complimentary services in house make good business sense in the current and future environment. Smaller providers are especially looking to become a part of systems with deeper pockets, and the independent physician practice will be virtually nonexistent in the future models. Ultimately, integration will be the key among significant players to provide superior care and create the operational efficiencies needed for organizations to continue moving forward. Commercial payers: As demonstrated in years past, commercial payers will adopt Medicare rules, especially when savings in payments or increases in quality can be realized. It is estimated that 5% of commercial payers have quality measures tied to payment today. In a survey conducted by Healthcare Financial Management Association, 80% of the respondents expect the commercial payers' payments to include at least some value-based payment mechanism within three to five years. Higher income tax: There will be a 0.9% tax to high-income workers who make more than $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. The ACA also includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers. Medicare beneficiaries will ultimately pay more for part B premiums: The ACA freezes the part B income thresholds at 2010 levels. These thresholds determine which beneficiaries will pay higher Medicare medical insurance (part B) premiums through 2019. The new provisions will increase the number and share of beneficiaries who pay the higher premium over time, while the percentage of beneficiaries who pay the higher premiums will increase from 5% in 2011 to 14% in 2019, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Mergers, acquisitions, and partners: As hospitals, physicians, and payers respond to changes and form collective efforts, objections begin to surface in fear of monopolies. According to the New York Times profiled instances in which a consolidation created higher prices or resulted in less autonomy for physicians. A Nov. 2012 report by catalyst for payment reform argued that increased provider consolidations would create monopolies, driving cost increases and higher unit prices across the board. The Federal Trade Commission is on alert, however, and can challenge and block health system mergers that it believes would stifle competition. In the 2012 fiscal year, the FTC blocked 17 proposed health-care merger, acquisitions, or partnerships."
What are the benefits of the Affordable Care Act?,"'In response to these changes, hospital, health systems, and physicians will need greater emphasis on primary and preventative care, greater attention to standardization of care, and greater patient participation in high-value health-care decisions. This will require significant investment in clinical decisions support systems, realignment of the physician compensation models to create appropriate incentives as insurance requirements, and system-wide changes in patient management.'""Cost containment is vital and focus must be on where drivers are, namely chronic conditions, implantable devices, and pharmaceuticals. Forward-thinking organizations must look to decisions around cost containment and ultimately closing the value gap. It would appear, though, that closing the value gap is generally concentrating on one side of the equation. Providers overwhelmingly aim for their organizations' reputations to be based on high quality and patient satisfaction. Providers do not seek to be known as the low-cost provider in today's health-care environment.""""Ultimately, the ACA's goal is to increase the quality of health-care delivered as well as increase coverage to the uninsured. It is also the intent of the ACA and the other market drivers to sustain the Medicare program financially. As of May 31, 2013, it was estimated by the program's trustees that Medicare will be sustained until 2026, two additional years from previous estimates.""'Though the implementation of the ACA is in phases, the most significant reimbursement impacts to providers will begin in Oct. 2013 with changes in the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program. Providers have begun to react, however, in preparation for the changes on the horizon.''Editorial note by Charles P. Davis, MD, PhD''There are many specific questions that remain about the true cost and true benefits to those who provide and to those who need health care. Some of these questions are inferred by this general article. The answers to these questions should begin to come as each ACA phase quickly matures. If the ACA phase enhances the health care of most individuals without damaging the health-care system, ACA and its phase may be deemed a success. However, if ACA damages the health care of many individuals (for example, provides limited access to physicians, creates long waits for diagnostic tests, medical ''drugs'' become scarce commodities, or patients have poor health-care experiences) or damages the health-care system (for example, fewer doctors, a decline in the quality of medical-school applicants, spiraling costs, and hospital and emergency department closures), the ACA or that ACA phase will be considered a failure. That ACA phase will require quick and effective revision if quality health care is to survive and advance in the U.S. Many potential patients, doctors, and health-care professionals are concerned that provisions in the ACA may not be appropriately amenable to revisions if problems develop.''The ACA is 974 pages long and divided into 10 sections. While short summaries are useful to obtain some general understanding of this massive change in health care, for a more complete grasp of this law, it is best to read all of its details. Readers can find the complete ACA at the following site: ''http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf''.' "
What is atrial fibrillation?,'Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which the electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper atria (chambers) of the heart. Many people with this condition have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). It is the most common supraventricular tachycardia.' 
"What is the normal function of the heart, and how does its electrical system work?","'The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles: 1) the ''right atrium'' (upper right); 2) the ''left atrium'' (upper left); 3) the ''right ventricle'' (lower right); and 4) the ''left ventricle'' (lower left).''Blood returning to the heart from the body contains low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. This blood flows into the right ''atrium'' and then down into the adjacent right ventricle. After the right ventricle fills, contraction of the right ''atrium'' pumps additional blood into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the ''lungs'' where the blood takes up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The blood then flows from the lungs to the left atrium, and then down into the adjacent left ventricle. Contraction of the left atrium pumps additional blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the aortic artery and then to the rest of the body via the vascular system.''The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles. The ventricles must deliver enough blood to the body for the body to function normally. The amount of blood that is pumped depends on several factors. The most important factor is the rate of contraction of the heart (the heart rate). As the rate increases, more blood is pumped. The heart pumps more blood with each beat when the atria contract and fill the ventricles with additional blood just before the ventricles contract.''With each beat of the heart, an electrical discharge (current) passes through the electrical system of the heart. This discharge causes the muscle of the atria and ventricles to contract and pump blood.''The electrical system of the heart consists of the SA node (sinoatrial node), the ''AV node'' (''atrioventricular node''), and special tissues in the atria and the ventricles that conduct the current.''The electrical discharges from the SA node cause the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The same discharges then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, traveling through the special tissues of the ventricles and causing the ventricles to contract. In a normal heart, the rate of atrial contraction is the same as the rate of ventricular contraction.''At rest, the frequency of the discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate in individuals who are in good clinical health.' The SA node is the heart's electrical pacemaker. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the right atrium; the frequency with which the SA node discharges determines the rate at which the heart beats. The current passes from the SA node, through the special tissues of the atria and into the AV node. The AV node serves as a relay station between the atria and the ventricles. Signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles."
What causes atrial fibrillation?,"'The cause of atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm. During this rhythm, electrical discharges are not generated solely by the SA node. Instead, discharges come from other parts of the atria. These abnormal discharges are rapid and irregular and may exceed 350 discharges per minute. The rapid and irregular discharges cause ineffective contractions of the atria. In fact, the atria quiver rather than beat as a unit. This reduces the ability of the atria to pump blood into the ventricles.''The rapid and irregular discharges from the atria then pass through the AV node and into the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The contractions of the ventricles may average 150/minute, much slower than the rate in the atria. (The ventricles are unable to contract at 350/minute.) Even at an average rate of 150/minute, the ventricles may not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before the next contraction, particularly without the normal contraction of the atria. Thus, AFib decreases the amount of blood pumped by the ventricles because of their rapid rate of contraction and the absence of normal atrial contractions.' "
What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,"'Many patients with this condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and are unaware of the abnormal rhythm. When symptoms do occur, the most common one is heart ''palpitations'', an uncomfortable awareness of the rapid and irregular heartbeat. Other symptoms of the condition are caused by the diminished delivery of blood to the body. These symptoms include:''In a heart that is beating normally, the rate of ventricular contraction is the same as the rate of atrial contraction. In atrial fibrillation, however, the rate of ventricular contraction is less than the rate of atrial contraction. The rate of ventricular contraction in the condition is determined by the speed of transmission of the discharges through the AV node. In people with a normal AV node, the rate of ventricular contraction in untreated disease usually ranges from 80 to 180 beats/minute; the higher the transmission, the higher the heart rate.''Some older people have slow transmission through the AV node due to disease within the AV node. When these people develop the problem, their heart rates remain normal or slower than normal. As disease in the AV node advances, these people can even develop an excessively slow heart rate and require a permanent pacemaker to increase the rate of ventricular contractions.'   Dizziness Fainting Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath Angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles)"
How can I know if I am at risk for developing atrial fibrillation?,"'There are many risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation. They include:''About 1 in 10,000 young adults in otherwise good health have the disease without any apparent cause or underlying cardiac problems. Atrial fibrillation of the heart in these individuals usually is intermittent, but can become chronic in 25%. This condition is referred to as lone AFib. ''Stress'', alcohol, tobacco, or use of ''stimulants'' may play a role in causing this ''arrhythmia''.' Increased age (1% of people over 60 years of age have the disease) Coronary disease (including heart attack) High blood pressure Abnormal heart muscle function (including congestive heart failure) Disease of the mitral valve between the left and right ventricle An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or overdose of thyroid medication Low amounts of oxygen in the blood, for example, as occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart (pericarditis) Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Chronic lung diseases (emphysema, asthma, COPD) Excessive intake of alcohol (alcoholism) Stimulant drug use such as cocaine or decongestants Recent heart or lung surgery Abnormal heart structure from the time of birth (congenital)"
How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?,"'Atrial fibrillation can be chronic and sustained, or brief and intermittent (paroxysmal). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refers to ''intermittent episodes of AF'' lasting, for example, minutes to hours. The rate reverts to normal between episodes. In ''chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation'"", the atria fibrillate all of the time. Chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation is not difficult to diagnose. Doctors can hear the rapid and irregular heartbeats using a stethoscope. Abnormal heartbeats also can be felt by taking a patient's pulse and by a doctor's diagnosis."" EKG (electrocardiogram): An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. The irregular EKG tracings of AF are easy to recognize provided AF occurs during the EKG. Echocardiography: Echocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce images of the chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Conditions that may accompany AF such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic valve diseases, and pericarditis (inflammation of the ""sack"" surrounding the heart) can be detected with echocardiography. Echocardiography also is useful in measuring the size of the atrial chambers. Atrial size is an important factor in determining how a patient responds to treatment for the disease. For instance, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain a normal rhythm in patients with enlarged atria. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a special echocardiographic technique that involves taking pictures of the atria using sound waves. A special probe that generates sound waves is placed in the esophagus (the food pipe connecting the mouth to the stomach). The probe is located at the end of a long flexible tube that is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. This technique brings the probe very close to the heart (which lies just in front of the esophagus). Sound waves generated by the probe are bounced off the structures within the heart, and the reflected sound waves are used to form a picture of the heart. TEE is very accurate for detecting blood clots in the atria as well as for measuring the size of the atria. Holter monitor: If episodes of the disease occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show AF. Therefore, a Holter monitor, a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours, often is used to diagnose intermittent episodes of AF. Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of atrial fibrillation are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, the patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for 1 to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of irregular heartbeats or symptoms possibly caused by AF. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later. Other tests: High blood pressure and signs of heart failure can be ascertained (determined) during a physical examination of the patient. Blood tests are performed to detect abnormalities in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, electrolytes, and thyroid hormone levels. Chest X-rays reveal enlargement of the heart, heart failure, and other diseases of the lung. Exercise treadmill testing (a continuous recording of the EKG during exercise) is a useful screening study for detecting severe coronary disease in a doctor's office or hospital."
What are the treatment guidelines for atrial fibrillation?,"'The treatment of atrial fibrillation is multi-faceted and involves:''However, each individual is unique, so the treatments vary depending on the patient’s medical condition (for example, presence of a pacemaker or compromised renal function). Those interested can see the extensive guidelines for various patients in the American Heart Association Journal, ''Circulation'', published in 2019; these may change as new methods and ''drugs'' are approved in the future.''An important first step in the treatment of AF is to uncover and correct health conditions (such as ''hyperthyroidism'' or use of stimulant drugs) that can cause the disease. These steps include:'   Reversing the factors that cause atrial fibrillation. Slowing the heart rate with medications. Preventing strokes. Converting atrial fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm with medications or electrical shock. Preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation with medications. Using procedures (for example, pacemakers, defibrillators, surgery) to prevent episodes of the disease. Stopping the use of stimulant drugs and excessive alcohol intake Controlling high blood pressure Correcting hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) and low blood oxygen levels Controlling cardiac failure and treating the diseases of the heart and the lungs that can cause atrial fibrillation"
Drugs that slow the heart rate,"'Having excluded or corrected the factors that cause the disease, the next step when the ventricles are beating too rapidly usually is to slow the rate at which the ventricles beat.''A person with the disease and healthy AV nodes usually has ventricles that beat rapidly. Drugs are necessary to slow down the rapid heart rate. Drugs to slow the heart rate include:''These medications slow the heart rate by retarding conduction of the electrical discharges through the AV node. These medications, however, do not usually convert AFib back into a normal rhythm. Other drugs or treatments are necessary to achieve a normal heart rhythm and improve health.''Benefits of controlling the rate:'"" In patients with rapid ventricle contractions as a result of the disease, slowing the rate of ventricular contractions improves the heart's efficiency in delivering blood (by allowing more time between contractions for the ventricles to fill with blood) and relieves the symptoms of inadequate flow of blood -- dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath.""'With chronic, sustained disease, doctors may decide to leave some patients in atrial fibrillation if their heart rates are under control, the output of blood from the ventricles is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned to prevent strokes. This form of treatment is called rate control therapy (discussed in this article).''Limitations of medications for controlling the heart rate:'' In people with diseased AV nodes, ventricular contractions may be slower than in those who have normal AV nodes. Moreover, some elderly individuals with atrial fibrillation are extremely sensitive to medications that slow the rate of ventricular contractions, usually because of a diseased AV node. In these patients, the heart rate can become dangerously slow with small doses of medications to slow the heart. This condition is referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, or ""sick sinus syndrome."" Patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome need medications to control the fast heart rate and a pacemaker to provide a minimum safe rate.''Drugs used in slowing atrial fibrillation generally cannot convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. Therefore, these patients are at risk for the formation of blood clots in the heart and strokes, and will need prolonged blood thinning with ''anticoagulants'' like ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'').'   digitalis (Digoxin) Beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), esmolol (Brevibloc) Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Calan), diltiazem (Cardizem)"
Risks and candidates for cardioversion,"'The complications of cardioversion include ''stroke'', ''burns'' of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these problems are very uncommon.''Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion. Cardioversion usually is attempted with drugs first. If medications fail, electrical cardioversion can be considered. Sometimes a doctor may choose to use electrical cardioversion first if AF is of short duration (onset within 48 hours) and the transesophageal echocardiography shows no blood clots in the atria.''Cardioversion is performed urgently (on an emergency basis) on patients with severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms caused by AFib. For example, some patients with rapid AF can develop chest ''pain'', shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting. (Chest ''pain'' in these patients is due to an insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscles. Shortness of breath indicates ineffective pumping of blood by the ventricles. Fainting or dizziness usually is due to dangerously ''low blood pressure''.)''Recent studies have shown that an acceptable alternative to cardioversion (chemical or electrical) is rate-control therapy. In this therapy, the doctor will leave the patients in AF provided their rate of ventricular contractions is under good control, the output of blood from the heart is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned by warfarin to prevent strokes. Heart rate in these patients can be controlled using medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin or AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation. Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).''Over long periods of observation, patients treated with rate-control therapy have similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.''Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:' People who have had atrial fibrillation for more than one year Individuals with significant disease of the heart valves People with enlarged hearts as a result of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) Patients with significant or intolerable side effects with drugs used for the condition."
Cardioversion with medications,"'Before prescribing medications for cardioversion, the doctor usually controls the rate of ventricular contractions and thins the blood, usually with warfarin.''Drugs used in cardioversion usually work by blocking the channels in the walls of cells through which ions travel (sodium channels, potassium channels, beta adrenergic channels, and calcium channels). Some examples of these medications include:'""These drugs are capable of converting AFib to normal rhythm in about 50% of patients. They often are used long term to maintain a normal rhythm, and prevent recurrences of AFib, and increase the person's health.""'Drugs used for converting atrial fibrillation carry a small risk of causing other ''abnormal heart rhythms'"" -- they are said to be proarrhythmic -- especially in patients with diseases of the heart muscle or coronary arteries. These abnormal heart rhythms can be more life threatening than atrial fibrillation. Therefore, treatment with these medications often is initiated in the hospital while the patient's rhythm is continuously monitored for 24 to 72 hours.""'These medications may not be effective in the longer term. Many patients eventually develop a recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite the medications.''Drugs used in treating atrial fibrillation often have important side effects. Many patients discontinue them because they cannot tolerate these side effects. For example:''The most severe side effect of amiodarone is lung toxicity that potentially can be fatal. Because of this lung toxicity, patients should report any symptoms of ''cough'', ''fever'', or painful ''breathing'' to their doctors.' quinidine (Quinaglute) -- rarely used procainamide (Procan SR) -- rarely used disopyramide (Norpace) -- rarely used sotalol (Betapace) flecainide (Tambocor) amiodarone (Cordarone) Amiodarone commonly is used to treat atrial fibrillation because it is less proarrhythmic, and has been shown to maintain a normal rhythm in up to 75% of patients. However, amiodarone may cause side effects and drug interactions. Amiodarone can interact with other medications such as tricyclic antidepressants -- for example, amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep) -- or phenothiazine antipsychotics -- for example, chlorpromazine (Thorazine) -- and cause abnormal heart rhythms. Amiodarone interacts with warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and increases the risk of bleeding, which can occur as early as 4 to 6 days after the start of both drugs, or can be delayed by a few weeks. Thus, doctors prescribing both warfarin and amiodarone will adjust the dose of warfarin to avoid excessive blood thinning. Amiodarone also can cause thyroid disturbances in the fetus when administered orally to the mother during pregnancy. Amiodarone also may affect thyroid function in adults."
What is electrical cardioversion?,"'Other methods of converting AFib to a normal rhythm include electrical cardioversion and rate control therapy.''Electrical cardioversion is a procedure used by doctors to convert an abnormal rhythm (such as AFib) to a normal rhythm (sinus rhythm). Electrical cardioversion requires the administration of an electrical shock over the chest. This electrical shock stops the abnormal electrical activity of the heart for a brief moment and allows the normal rhythm to take over. Although electrical cardioversion can be used to treat almost any abnormal fast heartbeat (such as ''atrial flutter'' and ventricular tachycardia), it is used most frequently to convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm.''Warfarin usually is given for 3 to 4 weeks prior to cardioversion to minimize the risk of ''stroke'' that can occur during or shortly after cardioversion. Warfarin is continued for 4 to 6 weeks after successful cardioversion. For some patients requiring urgent electrical cardioversion, warfarin may not work fast enough to thin the blood. Therefore, these patients may be given ''heparin'' prior to electrical cardioversion. Heparin is a faster-acting blood thinner than warfarin, but it must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion or as injections under the skin. After successful cardioversion, these patients can be switched from heparin to warfarin.''Method of cardioversion''Electrical cardioversions (urgent and elective) usually are performed in a hospital. For elective (nonurgent) electrical cardioversion, patients usually arrive at the hospital without eating in the morning. Necessary medications can be taken with small sips of water. Patients are given supplemental oxygen via nasal catheters, and an intravenous infusion of fluids is started. Electrodes (pads) are placed on the skin over the chest, which continuously monitors the heart rhythm. Paddles then are placed over the chest and the upper back. Patients are sedated (anesthetized) intravenously with medication, which is followed by a strong electric shock through the paddles. The shock converts the atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. After cardioversion, patients are observed for several hours or overnight to make sure that their normal heart rhythm is stable.''Effectiveness of electrical cardioversion''Electrical cardioversion is more effective than medications alone in terminating atrial fibrillation and restoring a normal rhythm. Electrical cardioversion successfully restores a normal rhythm in over 95% of patients.''Limitations of electrical cardioversion''While electrical cardioversion is effective in converting AFib to a normal heart rhythm, the normal rhythm may not continue for long. Approximately 75% of patients successfully treated with electrical cardioversion experience a recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 12 to 24 months. Older patients with enlarged atria and ventricles who have had atrial fibrillation for a long time are especially prone to recurrences. Thus, most patients who undergo successful cardioversion are placed on oral medications to prevent recurrences of the arrhythmia.' "
Risks and candidates for electrical cardioversion,"'The risks of electrical cardioversion include ''stroke'', ''burns'' of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these complications are very uncommon.''Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained AF undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion.

Newer medications to prevent stroke,"'Newer antithrombotic medial agents that are as effective as warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation and that do not require such intense monitoring or dietary restrictions include:''These antithrombotic drugs work by a different mechanism from warfarin and are suitable for many, but not all, patients. Discuss possible use of these medications with your doctor.''Converting to a normal rhythm can be accomplished with medications (chemical cardioversion) or by electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion). Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic sustained AFib undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion, chemical or electrical. Successful cardioversion can alleviate symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve quality of life, and lower the risk of strokes. Doctors usually attempt medical cardioversion first, and, if medications fail, then try electrical cardioversion.''Patients who are more likely to attain and maintain a normal rhythm with either chemical or electrical cardioversion include patients:' rivaroxaban (Xarelto) apixaban (Eliquis) dabigatran (Pradaxa) Younger than 65 years of age Who have had the disease for a short time (less than 12 months) With normal-sized atria and ventricles Who are having their first episode of AF"
Procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'After successful cardioversion, many patients (up to 75%) may experience recurrence of AFib within 12 months. Therefore, many patients will need long-term treatment with medications to prevent a recurrence of the disease; however, medication(s) are effective only 50% to 75% of the time in preventing recurrence. Moreover, many people cannot tolerate the side effects of long-term medication. For these reasons, several procedures have been developed to treat and prevent recurrence of the condition to return the person to good health; they include:''Ablation of the AV node is a procedure that destroys the AV node so that the atrial electrical discharges cannot pass through the AV node to activate the ventricles. The procedure usually is performed in a ''cardiac catheterization'' unit or an electrophysiology unit of a hospital.'   Ablation of the AV node with implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of an atrial defibrillator Maze procedure Procedure: For ablation of the AV node, individuals are given a local anesthetic to minimize pain and are mildly sedated with intravenous medications. Using X-ray guidance, a wire (catheter) is inserted through a vein in the groin to reach the heart. Electrical recordings from inside the heart help to locate the AV node. The AV node is destroyed (ablated) using heat delivered by the catheter. After successful ablation of the AV node, electrical discharges from the atria can no longer reach the ventricles. Destruction of the AV node (whether by catheter ablation or by disease that occurs with age) can lead to an excessively slow rate of ventricular contractions (slow heart rate). Therefore, a pacemaker is implanted in order to provide the heart with a minimum safe heart rate. Benefits of ablation of the AV node: The benefits of ablation of the AV node and implantation of a pacemaker include:Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate)Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breathAbility to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate) Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breath Ability to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Risks of ablation of the AV node: Potential complications of ablation of the AV node and permanent implantation of a pacemaker include bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall, and death. Still, this technique has helped many patients with severe symptoms to live normally. Candidates for ablation of the AV node: Candidates for ablation of the AV node are patients with AF who respond poorly to both chemical and electrical cardioversion. These patients experience repeated relapses of atrial fibrillation, often with rapid rates of ventricular contractions despite medications. Ablation also may be an option for patients who develop serious side effects from the medications that are used for treating and preventing AF. Limitations of ablation of the AV node: Ablation of the AV node only controls the rate with which the ventricles beat. It does not convert AF to normal rhythm. Therefore, blood clots still can form in the atria and patients are still at risk for strokes. Thus, there is a need for long-term anticoagulation in addition to the permanent pacemaker."
Other procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'Permanent pacemakers are battery-operated devices that generate electrical discharges that cause the heart to beat more rapidly when the heart is beating too slowly. Recent studies suggest that some patients with recurrent paroxysmal AFib can benefit from the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Although the reasons for this benefit are unknown, regular electrical pulses from the pacemakers may prevent the recurrence of AFib. Furthermore, newer pacemakers that can stimulate two different sites within the atria (dual site atrial pacing) may be even more effective than standard pacemakers in preventing AFib. Nevertheless, permanent pacemaker implantation cannot be considered as standard non-medication treatment for atrial fibrillation.''Implantable atrial defibrillators can detect and convert atrial fibrillation back to a normal rhythm by using high-energy shocks. By detecting atrial fibrillation and terminating it quickly, doctors hope that these devices will prevent recurrences of AFib over the long term.''Atrial defibrillators are surgically implanted within the chest under local anesthesia. These devices deliver high-energy shocks to the heart that are somewhat painful. Atrial defibrillators are not useful in patients with chronic sustained atrial fibrillation and are suitable only for patients with infrequent episodic attacks of AFib.''Many doctors believe that the atria cannot fibrillate if they are sectioned into small pieces so that the conduction of the electrical current through the atria is interrupted. During the Maze procedure, numerous incisions are made in the atria to control the irregular heartbeat and restore a regular rhythm.' Procedure: The Maze procedure is most commonly performed via open-heart surgery. Some electrophysiologists (doctors specially trained to treat abnormalities of rhythm) are now attempting to perform the Maze procedure using catheters inside the heart that are passed through a vein in the groin without open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, the success rate using the catheter is below 50% and complications (such as strokes) may occur. Effectiveness of the Maze procedure: The Maze procedure done surgically (using open-heart surgery) has been reported to correct atrial fibrillation in 90% to 99% of patients. Only 15% to 20% of the patients need a pacemaker after surgery, and there is only a 30% chance of requiring long-term medications to maintain a normal rhythm. Risks of the Maze procedure: The surgical Maze procedure involves open-heart surgery and the pumping of blood by an external bypass pump while the surgery is performed, much like patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. The complications are not insignificant and include stroke, bleeding, infection, and death. Therefore, doctors usually do not recommend a surgical Maze procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation unless the patient is undergoing open-heart surgery for another condition (such as for coronary artery bypass or replacement or repair of a diseased heart valve)."
What are the complications of atrial fibrillation?,"'Heart failure:'' If the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of blood to the body, as in some people with atrial fibrillation, the body begins to compensate by retaining fluid. This can lead to a condition called heart failure. Heart failure results in the accumulation of fluid in the lower legs (''edema'') and the lungs (''pulmonary edema''). Pulmonary edema makes breathing more difficult and reduces the ability of the lung to add oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The levels of oxygen in the blood can drop, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood can increase, a complication called respiratory failure. This is a life-threatening complication. In patients with underlying ''heart disease'', the development of AFib may result in up to a 25% decrease in the pumping function of the heart.''Stroke:'' Quivering of the atria in atrial fibrillation causes blood inside the atria to stagnate. Stagnant blood tends to form blood clots along the walls of the atria. Sometimes, these blood clots dislodge, pass through the ventricles, and lodge in the brain, lungs, and other parts of the body. This process is called embolization. One common complication of AFib is a ''blood clot'' that travels to the brain and causes the sudden onset of one-sided ''paralysis'' of the extremities and/or the facial muscles (an embolic stroke). A ''blood clot'"" that travels to the lungs can cause injury to the lung tissues (pulmonary infarction), and symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. When blood clots travel to the body's extremities, ""'cold hands'', ''feet'', or legs may occur suddenly because of the lack of blood.'  "
What is pulmonary vein isolation?,"'The four pulmonary veins are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. There is a narrow band of muscle cells that surrounds the openings of the pulmonary veins where they enter the left atrium. This band of muscle cells may begin to actively discharge electrically, and this discharge may initiate atrial fibrillation. During pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the band of muscle cells is destroyed by energy applied through a catheter. This effectively blocks the electrical discharges from crossing over from the band to the left atrium and, hence, prevents atrial fibrillation.''Before PVI, the doctor performs a history and physical examination, an EKG, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and a transesophageal ''echocardiogram'' to exclude blood clots in the atria, and, sometimes, a CAT scan of the chest. The doctor also may ask the person to stop certain medications, particularly blood thinners such as ''aspirin'', clopidogrel (''Plavix''), or warfarin, several days before the procedure. The doctor may check a blood prothrombin time and INR level to make sure that blood clotting is adequate for the procedure.''PVI is usually performed under deep conscious sedation (but occasionally general anesthesia) in a cardiac electrophysiology laboratory and takes 3 to 6 hours. Several catheters are inserted through large veins (in the neck, arm, or groin) and fed into the left atrium under X-ray (fluoroscopy) guidance. One of the catheters is equipped with an ultrasound transducer that allows the doctor to view the structures inside the heart during the procedure. The junction of the pulmonary veins with the left atrium is identified, and energy is then applied through another catheter to this area. This results in the destruction of the band of muscle cells and their replacement by a ''scar''. This process is repeated at the opening of each of the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium.''Course after pulmonary vein isolation:'"" After PVI, patients remain in the hospital telemetry unit so that the heart's rhythm can be monitored.""'Many patients will experience AFib and palpitations (irregular heartbeat) while in the hospital and during the first 2 or 3 months following PVI. Therefore, they are given medications such as amiodarone to prevent episodes of AFib and anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin to prevent strokes. The palpitations and episodes of AFib gradually decrease. By 3 months after the procedure, the majority of patients will have a normal rhythm, return to good health, and the doctor may stop warfarin and amiodarone.''Patients usually will have an EKG and a CAT scan of the chest 3 months after PVI. The CAT scan is done to make sure that there is no narrowing of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein stenosis) due to the scarring.''Effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation: ''PVI in the U.S. is a relatively new procedure. When performed by experienced doctors, PVI can be expected to prevent AFib in 70% to 80% of patients during the first year. Some patients may need additional PVI procedures to prevent further atrial fibrillation episodes. Because this procedure is new, it is difficult to know whether successfully treated patients will continue in a normal rhythm for a prolonged period.' "
"Who are candidates for PVI, and what are the risks?","'Generally, good candidates for PVI include:''When performed by doctors experienced in PVI, the procedure is safe. The risks of pulmonary vein isolation include cardiac tamponade (bleeding into the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart), narrowing of the openings of the pulmonary veins, injury to the phrenic nerve that controls the function of the ''diaphragm'', injury to peripheral blood vessels, and, in rare cases, death.''In the early years of PVI, doctors were trying to destroy the tissues inside the pulmonary veins. This led to narrowing (due to scarring) of the pulmonary veins, which in turn led to ''pulmonary hypertension'', a condition in which the ''blood pressure'' in the pulmonary veins and arteries increases. ''Pulmonary hypertension'' is a serious condition that can lead to congestive heart failure and even death. Doctors no longer try to destroy tissue inside the pulmonary veins. Instead, they try to destroy the tissues only at the junction of the pulmonary veins and the atria. The current technique is not only safer, but is more effective and simpler.'

What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' (''AFib'', AF) is a disturbance of the rhythm of the heartbeat (''arrhythmia''), a type of ''heart'' rhythm disorder.''To understand how ''atrial fibrillation'"" occurs, let's first understand the normal rhythm of the heart, and how the electrical activation of a heartbeat occurs. In a person with a healthy heart, the rhythm of the heartbeat is initiated by electrical activation of the natural ""'pacemaker'' of the heart -- the sinoatrial node (SA node). From there, the electrical activity spreads along natural pathways through the two chambers of the top of the heart (atria), then to the ventricles that pump the blood out into the circulation. The uniform contraction of the ''atrium'' that is generated by the electrical stimulation of the heart muscle of the ''atrium'', causes the ''atrium'' to contract, passing blood into the ventricle where it can then be pumped out into the circulation.''AFib'' occurs when the top chambers of the heart fire with electrical activity that is completely chaotic throughout the ''atrium'', without really forming a uniformly contracting ''atrium'' to pass blood down into the ventricles. The random electrical activity throughout the ''atrium'' connects randomly to the ventricle. This leads to what is referred to as an irregular heart rhythm of this common condition. AFib can cause the ventricle to contract irregularly at rates ranging from 100 to 200 beats per minute.''The irregularity of the heart contractions in AFib account for all of the symptoms caused by the disease. This condition is a type of ''heart disease''.' "
What are atrial fibrillation symptoms and signs?,"'Very often people with AFib have no signs or symptoms, and do not know they are in ''atrial fibrillation''. Those who notice when they are having ''atrial fibrillation'' can have signs and symptoms ranging from mild to debilitating.''Symptoms of this heart condition include:'  Rapid beating, pounding, or fluttering sensation in the chest (palpitations) Lightheadedness Dizziness Weakness Shortness of breath Uneasy feeling Fainting Fatigue Awakening from sleep Anxiousness Difficulty walking Chest discomfort or pain"
What does atrial fibrillation feel like?,"'A person with ''atrial fibrillation'' that causes no symptoms - causes no abnormal feelings or sensations. However, when a person experiences symptoms and signs of this type of ''heart disease'', one of the most common symptoms is a feeling of the heart beating rapidly. It also can feel like the heart is fluttering in the chest with ''palpitations'' as the heart beats irregularly. Because the chambers of the heart are beating irregularly, they do not adequately fill with blood before contracting. This causes insufficient oxygen distribution throughout the body, which can lead to:''Some people with early ''atrial fibrillation'' may have minimal symptoms. Often it is short-lived and the normal heart rhythm is restored. Later, this heart condition can occur more frequently, and for a longer duration of each episode. This is when signs and symptoms the person may be experiencing can be even more pronounced, and treatment may be necessary.'   Lightheadedness and dizziness, which may cause the person to fall from near fainting when they are upright. There can be a general sensation of weakness in the legs as well as an overall uneasy feeling Overall fatigue is commonly associated with shortness of breath. Ascending stairs or walking uphill this can make any movement difficult for a person with this health condition. There can be chest awareness and chest discomfort. Sometimes people with this disease wake up in the night with chest awareness (consciously noticing the organs within the chest that you normally are not aware of), palpitations, and anxiousness. The person can be sweating and a have a feeling of not being well."
Do all types of atrial fibrillation have the same symptoms?,"'Atrial ''fibrillation'' can be categorized as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.' Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurs in random episodes and does not persist, but spontaneously returns to normal heart rhythm after the episode (it comes and goes). Paroxysmal fibrillation symptoms include sudden onset of fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort when the atrial fibrillation begins. This can be associated with rapid onset fatigue and weakness. When it comes on at night it can awaken the person from sleep with sweating and anxiousness. Persistent atrial fibrillation is AFib that once initiated continues without spontaneously reverting to normal heart rhythm. Persistent AFib resolves only with chemical or electrical cardioversion. Persistent atrial fibrillation symptoms are identical to those of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation except that they do not spontaneously resolve. Permanent atrial fibrillation: Sometimes the heart rhythm of persistent atrial fibrillation cannot be converted to normal rhythm by cardioversion methods or the cardioversion is not sustained. In this situation, medications are used to slow the rapid heart rhythm so the heart can pump more efficiently and symptoms can be reduced. Permanent atrial fibrillation symptoms are typically less intense than those of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation as the rate of beating of the ventricles is slowed by drugs."
Who is at risk for atrial fibrillation?,"'There are several risk factors for this condition. For example, a patient who has, or has a history of:' Coronary heart disease Hypertension (high blood pressure) Blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Chronic lung diseases, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and asthma. Excessive alcohol intake Stimulant drug use, for example, cocaine or decongestants Recent heart or lung surgery Congenital heart disease"
Are heart attack or stroke symptoms different from atrial fibrillation symptoms?,"'A person that has chest discomfort or ''pain'' with AFib could be having a ''heart attack''. It is not possible to distinguish the cause of the chest discomfort or ''pain'' without a complete medical evaluation, including an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'').''Atrial fibrillation can lead to ''stroke'' from a ''blood clot'' in the heart dislodging and going to the brain. Four signs of ''stroke'' include:''AFib, ''stroke'', and ''heart attack'' are medical emergencies and the person who is ill should be seen by a doctor for treatment immediately.' Sudden onset slurring of speech Face drooping Drooling Weakness or numbness in an extremity"
What is the treatment for atrial fibrillation symptoms?,"'Treatment and management of ''symptoms of atrial fibrillation'' by either restoring the abnormal heart rhythm back to normal, or by controlling the abnormally fast rate.''To restore the heart rhythm to normal sometimes ''drugs'' are used intravenously that can convert the rhythm from AFib to normal sinus rhythm. There are many drugs and medical procedures that are very effective for eliminating and preventing AFib. Alternatively, electroshock pulse to the chest and heart can reset the heart rhythm to normal, and there are surgical interventions, for example, cardiac ablations and Maze procedures (a type of ablation) that can permanently correct this disease. The treating doctor will advise the best option for each individual as the ideal option varies from patient to patient.''A variety of drugs can be used to either decrease the electrical excitability of the heart in atrial fibrillation or limit the transmission of chaotic electrical impulses that reach the ventricles. Both are used to achieve a slower and more efficient heartbeat.''Medications referred to as ""blood thinners"" are frequently used for the treatment and management of AFib in order to prevent blood from clotting in the atria, which can lead to ''stroke''. These include ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'') and newer ''anticoagulants''. Often, ''anticoagulants'' are used for several weeks to minimize the risk of ''stroke''. In this case, drugs are used to slow the heart rate until the blood is adequately thinned. Simple ''aspirin'' is not an adequate blood thinner for AFib.''Atrial fibrillation is a health condition that a doctor should\xa0evaluate\xa0and diagnose. A patient should discuss his or her treatment plan with a\xa0doctor or other health care professional.''If you or someone you know experiences sign and ''symptoms of AFib'', ''stroke'', ''heart failure'', or heart attack seek medical care for treatment by a doctor, urgent care, or emergency room facility immediately.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with atrial fibrillation?,"'A person with this type of ''heart disease'' can live a normal, active life as long as he or she continues to receive ongoing medical treatment.' "
"What does ""fibrillation"" mean?","'Atrial fibrillation'' and ventricular ''fibrillation'' are ''heart'' conditions that include the term “''fibrillation''.” When defined as related to the heart, ""''fibrillation''"" refers to a very rapid irregular contractions of the heart’s muscle fibers.' "
What are the main differences between AFib and VFib?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' or ''AFib'', and ventricular ''fibrillation'' or VFib, are both a type of abnormal heart rhythm or heartbeat called an ''arrhythmia''.'""One of the main differences between these two heart conditions is that ventricular fibrillation is life threatening if treatment isn't begun immediately, while ""'atrial fibrillation'' generally is not immediately life threatening, but can cause problems with the ''heart function'' that are very dangerous if not treated effectively.'   AFib produces irregular electrical signals in the upper chambers of the heart muscle called the atria (and may include the AV node), causing the heart’s atria to beat irregularly and usually faster than normal. AFib usually is not an immediately life-threatening abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia). VFib produces irregular electrical signals in the lower chamber heart muscles (ventricles) that are so chaotic that the heart muscles can’t pump blood effectively. This type of heart condition is life threatening, and must be treated immediately or the person will likely die."
What are the main similarities between these two heart conditions?,"'Both types of ''heart disease'' are a type of abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia). AFib and VFib can be detected by ''ECG''’s and CPR defibrillators (machines that can identify arrhythmias and, if needed, can deliver shocks, or electrical impulses, to the heart to treat a life-threatening arrhythmia like VFib).' "
"What are AFib and VFib, and how do they affect the heart?","'To understand AFib and VFib, you need to know a little about your heart and how it normally works. The heart is composed of four muscular chambers, two upper and two lower. The two upper chambers are called the atria. The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.''AFib and VFib are both termed arrhythmias (''abnormal heart rhythms'').''AFib is a type of arrhythmia termed supraventricular tachycardia'', meaning that the problem occurs above the ventricles. For AFib, the ''abnormal heart rhythms'' are due to irregular electrical activity in the atria, mainly the right ''atrium''. It usually results in a fast and irregular heartbeat.''In contrast, ''VFib occurs when the electrical signal is chaotic'' within the ventricular muscular tissue and results in no effective heartbeat so there is no effective ''blood pressure'' or pulse generated, which results in ''sudden cardiac death'' of the individual if the abnormal heartbeat continues and is not treated immediately (immediately).' The impulse is first generated at the sinoatrial node (SA node), which causes the right atrium to contract sending blood to the right ventricle. The right ventricle then sends blood to the lungs to get rid of carbon dioxide (CO2) and to pick up oxygen (02). The lungs then return the fresh oxygenated blood to the left atrium, which contracts to fill the left ventricle. The left ventricle muscle tissue contracts, and generates the pulse and sends fresh oxygenated blood under pressure (blood pressure) to your body’s organs. Each heartbeat repeats the process, and normally produces an electrical signal that is consistent for each heartbeat. When the electrical signal is irregular in any way, the patient has an abnormal heart rhythm."
Is AFib or VFib more serious and dangerous?,"""By far, VFib is more serious. If ventricular fibrillation isn't treated immediately, the patient will have a “sudden death” or “""'cardiac arrest''” and die.' "
Differences between how AFib and VFib feel to a person (signs and symptoms),"'A person with AFib may have no symptoms, but in general, they may notice an irregular and rapid heartbeat. Other symptoms that may occur are:''In contrast, ventricular fibrillation (VFib) has very short-lived signs and symptoms.''About an hour so before the person suddenly collapses due to ventricular fibrillation, some people may have these signs and symptoms.'  Fatigue (especially when exercising) A fluttering or thumping in the chest Weakness Dizziness Shortness of breath Anxiety Feel like you are going to faint Confusion Chest discomfort or pain (if you have this use extreme caution, call 911 in case you are having a heart attack) Sudden collapse Fainting with no response to stimulation (loss of consciousness) No or weak, erratic pulse Death if not treated immediately Dizziness Nausea Shortness of breath Chest pain and/or tachycardia"
What causes these two heart diseases?,"'Many underlying medical problems may contribute to the development of AFib and/or VFib. Some causes that are common to both heart conditions include:' Heart or cardiovascular disease Cardiomyopathy Drugs Alcohol consumption High cholesterol levels Increasing age A diet containing high levels of animal fat (meat) Severe infections High blood pressure Metabolic imbalances Stimulants (medications, caffeine, nicotine) Stress"
How do the EKG patterns differ for AFib and VFib?,"'The ''EKG'' patterns in most cases are diagnostic for AFib and/or VFib because of the characteristic wave forms each produce.''Normal ''ECG'' wave strip pattern''Atrial fibrillation'' ECG''AFib shows ''irregular P wave patterns (the small “spike” just before the QRS or big spike pattern), which indicates irregular atrial contractions interrupted by QRS patterns (heartbeats or effective ventricular cardiac blood pumping).''ECG (''electrocardiogram'' or ''EKG'') of VFib shows only fast irregular electrical tracings with no tracings showing a QRS (the large “spike” pattern on a normal ECG) indicative of a heartbeat (ventricular contraction).' "
What is the treatment for AFib and VFib?,"'Atrial fibrillation''\xa0may automatically revert to normal sinus rhythm and require no treatment, in a few people. Many people with AFib can be treated with heart rate controlling or rhythm-controlling medications (see ''prevention''). Moreover, some people with AFib may respond well to electrical ''cardioversion''. This is performed by giving the heart an electrical ''shock'' that results in resetting the heart’s normal electric pattern. Ablation techniques destroy malfunctioning heart tissue responsible for the abnormal atrial electrical activity.''Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency'' heart condition that requires immediate therapy. VFib can be treated with an electrical ''shock'' to the heart with a ''defibrillator''. While a ''defibrillator'' is being located, CPR (''cardiopulmonary resuscitation'') with chest compressions is used to keep the person alive until a defibrillator shock terminates VFib. This allows the heart to produce an effective electrical current that causes the ventricular function to become organized enough to pump blood (for example, return to normal cardiac rhythm). Ventricular fibrillation may be the end signs of a dying heart and may be difficult to treat in some instances. ''Defibrillation'' in these cases may not work and the patient may die due to ''cardiac arrest''.' "
Is it possible to prevent these heart conditions?," Medications such as antiarrhythmic drugs (beta blockers) Implantable devices (cardioverter – defibrillator or ICD) that detect VFib and automatically shock the heart; and treatment for underlying problems like coronary artery disease (for example, angioplasty, stent placement and/or coronary artery bypass surgery). These treatments may reduce the chance of sudden death from VFib. Rhythm and rate controlling drugs Ablation techniques to destroy cardiac tissue that is generating abnormal electrical patterns Pacemaker to regulate the heartbeat in case the electrical activity the heart starts becoming too fast or too slow A surgical technique termed the Maze procedure may be performed in which a surgeon creates small cuts in the heart to form scars that interfere with electrical impulses that can cause AFib."
What’s the life expectancy for someone with AFib or VFib?,"'Underlying causes usually determine the life expectancy in people with AFib. People who are treated for the causes or triggers of AFib (for example, alcohol intake, metabolic problems, ''coronary artery disease'', ''sepsis'' and many others), usually will have a normal life expectancy. Those who respond poorly to treatments will have a poorer prognosis.''VFib needs immediate treatment (CPR and ''defibrillation'') or the person will likely die within a few minutes. However, if it VFib is treated immediately, it may reduce the chances of having another\xa0VFib. In people who survive VFib, the survival rate and life expectancy is similar to AFib if the causes and triggers of VFib are treated and managed.\xa0' "
Different terms and abbreviations used for atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation,"'Caution should be taken when using the short form “AF.” AF is also a short form term for another similar heart arrhythmia – ''atrial flutter'' – that is closely related to AFib.' Abbreviations for Atrial Fibrillation: AFib, Afib, AF, afib Abbreviations for ventricular fibrillation: VFib, Vfib, VF, vfib"
What is the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood test?,"'The most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AFP is a protein normally made by the immature ''liver'' cells in the fetus. Healthy, nonpregnant adults have very low levels of AFP in the bloodstream (undetectable to about 10 ng/ml). At birth, infants have relatively high levels of AFP in the blood, which fall to normal low adult levels by the first year of life.''Pregnant'' women carrying ''babies'' with ''neural tube defects'' may have high levels of AFP in both the bloodstream, urine, and in the ''amniotic fluid''. A neural tube defect is an abnormal fetal brain or spinal cord that is caused by ''folic acid'' deficiency during ''pregnancy''. Examples of these ''birth defects'' include ''spina bifida'' and ''anencephaly''. Women carrying twins or other multiples may also have elevated levels of AFP due to the presence of multiple fetuses producing AFP. Lower than normal AFP levels in pregnant women are sometimes seen in pregnant women carrying babies with genetic conditions such as ''Down syndrome''.''It is important to note that abnormal levels of AFP in pregnancy do not necessarily mean there is a problem with the baby. If AFP levels are not normal, it means that more tests should be done to determine the cause. The American Pregnancy Association says that all pregnant women should be offered an AFP test sometime between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. AFP is typically part of the triple screen or quad screen test (along with human chorionic gonadotropin or HCG, estriol, and inhibin A) used in the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy to determine whether additional testing is necessary.''Alpha-fetoprotein is also produced by certain ''cancers'', such as liver or ''testicular cancer'', and is sometimes measured as a ''tumor'' marker (see below).''The AFP tumor marker test can be performed on a blood sample, urine sample, or sample of amniotic fluid.. Other names for the test include total AFP, MSAFP (maternal serum AFP), and alpha-fetoprotein-L3 percent (%)'  "
"In which situations are high blood (serum) levels of AFP used as a tumor 
marker?","'In nonpregnant adults, high blood levels (over 500 nanograms/milliliter [or ng/ml]) of AFP are seen in only a few situations, such as' hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary cancer of the liver; germ cell tumors (a type of cancer of the testes and ovaries, such as embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumors); and ataxia telangiectasia, a severely disabling and rare genetic neurodegenerative disease."
What tests measure AFP?,"'Several assays (tests) for measuring AFP in the blood (serum) are available to laboratories. Generally, normal levels of AFP are below 10 ng/ml. People with various types of acute and chronic liver diseases without documentable ''liver cancer'' can have mild or even moderate elevations of AFP, though usually less than 500 ng/ml.'""The blood sample for an AFP test can be obtained in any doctor's office or clinic where blood samples are drawn. The sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis."" "
What is the sensitivity of AFP for diagnosing liver cancer?,"'Primary liver ''cancer'', or hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma, is more common in some forms of chronic ''liver disease''. As a screening test in patients with chronic ''hepatitis B'' and C, or ''hemochromatosis'', AFP has a sensitivity for liver ''cancer'' of about 70%. In other words, an elevated AFP blood test is seen in about 70% people with primary liver cancer. That leaves about 30% of patients in these high-risk groups who can have liver cancer but have normal AFP levels. Consequently, the test is not diagnostic but is an indicator of a potential situation. Therefore, a normal AFP does not exclude liver cancer. For example, AFP levels are normal in a patient with fibrolamellar carcinoma, a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma.''As noted above, an abnormal AFP does not mean that an individual has liver cancer. It is important to note, however, that people with ''cirrhosis'' (scarring) of the liver and an abnormal AFP, despite having no evidence of liver cancer, still are at very high risk of developing liver cancer. Thus, anyone with ''cirrhosis'' and an elevated AFP, particularly with steadily rising blood levels, will either most likely develop liver cancer or actually already have an undiscovered liver cancer.''An AFP greater than 500 ng/ml is very suggestive of liver cancer. In fact, the blood level of AFP loosely relates to (correlates with) the size of the liver cancer.''Finally, in patients with liver cancer and abnormal AFP levels, the AFP may be used as a marker of response to treatment. For example, an elevated AFP is expected to fall to normal in a patient whose liver cancer is successfully removed surgically (resected). If AFP then increases again, liver cancer recurrence is likely.''In certain cancers of the testis as described above, the AFP is measured at diagnosis and followed as a tumor marker in a fashion similar to that described above in people with liver cancer.''AFP is not recommended as a screening tool for detection of cancer in normal, healthy people.' "
What does a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy mean?,"'An ovarian cystectomy is a surgery performed to remove sac-like fluid pockets (''cyst'') from your ovary (a woman’s reproductive organ). These ''cysts'' cause problems in menses and ''infertility''. There are various techniques for the procedure such as:''Nowadays, a laparoscopic method is mostly preferred because it is less painful and has a quick recovery, small ''scar'', and a short hospital stay.' Laparotomy: In a laparotomy, your surgeon makes a long cut on your tummy to reach the ovary and remove the cysts. Laparoscopic surgery: It is a keyhole surgery where small cuts are made on your tummy. Gas is blown into the belly to allow the surgeon to access your ovaries. Then a small, tube-shaped microscope with a light at the end is inserted into your tummy through these two to three holes so your surgeon can see your internal organs, remove the cysts, and close the small cuts with dissolvable stitches."
What can help me recover faster?,"'Your body takes time to heal the surgery incision and get fit and well again after a ''laparoscopy''. Recovering after the surgery is a very personal experience. If you follow the advice given by your doctor, you may achieve it faster. Most women feel better within the first week after surgery. You can follow some tips to help you recover faster.' Establish a daily routine and keep it up such as early sleeping and rising. Wash and get dressed every day. Eating a nutritious, healthy, high-fiber, and balanced diet including fresh fruits and vegetables will fasten your recovery processes. Drink up to 2 L of fluids, mainly water. Quit smoking to lessen the chances of wound infection and chest problems. Gradual regular exercise will build up the strength of muscles soon. It will also help you lose some excess weight, which may reduce your chances of getting more cysts in the ovary in the future. A positive outlook and attitude toward your disease and healing will fasten the healing process. Do not lift, push, or pull any heavy object for a few weeks. Avoid immediate strenuous long journeys."
What can slow down my recovery?,"'Your recovery process may slow down and can take longer to feel good if you' Had serious health issues such as diabetes that may increase your risk of infections. Smoke. It may increase your risk of a chest or wound infection during the recovery process.  Drink excessive alcohol that can delay the healing process. Had excessive weight at the time of your surgery. If you are overweight, it may take longer to recover from the effects of anesthesia, and there are higher chances of complications such as infection and thrombosis. Had any complications during your surgery.  Use certain prescription medications such as anti-clotting medicine."
What are the possible complications?,'Complications include:' Infection Bleeding Cyst returns Need for removal of one or both ovaries Infertility Blood clots in the legs Blood clot traveling to your lungs  Damage to the bowel and bladder Bands of scar (adhesion) stick tissues or organs together
When to see a doctor?,"'See your doctor if you have' Burning and stinging pain while passing urine or passing urine frequently. No urine in the last 24 hours. Red and painful skin around your laparoscopy scars. Increase in tummy pain with fever, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Painful, red, swollen, and hot leg or difficulty bearing weight on your legs. No improvement in symptoms."
What does breast cancer mean?,"'Breast cancer means a disease in which the cells of your breast abnormally grow out of control. It commonly occurs in women than in men.''There are different types of breast cancer depending on the type of cells that turned cancerous (grow wildly). It may begin in different parts of your breast. However, mostly, it begins in the ducts or lobules (glands that produce milk) of your breast. Further, it may spread outside your breast through the blood vessels and lymph vessels (carries the waste products and toxins). When these breast cancer cells spread to other parts of your body, it is called ''metastasis''.''According to the Centre of Disease Control and ''Prevention'', women aged 50 years or more are most likely to suffer from breast cancer. However, around 11% of all new breast cancer cases in the United States were of women aged younger than 45 years.' "
What does lymphedema mean?,"'Lymph nodes'' are small structures that filter out harmful substances such as toxins from our body. Clear lymph fluid in the lymph nodes also contains white blood cells that fight against the infection.''Blockage into these lymph carrying vessels may cause the accumulation of lymph, which may result in swelling of the lymph nodes called as lymphedema (particularly in your arm/armpit or leg/groin area). Causes of blockage may be an infection, ''scar tissue'' formation, a \xa0''blood clot''\xa0in a vein,\xa0''radiation'', or other\xa0cancer\xa0treatments.''Your risk of lymphedema is high if you have' Excessive weight. Infections. Trauma. Certain lymphatic diseases. Removal of subsequent lymph nodes."
How can you reduce the risk of lymphedema after breast cancer treatment?,"'If you have undergone breast cancer treatment, your doctor/oncologist/oncosurgeon may inform you about optimal self-care measures to reduce your risk of lymphedema that include''These optimal self-care methods allow lymph drainage and reduce further inflammation and infection of the lymphatic system and repeated ''cellulitis''. Practicing these self-care methods may reduce your financial burden due to repeated sufferings and its effect on daily quality of life including work-absenteeism and unemployment.''Even after this if you have lymphedema, your oncologist may suggest you' Optimal healthy weight control byHealthy lifestyle practices such as a healthy diet.Exercises.Long-term physical therapy to drain the fluid from your arm or leg. Healthy lifestyle practices such as a healthy diet. Exercises. Long-term physical therapy to drain the fluid from your arm or leg. Using compression garments, bandages, and special lotions after breast cancer treatment. Avoiding lifting of heavyweight after surgery until your oncologist/oncosurgeon suggests that you can.

What is macular degeneration?,"'Macular degeneration is a common, painless eye condition in which the central portion of the retina deteriorates and does not function adequately.' "
What is the retina?,"'The retina is the light sensitive tissue located in the back of the eye. It is like the film in a camera, recording the images we see and sending them via the ''optic nerve'' from the eye to the brain. The retina almost instantly converts light images into electrical impulses through a chemical reaction. The retina then sends these impulses or signal, to the brain, where we interpret what we see, process the visual information, and relate what we see to the rest of our environment.' "
What is the macula?,"'The macula is a small portion of the retina located in the central portion of the retina. The macula is responsible for central vision (straight-ahead vision) and provides the ability to see fine detail in your direct line of sight. We use the macula of each eye to have the clear vision that allows us to read, drive a car, and recognize faces or colors. The non-macular areas of the retina provide us with both our side vision and best night vision.' "
What is age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"'While there are many causes of macular degeneration, including genetic abnormalities such as Stargardt disease, ''age-related macular degeneration'' (AMD or ARMD) is by far the most common type. AMD is a disease associated with ''aging'' that gradually destroys the sharp central vision needed for seeing objects clearly and for common daily tasks such as reading and driving. In some cases, AMD advances so slowly that people notice little change in their vision. In others, the disease progresses faster and may lead to a ''loss of vision'' in one or both eyes. AMD is the leading cause of ''vision loss'' in Americans 60 years of age and older. AMD usually affects both eyes, although the clinical appearance and degree of visual loss may vary a great deal between the two eyes.''AMD occurs in two forms. ""Wet"" age-related macular degeneration is less common but more aggressive in its progression to severe central vision loss. ""Dry"" age-related macular degeneration is the more common type and is more slowly progressive in causing visual loss.''Doctors classify AMD as to its severity, using terms such as mild, moderate, or severe. These terms are subjective and not based on specific characteristics.'  "
What is wet age-related macular degeneration?,"""Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow from the choroid (the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer firm coat of the eye called the sclera) under and into the macular portion of the retina. These new blood vessels (known as choroidal neovascularization or CNV) tend to be very fragile and often leak blood and fluid. The blood and fluid raise the macula from its normal place at the back of the eye, interfere with the retina's function, and cause the central vision to blur. Under these circumstances, vision loss may be rapid and severe. Some patients, however, do not notice visual changes despite the onset of CNV. Therefore, periodic eye examinations are very important for patients at risk for CNV.""'Once CNV has developed in one eye, whether there is a visual loss or not, the other eye is at relatively high risk for the same change.''The CNV of all wet AMD is potentially a cause of significant visual loss, whether or not there is major visual decrease at the time of diagnosis. Wet AMD does not have specific stages like dry AMD. The wet form generally leads to significantly more vision loss than the dry form.''All people who have the dry form of AMD are at risk for development of the wet form. Most people who have the wet form had the dry form first. The dry form can advance and cause vision loss without turning into the wet form. The dry form also suddenly can turn into the wet form. Currently, there is no certain way to predict if or when the dry form will turn into the wet form.' "
What are retinal drusen?,"'Retinal drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often appear in people over 60 years of age. Your ''eye care'' professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.'""Drusen alone do not usually cause vision loss. In fact, scientists are unclear about the connection between drusen and AMD. It is not clear whether an increase in the size or number of drusen raises a person's risk of developing either advanced dry AMD or wet AMD."" "
What is dry age-related macular degeneration?,"'In dry AMD, the light sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. With less of the macula functioning, central vision diminishes. Dry AMD often occurs in just one eye at first. Later, it may affect the other eye. The cause of dry AMD is unknown.''Dry AMD has three stages (early, intermediate, or advanced), all of which may occur in one or both eyes. The amount and characteristics of the drusen that are present define these stages. People with early AMD have either several small drusen or a few medium-sized drusen. At this stage, there are no symptoms and no vision loss.''People with intermediate AMD have either many medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen. Some people see a blurred spot in the center of their vision and may need more light for reading and other tasks.''In addition to drusen, people with advanced dry AMD have a breakdown of light-sensitive cells and supporting tissue in the central retinal area (geographic atrophy). Geographic atrophy can cause a blurred spot in the center of your vision. Over time, the blurred spot may get bigger and darker, taking more of your central vision. You may have difficulty reading or recognizing faces until they are very close to you.''The dry form is much more common than the wet form. In dry AMD, there is no CNV (abnormal new blood vessel formation under the retina) and no fluid or blood leakage into the retina (retinal swelling or bleeding).''Dry AMD can advance and cause vision loss without turning into wet AMD. Dry AMD can also rapidly transform into the wet form by the growth of new blood vessels.' "
What causes macular degeneration?,"'We do not know the precise cause for the development of AMD or ARMD. However, we do know that there are certain risk factors for the development of age-related macular degeneration.' "
What are risk factors for age-related macular degeneration?,"'The greatest risk factor is age. Although AMD may occur during middle age, studies show that people over age 60 are clearly at greater risk than other age groups. Middle-aged people have about a 2% risk of getting AMD while people over age 75 have a nearly 30% risk.''Other risk factors include ''smoking'', obesity, white race, female gender, a family history of macular degeneration, a ''diet'' low in fruit and vegetables, ''high blood pressure'', and elevated blood ''cholesterol''.'  "
What are macular degeneration symptoms?,"'Neither dry nor wet AMD cause any ''eye pain'' or ''floaters''.''The most common early symptom in dry AMD is blurred vision. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them, such as faces or words in a book. Often this blurred vision will go away in brighter light. If the loss of these light-sensing cells becomes great, people may see a small black or gray blind spot in the middle of their field of vision.''Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and do not include total ''blindness''. However, the symptoms may worsen the quality of life by making reading, driving, and facial recognition difficult. Other symptoms may include decreased night vision, a decrease in the intensity or brightness of colors and increase in the haziness of overall vision. People often complain of eyestrain.''Dry macular degeneration may affect one eye or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, a person may not notice symptoms because the unaffected eye has no visual symptoms.''A person also may notice all of the above symptoms in the wet form of AMD. In addition, the most common symptom in wet macular degeneration is straight lines appearing crooked or wavy. This results when fluid from the leaking blood vessels gathers within and lifts the macula, distorting vision. Larger areas of gray or black in the central area of vision may also occur. The central vision may decrease over a short period.''Glasses do not improve the decrease in vision from macular degeneration. However, patients with macular degeneration often also have pre-existing ''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', ''astigmatism'', or/and ''presbyopia'', all of which may require glasses.' "
What are signs of macular degeneration?,"'In both dry and wet forms of macular degeneration, the ophthalmologist may find decreased visual clarity (acuity) with preservation of peripheral vision and changes in the central retina visible with the ophthalmoscope. An ophthalmologist may see areas of atrophic retina in the macula in both dry and wet forms of the disease. Your eye doctor may note fluid or exudative material under or within the retina in wet forms of macular degeneration.''Many other retinal diseases, such as ''diabetic retinopathy'' or ''retinitis pigmentosa'', can cause visual loss. These are unrelated to AMD.'  "
What type of specialist treats macular degeneration?,"'An ophthalmologist or optometrist can make a diagnosis of macular degeneration. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has specialized in the diagnosis and medical/surgical treatment of eye disease. In order to diagnose macular degeneration, an ophthalmologist dilates the pupils with eyedrops so that the retina can be clearly seen. Once the diagnosis of macular degeneration is made, any ophthalmologist can make distinguishing between the dry or wet variety. If you are found to have wet macular degeneration by a non-ophthalmologist, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist specializing in vitreo-retinal diseases. Vitreo-retinal subspecialists care for the majority of patients in the United States receiving treatment with intravitreal injections for wet AMD.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose macular degeneration?,"'Your ophthalmologist may suspect the diagnosis of AMD if you are over age 60 and have had recent changes in your central vision. To look for signs of the disease, he or she will use eyedrops to dilate, or enlarge, your pupils. Dilating the pupils allows your ophthalmologist to view the back of the eye better.''An ophthalmologist often diagnoses early AMD during a comprehensive eye exam in patients without significant symptoms. This eye exam includes having drops placed in your eyes to enlarge, or dilate, the pupils. Your ophthalmologist will carefully examine the central portion of the retina to determine the presence or absence of AMD using various illuminating and magnifying devices.''During the eye exam, your eye doctor may ask you to look at a checkerboard pattern called an Amsler grid. When looking at an Amsler grid with one eye, patients with AMD may notice that the straight lines of the checkerboard appear wavy or are missing.''Other diagnostic tests that your ophthalmologist may perform include retinal photography, fluorescein ''angiography'' and optical coherence tomography. All of these can help to differentiate between dry and wet forms of AMD and document the abnormalities so that progression and response to treatment can be better measured.' "
What is the treatment for wet macular degeneration?,"'Laser surgery, ''photodynamic therapy'', and injections into the eye treat wet AMD. None of these treatments is a permanent cure for wet AMD. The disease and loss of vision may progress despite treatment.''Laser surgery in the form of photocoagulation destroys the fragile, leaky blood vessels. A high-energy beam of light is aimed directly onto the new blood vessels to eradicate them, preventing further loss of vision. However, laser treatment may also destroy some surrounding healthy tissue and some vision. Because of this, a doctor can only treat eyes with new vessels away from the exact center of the vision. This represents only a small proportion of patients with AMD. Laser surgery is only effective in halting or slowing visual loss if the leaky blood vessels have developed away from the fovea, the central part of the macula. Even in treated cases, the risk of new blood vessels recurring after treatment is significant and further or other treatment may be necessary.''Photodynamic therapy uses a drug called verteporfin (''Visudyne'') injected into a vein of the arm. The ophthalmologist then directs a light of a specific wavelength into the eye to activate the drug adhering to the blood vessels in the eye. The activated drug destroys the new blood vessels and leads to a slower rate of vision decline. Photodynamic therapy may slow the rate of vision loss. It does not stop vision loss or restore vision in eyes already damaged by advanced AMD. Treatment results often are temporary. Retreatment may be necessary.''Within the last 14 years, injections into the eye with ''drugs'' specifically developed to stop the growth of new blood vessels have revolutionized the treatment of wet macular degeneration and have become the mainstay of treatment of wet macular degeneration. We have learned that a specific chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is necessary for the new blood vessels to grow under the retina. An ophthalmologist can inject drugs that counter VEGF (anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy) into the eye to arrest development of new blood vessels and sometimes cause them to regress. These drugs include Eylea (aflibercept) and Lucentis (ranibizumab), both approved by the FDA for this indication, and ''Avastin'"" (bevacizumab), which is unapproved by the FDA for injection into the eye and requires compounding by a specialized pharmacy. Some physicians preferentially use Avastin because of its much lower cost. An ophthalmologist injects these drugs into the vitreous of the eye and may need to administer these injections as frequently as monthly. Careful observation of the eye on a monthly basis to determine the drug effect is necessary in the case of Lucentis and every other month in the case of Eylea. With this treatment, it's often possible to halt or slow vision loss, and some patients will even experience some improvement of vision. Newer drugs currently under review may need to be given less frequently. Photodynamic therapy and laser ablation have been largely, if not completely, abandoned in favor of VEGF inhibitors. New and perhaps more effective anti-VEGF medicines, including drugs that counter platelet derived growth factors and angiopoietins are currently in ""'clinical trials'"" and approaching the market. If diagnosed and treated early, the patient's chances of a better outcome are improved.""'In patients with far advanced macular degeneration on both eyes, surgery to implant a telescopic ''lens'"" in one eye is an option. The telescope implant, which surgically replaces the eye's natural lens, magnifies images while reducing the field of vision (peripheral vision). The telescopic lens implant may improve both distance and close-up central vision.""  "
What is the treatment for dry macular degeneration?,"'There is currently no treatment available to reverse dry macular degeneration. However, dry macular degeneration is usually slowly progressive and most patients with this condition are able to live relatively normal, productive lives. Often one eye is affected more than the other.'""Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent further vision loss. However, treatment can delay and possibly prevent intermediate AMD from progressing to the advanced stage of severe vision loss. The National Eye Institute's Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS and AREDS2) found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduces the risk of advanced AMD and its associated vision loss. Slowing AMD's progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage is helpful in reducing the progression of visual loss in many people.""'In this study, researchers used an antioxidant formulation that included ''vitamin C'', ''vitamin E'', beta-carotene (or ''vitamin A''), and zinc. For people with early-stage dry macular degeneration, there is no evidence that these ''vitamins'' provide a benefit. It is recommended that people with intermediate-stage dry AMD in one or both eyes or advanced stage AMD (dry or wet) in one eye, but not the other eye, take the AREDS formulation. Patients with increased risk of ''lung cancer'' should not take beta-carotene. Studies involving other ''supplements'' such as lutein, zeaxanthin, other carotenoids, black currant, and bilberry are currently under way.''Lifestyle changes can slow the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration. These include changing the diet to include more fruits and vegetable, choosing healthy unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, over unhealthy saturated fats, such as butter, eating whole grains rather than refined grains and adding fish high in ''omega-3 fatty acids''.' "
What are complications of macular degeneration?,"'Progression to wet macular degeneration is the main complication of dry age-related macular degeneration. At any time, dry macular degeneration can progress to the more severe form of the disease called wet macular degeneration, which may cause rapid vision loss. There is no accurate way to predict who will eventually develop wet macular degeneration.''Other eye diseases such as ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', ''retinal detachment'', or ''dry eyes'' are not complications of macular degeneration. However, patients with macular degeneration can develop these or other eye diseases and people with these conditions can also develop AMD concurrently.' "
What is the prognosis for macular degeneration?,"'Macular degeneration in its advanced form can cause loss of all central vision in both eyes. In the absence of other eye diseases, peripheral vision is maintained. Therefore, patients with advanced macular degeneration are, in most cases, able to see enough to get around within familiar surroundings.''The use of magnifying devices can often improve vision in macular degeneration to allow for reading or watching of television.' "
Is it possible to prevent macular degeneration?,"'Your lifestyle can play a role in reducing your risk of developing AMD. Eating a healthy diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish, not ''smoking'', maintaining ''blood pressure'' and weight at normal levels, and engaging in regular moderate ''exercise'' can be helpful in ''prevention'' of macular degeneration.'

What is the latest research on macular degeneration?,"'There is a large amount of research currently being performed to increase our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of macular degeneration. These include evaluation of families with a history of AMD to understand genetic and hereditary factors that may cause the disease. There are multiple drugs and devices presently in various phases of clinical trials to both prevent and treat macular degeneration. These include new drugs to prevent new blood vessel formation, certain anti-inflammatory treatments for the wet form of AMD, and drug-delivery systems to reduce the need for frequent injections for the wet form of macular degeneration. Researchers are investigating the possibility of transplantation of healthy cells into a diseased retina.''This research should provide better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with AMD.' "
What is prosopagnosia?,"'Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces. Prosopagnosia is also known as face blindness or facial agnosia. The term prosopagnosia comes from the Greek words for “face” and “lack of knowledge.” Depending upon the degree of impairment, some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing a familiar face; others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, while still others may not even be able to distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some people with the disorder are unable to recognize their own face. Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, ''memory loss'', impaired vision, or ''learning disabilities''. Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from ''stroke'', traumatic ''brain injury'', or certain neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases it is a congenital disorder, present at birth in the absence of any ''brain damage''. Congenital prosopagnosia appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often present in children with ''autism'' and ''Asperger’s syndrome'', and may be the cause of their impaired social development.\xa0'  "
Is there any treatment?,'The focus of any treatment should be to help the individual with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies. Adults who have the condition as a result of ''stroke'' or brain trauma can be retrained to use other clues to identify individuals.'  
What is the prognosis?,"'Prosopagnosia can be socially crippling. Individuals with the disorder often have difficulty recognizing family members and close friends. They often use other ways to identify people, such as relying on voice, clothing, or unique physical attributes, but these are not as effective as recognizing a face. Children with congenital prosopagnosia are born with the disability and have never had a time when they could recognize faces. Greater awareness of ''autism'', and the ''autism'' spectrum disorders, which involve communication impairments such as prosopagnosia, is likely to make the disorder less overlooked in the future.' "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to prosopagnosia in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia.' "
What is the definition of agoraphobia?,"'A phobia is usually defined as the severe, unrelenting fear of a situation, activity, or thing that makes one to want to avoid it. The definition of agoraphobia is the severe anxiety about being outside or otherwise being in a situation from which one either cannot escape or from which escaping would be difficult or embarrassing.''Phobias'' are often underreported and underdiagnosed, likely because many phobia sufferers find ways to avoid the situations to which they are phobic. The fact that agoraphobia often co-occurs with panic disorder makes it even more difficult to determine how often it occurs. Other statistics about agoraphobia include that researchers estimate it occurs from less than 1% to nearly 7% of the population. The age of onset for this condition is most often during the mid to late 20s.'  "
What causes agoraphobia?,"'There are a number of theories about what can cause agoraphobia. One hypothesis is that agoraphobia develops in response to repeated exposure to anxiety-provoking events. Mental-health theory that focuses on how people react to internal emotional conflicts (psychoanalytic theory) describes agoraphobia as being the result of a feeling of emptiness that comes from an unresolved Oedipal conflict, which is a tension between the feelings the person has toward the opposite-sex parent and a sense of competition with the same-sex parent. Although agoraphobia, like other mental disorders, is related to a number of psychological and environmental risk factors, it also tends to run in families, and for some individuals, may have a clear contributing genetic component. Girls and women are more likely to develop agoraphobia compared to boys and men. For ethnic minorities in the United States, a number of factors influence the likelihood of developing agoraphobia or any other anxiety disorder, like immigration from another country, language proficiency, feeling discriminated against, as well as the specific ethnicity of the individual.' "
What are agoraphobia symptoms?,"'Symptoms of agoraphobia include anxiety that one will have a ''panic attack'' when in a situation from which escape is not possible or is difficult or humiliating. Examples of such situations include using public transportation, being in open or confined places or being in crowds. The apprehension or panic attacks that can be associated with agoraphobia, like all panic attacks, may involve symptoms and signs like intense fear, disorientation, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, ''dizziness'', or ''diarrhea''. Agoraphobic individuals often begin to avoid the situations that provoke these reactions. Interestingly, the situations that people with agoraphobia avoid and the environments that cause people with ''balance disorders'' to feel disoriented are quite similar. This leads some cases of agoraphobia to be considered as vestibular function (related to ''balance disorders'') agoraphobia.'  "
What are the risk factors for agoraphobia?,"'Agoraphobia tends to begin by adolescence or early adulthood. Girls and women, Native Americans, middle-aged individuals, low-income populations, and individuals who are either widowed, separated, or divorced are at increased risk of developing agoraphobia. Individuals who are Asian, Hispanic, or of African/African-American descent tend to have a lower risk of developing this disorder. However, people who have felt discriminated against are thought to be at higher risk of suffering from a number of anxiety disorders, including agoraphobia.''Having a history of panic attacks is a risk factor for developing agoraphobia. Agoraphobic individuals are at increased risk for developing panic attacks, as well. Other anxiety disorders that tend to co-occur with agoraphobia include ''social anxiety disorder'' (''social phobia'') and ''generalized anxiety disorder''. Even the use of ''alcohol'' can result in severe, albeit temporary anxiety.' "
When should one seek medical care for agoraphobia?,"'Call a doctor when the signs and symptoms of anxiety are not easily, quickly, and clearly relieved.'""When the signs and symptoms suggest that anxiety may have been present for a prolonged period (more than a few days) and appear to be stable (not getting significantly worse), it's advisable to make an appointment with a doctor for evaluation. But when the signs and symptoms are severe and come on suddenly, they may indicate serious medical illness that needs immediate evaluation and treatment in a hospital's emergency department."" If the symptoms are so severe that medication may be needed If the symptoms are interfering with someone's personal, social, or professional life If one has chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, palpitations, dizziness, fainting spells, or unexplained weakness If one is experiencing depression or feeling suicidal or homicidal"
What tests do physicians use to diagnose agoraphobia?,"'Interestingly, physicians often diagnose and treat agoraphobia, like other phobias, when patients seek treatment for other medical or emotional problems rather than as the primary reason that care is sought. As with other mental disorders, there is no single, specific test for agoraphobia. The primary-care doctor or psychiatrist will take a careful history, perform or refer to another doctor for a physical examination, and order laboratory tests as needed. If someone has another medical condition that he or she knows about or there has been exposure to a medication, drug of abuse or other substance, there may be an overlap of signs and symptoms between the old and the new conditions. Just determining that anxiety does not have a physical cause does not immediately identify the ultimate cause. Often, determining the cause requires the involvement of a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, and/or other mental-health professional.''In order to establish the diagnosis of agoraphobia, the professional will likely ask questions to ensure that the anxiety of the sufferer is truly the result of a fear of being in situations that make it impossible, difficult, or embarrassing to escape rather than in the context of another emotional problem (for example, fear of being near people that remind one of an abuser in the case of ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' or the fear of ''hearing'' voices that have no basis in reality as occurs in ''schizophrenia''). The evaluator will also seek to determine if the symptoms of agoraphobia have occurred most times that the sufferer has been exposed to the previously described anxiety-provoking situations over at least a six-month period.' "
What is the treatment for agoraphobia?,"'There are many treatments available for overcoming agoraphobia, including specific kinds of ''psychotherapy'' as well as several effective medications. A specific form of psychotherapy that focuses on decreasing negative, anxiety-provoking, or other self-defeating thoughts and behaviors (called cognitive behavioral therapy) has been found to be highly effective in treating agoraphobia. In fact, when agoraphobia occurs along with panic disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy, with or without treatment with medication, is considered to be the most effective way to both relieve symptoms and prevent their return. In fact, sometimes patients respond equally as well when treated with group cognitive behavioral therapy or a brief course of that kind of therapy, as they do when treated with traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. Psychotherapy for agoraphobia is also effective for many people when they receive it over the Internet, which is optimistic news for people who live in areas that are hundreds of miles from the nearest mental-health professional.''Another form of therapy that has been found effective in managing agoraphobia includes self-exposure. In that intervention, people either imagine or put themselves into situations that cause increasing levels of agoraphobic anxiety, using relaxation techniques in each situation (systematic desensitization) in order to master their anxiety. When avoiding the cause of the anxiety is gradually, thoughtfully prevented as part of this mode of therapy, it is often referred to as exposure and response ''prevention''. As people gain access to the Internet, there is increasing evidence that exposure therapy can also be done effectively through that medium.''Regarding medication therapy, agoraphobia is usually treated in connection with panic disorder. Commonly, members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the minor tranquilizer (''benzodiazepine'') groups of medications are used in treatment. Examples of SSRI medications include ''vortioxetine'' (''Brintellix''), vilazodone (Viibryd), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), and ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''). The possible side effects of SSRI medications can vary greatly from person to person and depend on which of the ''drugs'' is being used. Common side effects of this group of medications include ''dry mouth'', sexual dysfunction, ''nausea'' or other stomach upset, ''tremors'', trouble sleeping, ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'' or soft stools, and dizziness. In rare cases, some people have been thought to become acutely more anxious or ''depressed'' once on the medication, even trying to or completing ''suicide'' or homicide. Children and ''teens'' are thought to be particularly vulnerable to this rare possibility. Phobias are also sometimes treated using ''beta-blocker'' medications, which block the effects of adrenaline (like rapid heartbeat, stomach upset, shortness of breath) on the body. An example of a beta-blocker medication is ''propranolol''.''Panic disorder and phobias are sometimes treated with drugs in a medication class known as benzodiazepines, also sometimes referred to as anxiolytics or ''sedatives''. This class of medications causes relaxation but is used less often these days to treat anxiety due to the possibility of addiction, increasing need for higher doses, and overdose. The risk of overdose is especially heightened if taken when alcohol is also being consumed. Examples of medications from that group include ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), and ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'').''As anything that is ingested carries the risk of possible side effects, it is important to work closely with a doctor to decide whether medication is appropriate, and if so, which medication would be best. Further, the treating doctor will likely closely monitor for the possibility of side effects that can vary from the minor to the severe and in rare cases may even be life-threatening.''A variety of mental-health specialists treat agoraphobia. In this age of managed care (involvement of insurance companies in determining payment for treatment), psychiatrists are often relegated to managing medication treatment for this condition despite the training these professionals receive in conducting therapy. Other mental-health prescribers, like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, may also provide medication management for this condition. Psychoanalysts of a variety of disciplines, as well as psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses, are some of the specialists that may conduct psychotherapy to treat agoraphobia.'  "
Are there home remedies for agoraphobia?,"'While people often explore and attempt to address anxiety with alternative treatments, sometimes described as home remedies, there remains a lack of large-scale, controlled scientific research to indicate a clear benefit of such interventions. Examples of oral alternative treatments include ''kava'', Rhodiola, and ''tryptophan''. Another challenge with these remedies is that there is little regulation of the doses and other ingredients for such substances. Lifestyle interventions that may help decrease anxiety include adhering to a healthy ''diet'', regular ''exercise'', engaging in meditation, and ''yoga''.' "
What are the complications of agoraphobia?,"'Agoraphobia increases the likelihood that the person will also suffer from another anxiety disorder, like social or other phobias, panic disorder or anxiety associated with ''posttraumatic stress disorder''. Agoraphobia also predisposes sufferers to having more severe and difficult to treat anxiety disorders of any kind. People with agoraphobia are more at risk for developing alcohol or other ''drug use'' disorders. Also, agoraphobia tends to occur more often in individuals who have a number of different physical conditions, like ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') and ''asthma'"". If not treated, agoraphobia may worsen to the point at which the person's life is seriously impacted by the disease itself and/or by attempts to avoid or hide it. In fact, some people have had problems with loved ones, failed in school, and/or lost jobs while trying to cope with severe agoraphobia or another severe phobia."" "
What is the prognosis for agoraphobia?,"'While there may be periods of spontaneous improvement of symptoms for people with agoraphobia, it does not usually go away unless the person receives treatment specifically for agoraphobia sufferers. Some research has indicated a more chronic and debilitating course of agoraphobia in African-American individuals compared to Caucasians. One significant challenge of agoraphobia is revealed by the statistics related to treatment. Specifically, less than half of individuals with this condition in the United States are receiving treatment at any one time. Further, alcoholics can be up to 10 times more likely to suffer from a phobia than those who do not have alcohol use disorder, and phobic individuals can be twice as likely to be addicted to alcohol as are people who have never been phobic.' "
Is it possible to prevent agoraphobia?,"""As agoraphobia often develops as a fearful reaction to having panic attacks, prevention of agoraphobia usually focuses on developing ways to cope with the anxiety about the possibility of another panic attack without avoiding leaving one's home. The treatments for agoraphobia previously described are usually used to prevent its development, as well."" "

What are causes and risk factors for HIV and AIDS?,"'The cause for HIV infection is the human immunodeficiency virus; it is spread by person-to-person contact mainly by body fluids during unprotected sex and/or the use of needles contaminated with the human immunodeficiency virus. Other less frequent ways HIV is transmitted are through contaminated blood or tissue during a transfusion or transplant, to a fetus by an infected mother, or to an infant via ''breast milk'' from an infected mother.'""The cause of AIDS is infection by human immunodeficiency viruses that eventually damage the person's immune system so severely that the person develops additional medical problems like opportunistic infections or cancers.""'The risk factors for HIV and AIDS include''However, AIDS has an additional risk factor; it is increased in people who do not treat HIV infection or live in areas where there is an epidemic or endemic presence of HIV infections without good treatment centers available (for example, in sub-Saharan Africa).' unprotected sexual contact, using contaminated needles, mother-to-child transmission, having a large number of sexual partners, a history of sexually transmitted diseases, and receipt of blood transfusions before 1985 in the U.S."
What are the signs and symptoms of HIV and AIDS?,"'The initial infection by a human immunodeficiency virus strain may or may not produce symptoms. Acute HIV infections may cause ''flu-like symptoms'' about two to four weeks after infection. HIV infections may produce ''flu-like'' illness with ''fever'', ''weakness'', and a generalized ''rash''. ''Enlarged lymph nodes'"" commonly occur and are often the first indication of HIV infection. There are no specific physical findings for HIV infections; the patient's history is important because if they have had exposure to any risk factors as described above, the doctor will probably do some additional tests for HIV infection, which are listed below.""'AIDS signs and symptoms may include all of the above because these patients are infected first with human immunodeficiency virus. However, AIDS signs and symptoms are more severe and can result in recurrent life-threatening infections with opportunistic viruses and bacteria and/or cancers with worsening symptoms if the patient has additional medical problems like ''diabetes''. In addition, patients can develop AIDS-associated ''dementia'', ''encephalopathy'', and a wasting syndrome (severe ''weight loss'' and ''diarrhea'').' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose HIV and AIDS?,"'Screening tests are recommended for patients who are at risk for developing HIV and AIDS.''Antibody tests were traditionally used to diagnose HIV. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (''ELISA'') blood test was used for screening for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus as evidence of infection. Another blood test, the Western blot assay, was then used to confirm HIV infections.''There are also ''newer combined HIV tests'"" that can detect HIV infection up to 20 days earlier than antibody screening tests. These are called combined antigen/antibody tests that look for the presence of a protein called p24 that's part of the virus that shows up two to four weeks after infection, as well as HIV antibodies. These combined tests are now recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).""'Another type of diagnostic test, the nucleic acid test (NAT), identifies the genetic material of the human immunodeficiency virus. The NAT can detect HIV infection about seven to 28 days after infection with HIV, but these tests are very expensive and not used for routine HIV screening.''If a person is diagnosed with an HIV infection, health care providers suggest the patient be screened for additional infectious diseases (for example, ''syphilis'', ''cytomegalovirus'', tuberculosis, and others) and/or other diseases that might indicate AIDS.''The diagnosis of AIDS is more complex than HIV diagnosis. One major blood test for the diagnosis of AIDS is the CD4 T-cell count. Human immunodeficiency viruses can destroy an immune cell type termed CD4 cells, a T-cell type in our immune system. When an HIV-infected patient has a CD-4 cell count of <200/µl, they are considered to have AIDS; when CD4 counts reach these low levels, patients often show one or more of the symptoms or signs (sometimes termed as an AIDS-defining illness) for AIDS listed above.' "
What are treatments and medications for HIV and AIDS?,"""Treatments and medications are best managed by an infectious disease consultant who will design a treatment program for the individual's problems. In general, all patients with a history of AIDS with a low CD4 count should be treated with antiviral ""'drugs''. You and your physicians should discuss treatment and/or medication options that will best fit your circumstances.' "
What is the prognosis of HIV and AIDS?,"'In patients with untreated human immunodeficiency virus infections, the overall prognosis is poor, with life span ranging about eight to 10 years after initial infection. Once the infection has progressed and the diagnosis of AIDS occurs, the survival time is about two years in untreated patients. However, remarkable progress has taken place since HIV infections became common worldwide; treatment with antiviral drug therapy has increased survival times. In addition, aggressive antiviral therapy can delay the onset of AIDS for many years. Consequently, treated individuals have a much better chance for a relatively ''longer life'' span and better prognosis if they undergo and adhere to therapeutic protocols. Individuals with HIV can live a long time; however, their life spans average somewhat less than normal. Future treatments may allow an HIV-infected person to live a normal life span.' "
Is it possible to prevent HIV and AIDS?,"'It is possible to prevent HIV and AIDS by avoiding all of the risk factors that result in transmission of the virus. For example, drug users should never share needles. Medical personnel need to follow disease-control methods for disposal of medical instruments and needles. ''Safe sex'' practices with sexual partners who have HIV infection are some of the methods to prevent both HIV and AIDS.''According to the CDC, there is no ''vaccine'' currently available to prevent HIV and/or AIDS. However, research is going on to develop a vaccine; a vaccine trial termed HVTN 072 is currently under way to determine if an experimental vaccine regimen can safely prevent HIV infection among South-African adults. Positive results from this trial would be an important step forward in prevention of HIV and AIDS.' "
What are the effects of alcohol?,"'Chemically, alcohol tends to decrease the chemical activity of substances that affect the nervous system, to inhibit behavior (gamma-aminobutyric acid, also called GABA signaling), and increase the activity of pleasure-seeking processes (glutamate). That can result in people being less inhibited in their words and actions and more likely to engage in immediately pleasurable activities even if they are unsafe. Even light drinkers can experience shrinking of parts of the brain. Intoxication with alcohol can be characterized by''Potentially positive effects of alcohol consumed in moderation include' slurred speech, clumsiness, sleepiness, headaches, distorted senses, lapses in memory, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. decreased risk of developing gallstones, diabetes, heart attack, and certain causes of stroke."
What is alcohol abuse?,"""Alcohol abuse, now included in the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, is a disease. While many have described this disorder as dipsomania, the latter term more accurately describes the intense craving that can be a symptom of alcohol use disorder. A maladaptive pattern of drinking alcohol that results in negative work, medical, legal, educational, and/or social effects on a person's life characterizes the disorder. The individual who abuses this substance tends to continue to use it despite such consequences. Effects of alcohol use disorder on families can include increased domestic abuse/""'domestic violence''. The effects that parental alcoholism can have on children can be significantly detrimental in other ways as well. For example, the sons and daughters of alcoholics seem to be at higher risk for experiencing feelings that are more negative, ''stress'', and alienation as well as ''aggression''. There are a multitude of negative psychological effects of alcohol use disorder, including ''depression'' and antisocial behaviors.''Statistics about less severe alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse) in the Unites States include its afflicting about 10% of women and 20% of men. Other alcohol abuse facts and statistics include the following:' Most people who develop severe alcohol use disorder (alcohol dependence/addiction) do so between 18 and 25 years of age. Symptoms tend to alternate between periods of alcohol abuse and abstinence (relapse and remission) over time. The majority of individuals who abuse alcohol never go on to develop severe alcohol use disorder, formerly referred to as alcohol dependence. Alcohol-use statistics by country indicate that among European countries, Mediterranean countries have the highest rate of abstinence and that wine-producing countries tend to have the highest rates of alcohol consumption. In many European countries, beer tends to be the alcoholic beverage of choice by teenagers, followed by liquor over wine."
What is alcoholism (alcoholic)?,"""Alcoholism formerly called alcohol dependence or alcohol addiction, is the more severe end of the alcohol use disorder spectrum. It is a destructive pattern of alcohol use that includes tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance, using more alcohol or using it for longer than planned, and trouble reducing its use or inability to use it in moderation. Other potential symptoms include spending an inordinate amount of time getting, using, or recovering from the use of alcohol, compromised functioning, and/or continuing to use alcohol despite an awareness of the detrimental effects it is having on one's life.""'Alcoholism is appropriately considered a disease rather than a ''weakness'' of character or chosen pattern of bad behavior. It is the third most common ''mental illness'', affecting more than 14 million people in the United States. Other facts and statistics about alcohol dependence include its pattern of afflicting about 4% of women and 10% of men. It costs more than $200 billion per year in lower productivity, early death, and costs for treatment. Worldwide, alcohol is thought to contribute to more than 200 illnesses and injuries, like ''liver disease'', ''heart disease'', and neurological problems. Alcohol-related deaths number more than 3 million per year, nearly 6% of all deaths worldwide. For adults between 20-40 years of age, that percentage rises to about 25% of deaths due to alcohol.' "
What differentiates alcohol abuse from alcoholism?,"'While both alcohol abuse and alcoholism are included in the alcohol use disorder diagnosis and involve engaging in maladaptive behaviors in the use of alcohol, abuse of this substance does not include the person having withdrawal symptoms or needing more and more amounts to achieve intoxication (tolerance) unless the person has developed alcoholism (alcoholic).'  "
What are risk factors for alcoholism?,"'Risk factors for developing a drinking problem include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or another mood problem in the individual, as well as having parents with addiction. Low self-esteem and feeling out of place are other risk factors for developing alcohol dependence. In women, antisocial behaviors and ''impulsivity'' are associated with the development of severe alcohol use disorder. Both men and women are more likely to develop alcoholism if they have a childhood history of being physically or sexually abused. Children and teens who have their first drink of alcohol between 11 and 14 years of age are more at risk for developing drinking alcohol problems than those who do so when either younger or older.' "
What causes alcoholism? Is alcoholism hereditary?,"'One frequently asked question about alcoholism is if it is hereditary. As with most other mental disorders, alcohol addiction has no one single cause and is not directly passed from one generation to another in families. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.' "
"What are alcohol use disorder symptoms and signs in teenagers, women, men, and the elderly?","""Signs that indicate a person is intoxicated include the smell of alcohol on their breath or skin, glazed or bloodshot eyes, the person being unusually passive or argumentative, and/or a deterioration in the person's appearance, judgment, or hygiene. Other physical symptoms of the state of being drunk include flushed skin. Cognitively, the person may experience decreased ability to pay attention and a propensity toward ""'memory loss''.''Alcohol, especially when consumed in excess, can affect teens, women, men, and the elderly quite differently. Women and the elderly tend to have higher blood concentrations of alcohol compared to men and younger individuals who drink the same amount. Alcoholic women are more at risk for developing physical health problems like ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'' and ''heart'' and nerve damage at a faster rate than alcohol-dependent men. Interestingly, men and women seem to have similar learning and memory problems as the result of excessive alcohol intake, but again, women tend to develop those problems twice as fast as men.''Elderly people who drink excessively are at risk for having more serious illnesses, doctor visits, and symptoms of ''depression'', with less life satisfaction and smaller social support networks compared to senior citizens who have never consumed alcohol. While binge drinking is often thought to be a symptom of young people, an often unknown fact is that a significant percentage of middle-aged and elderly individuals also engage in binge drinking. This behavior increases the risk for driving drunk, no matter what the age. That, in turn, puts the individual at risk for being arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol.''Teenagers who consume alcohol excessively have been found to be at risk for abnormal organ development as the possible result of the hormonal abnormalities caused by alcohol. This is particularly a risk to their developing reproductive system. Just a few of the other many dangerous effects of alcohol abuse and alcoholism in teenagers include the following:'   In contrast to adults, teens tend to abuse alcohol simultaneously with other substances, usually marijuana. Male teens who engage in heavy drinking tend to complete fewer years of education compared to male teens who do not drink. The younger a person is when they begin drinking, the more likely they are to develop a problem with alcohol. Each year, almost 2,000 people under 21 years of age die in car crashes in which underage drinking is involved. Alcohol is involved in nearly half of all violent deaths involving teens. More than three times the number of eighth-grade girls who drink heavily said they have attempted suicide compared to girls in that grade who do not drink. Teens who drink are more likely to engage in sexual activity, have unprotected sex, have sex with a stranger, or be the victim or perpetrator of a sexual assault. Excess alcohol use can cause other emotional problems or mask other co-occurring emotional problems, like anxiety or depression. Drinking in excess can lead to the use of other drugs, like marijuana, cocaine, or heroin."
How do physicians diagnose alcohol use disorder?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has an alcohol-use disorder. Screening tools, including online or other tests may help identify individuals who are at risk for having a drinking problem. Therefore, health care professionals diagnose alcohol abuse or dependence by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might have mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from alcohol or other ''drug abuse'' or dependence disorders, as well as depression and/or ''manic'' symptoms, ''anxiety'', ''hallucinations'', or ''delusions'' or behavioral disorders. Physicians may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for substance-use disorders. Since some of the symptoms of alcohol use disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from a mood disorder or ''anxiety disorder'', as well as ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'', or personality or behavior disorders like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').' "
"What are the stages of alcohol 
use disorder?","'Five stages of alcohol and ''substance abuse'' disorders have been identified. The first stage is described as having access to alcohol rather than use of alcohol. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a person more vulnerable to using alcohol are an issue. The second stage of alcohol use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of alcohol. This or any of the more severe stages of alcoholism may involve binge drinking. The third stage is characterized by individuals further increasing the frequency of alcohol use and/or using the substance on a regular basis. This stage may also include either buying or stealing to get alcohol. In the fourth stage of alcohol use, users have established regular alcohol consumption, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated (""high"") and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of alcohol use is defined by the person only feeling normal when they are using alcohol. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, engaging in physical fights, or driving while intoxicated increase, and they become most vulnerable to having ''suicidal thoughts''.' "
What is the treatment for alcohol use disorder?,"'Prior to entering any inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program for alcohol use disorder, the possibility that the person with this disorder could suffer from physical ''symptoms of alcohol withdrawal'' needs to be addressed. People who have a pattern of extensive alcohol abuse are at risk for developing a potentially fatal set of withdrawal symptoms (''delirium'' tremens or DTs) that may include irregular heartbeat, ''sweating'', high ''fever'', shaking/''tremors'', hallucinations, and even fatal ''seizures'', three days after withdrawal symptoms begin. Those individuals will need to enter a detoxification (detox) program that includes the use of close medical support, monitoring, and prescription of medications like ''chlordiazepoxide'' (''Librium'') or ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'') to help prevent and ease the symptoms of ''alcohol withdrawal''.''Given the malnutrition that many alcoholics suffer from, gradual correction of that condition is also important, both to prevent or correct the consequences of malnutrition (like low ''thiamine'' level) and to prevent the potential results of correcting ''nutrition'' problems too rapidly. One example of the latter is that people with chronic alcohol-induced low sodium levels in the bloodstream (''hyponatremia'') are at risk for severe neurological problems due to a loss of the outer, insulating covering of nerve cells in parts of the brain (central pontine myelinolysis) if low sodium levels are corrected too rapidly.''There are numerous individual psychotherapeutic treatments for alcohol addiction. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of alcohol altogether. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, like helping the individual with alcohol use disorder recognize what tends to precede and follow their episodes of alcohol use, are often used to address alcohol abuse. Some treatment programs include drug testing. Twelve-step recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the person suffering from alcohol use disorder to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to an intervention that teaches the alcohol-use disordered person to stay away from situations that are associated with alcohol use and to replace those situations with activities that are alcohol-free and otherwise contrary to using alcohol. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug or alcohol use.'""Friends and family members of alcoholic individuals have often developed a codependent relationship with the substance abuser. Specifically, they often feel compelled to either help their loved one secure alcohol or to repair situations caused by the alcoholic's alcohol use. Social control involves family members and other significant others of the alcoholic in treatment.""'For people in the first stage of alcohol use (having access but not having yet used alcohol), preventive measures are used. Therefore, limiting access to alcohol or other drugs, addressing any risk factors of the alcohol consumer or family, as well as optimal parental supervision for youth and expression regarding expectations are often recommended. The approach to those who have experimented with alcohol should not be minimized by mental health professionals, since infrequent use can progress to the more serious stages of alcohol use if not addressed. Therefore, professionals recommend that the alcohol-consuming individual be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of alcohol, that fair but firm limits be set on the use of alcohol, and that the user be referred for brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. People who have progressed to the more advanced stages of alcoholism are typically treated intensively, using a combination of the medical, individual, and familial interventions already described.''While group therapy can help teens stay sober, groups that include a number of teens who also engage in disordered behaviors can actually tend to increased alcohol use in this age group. Family interventions for alcoholism that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment, often called rehab, of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating alcohol use disorder in teens.'  "
"What medications 
treat alcohol use disorder?","'There are few medications that are considered effective in treating moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. Naltrexone (Trexan, Revia, or Vivitrol) has been found effective in managing this illness. It is the most frequently used medication in treating alcohol use disorder . It decreases the alcoholic\'s cravings for alcohol by blocking the body\'s euphoric (""high"") response to it. Naltrexone is either taken by mouth on a daily basis or through monthly injections. ''Disulfiram'' (''Antabuse'"") is prescribed for about 9% of alcoholics. It decreases the alcoholic's craving for the substance by producing a negative reaction to drinking. Acamprosate (""'Campral'') works by decreasing cravings for alcohol in those who have stopped drinking. ''Ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') has been found to be effective in treating alcohol use disorder in people whose problem drinking began before they were 25 years old. None of these medications have been specifically approved to treat alcoholism in people less than 18 years of age. ''Baclofen'' (''Lioresal'') has been found to be a potentially effective treatment to decrease alcohol cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Some research indicates that psychiatric medications like ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid'') and ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft'') may be useful in decreasing alcohol use in people who have another mental health disorder in addition to alcohol use disorder.' "
How can you tell if someone has a drinking problem?,"'Signs of a drinking problem include behaviors like drinking for the purpose of getting drunk, drinking alone or keeping it secret, drinking to escape problems, hiding alcohol in odd places, getting irritated when you are unable to obtain alcohol to drink, and having problems at work, school, home, or legally as a result of your drinking. Other warning signs of alcohol use disorder include losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, having ''blackouts'' because of heavy drinking, and getting annoyed when loved ones say you may have a drinking problem. Behaviors that may indicate that a person is suffering from alcoholism include being able to drink more and more alcohol, trouble stopping once you start drinking, powerful urges to drink, and having withdrawal symptoms like nervousness, ''nausea'', shaking, or having ''cold'"" sweats, and even hallucinations when you don't have a drink."" "
Can an alcoholic just cut back or stop drinking?,"'While some people with alcohol use disorder can cut back or stop drinking without help, most are only able to do so temporarily unless they get treatment. Individuals who consume alcohol in lower amounts and tend to cope with problems more directly are more likely to be successful in their efforts to cut back or stop drinking without the benefit of treatment.' "
Is there a safe level of drinking?,"'Recent research describes potential health benefits of consuming alcohol, including decreased risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''dementia''. Given that, it is fair to say that low intake, along the lines of 4-8 ounces of wine per day, is likely safe.' "
Is it safe to drink alcohol while pregnant?,"'Babies'' who are born to mothers who are heavy drinkers are more at risk for being born with significant medical, developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems, including ''fetal alcohol syndrome'' (''FAS''). However, many babies whose mothers consumed even minimal amounts of alcohol during pregnancy have been born with such problems. Therefore, there is no amount of alcohol intake that has been proven to be safe during pregnancy.' "

"What are the long-term physical, psychological, and social effects of alcohol use disorder?","'The long-term effects of alcohol use disorder can be devastating and even life-threatening. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can negatively affect virtually every organ system. Specific examples of alcohol-use disorder effects on the body include everything from general effects like poor coordination, thiamine deficiency, and other forms of poor ''nutrition'', cardiovascular effects like ''hypertension'' and irregular heartbeat, reproductive effects like ''impotence'' and irregular menses, as well as gastrointestinal problems like ''jaundice'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''pancreatitis''. Alcohol-use disorder complications that involve the brain include, but are by no means limited to, ''strokes'', ''confusion'', and ''amnesia''. Thiamine deficiency that is associated with alcohol use disorder can progress to the point that the sufferer develops vision problems, confusion, and trouble ''walking'"" (Wernicke's ""'encephalopathy''), eventually followed by trouble caring for themselves and memory problems that the person tries to cover for by making things up/confabulating information (Korsakoff syndrome).''Approximately 10%-15% of people with alcoholism tend to commit ''suicide''. Intoxication is associated with suicide attempts using more lethal methods, and positive blood-alcohol levels are often found in people who complete suicide. Men who have lost their spouses within the year are at highest risk of suicide.''Socially, people who suffer from alcohol use disorder are at risk for poor school performance leading to school failure or dropping out; poor work performance leading to unemployment and family problems, including divorce and ''domestic violence''.' "
"What is codependency, and what is the treatment for codependency?","""Codependency is the tendency to interact with another person in an excessively passive or caretaking manner that negatively affects the quality of the codependent individual's life. The codependent person has a pattern of putting their own needs below those of others, likely has low self-esteem, and tends to engage in denial, excessive compliance, and control. Individuals who are codependent are at risk for engaging in addictive behaviors, including alcoholism, drug or ""'sexual addiction'', as well as ''eating disorders'' or self-destructive or other self-defeating behaviors. ''Psychotherapy'' and participation in support groups are the usual treatments for codependency.' "
"Is it possible to prevent alcohol use 
disorder?","""Clear communication by parents about the negative effects of alcohol, as well as about their expectations regarding drug use, has been found to significantly decrease alcohol use in teens. Adequate parental supervision has also been found to be a deterrent to underage alcohol abuse. Alcohol, and other drug use, has been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately after school and prior to parents' arrival at home from work. Teen participation in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed to be an important prevention measure for the use of alcohol in this age group. Parents can also help educate teens about appropriate coping and ""'stress''-management strategies. For example, 15- to 16-year-olds who use religion to cope with stress tend to use drugs significantly less often and have fewer problems as a result of drinking than their peers who do not use religion to cope.''Factors for preventing alcohol use disorder in older teenagers and young adults include limiting the availability of alcohol and enforcing rules that address issues like drinking and driving. Specific examples of limiting the accessibility of alcohol might involve raising the cost of alcohol and restricting when and where alcohol can be consumed.' "
"What is the prognosis of alcohol 
use disorder?","'With treatment, about 70% of people with alcoholism are able to decrease the number of days they consume alcohol and improve their overall health status within six months. On the other hand, most individuals who have been treated for a moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder have relapsed at least once during the first year after treatment. Those individuals seem to drink less often and lower amounts after receiving treatment compared with before treatment.' "
How much alcohol do teens use?,"'Alcohol is the most frequently used drug by teenagers in the United States. Significant statistics regarding alcohol use in ''teens'' include that about half of junior high and senior high school students drink alcohol on a monthly basis, and 14% of teens have been intoxicated at least once in the past year. Nearly 8% of teens who drink say they drink at least five or more alcoholic ''drinks'' in a row (binge drink).' "
What are the dangerous effects of alcohol use in teens?,"'Just a few of the many dangers of alcohol use in teens include the following:' Alcohol decreases teens' ability to pay attention. Teens who have experienced alcohol withdrawal tend to have difficulties with memory. The teenage brain exposed to alcohol is at risk for being smaller in certain parts. In contrast to adults, teens tend to abuse alcohol with other substances, usually marijuana. Male teens who drink heavily tend to complete fewer years of education compared to male teens who do not. The younger a person is when they begin drinking, the more likely they are to develop a problem with alcohol. Each year, almost 2,000 people under the age of 21 die in car crashes in which underage drinking is involved. Alcohol is involved in nearly half of all violent deaths involving youth. In 2016, 58% of teen drivers killed in motor-vehicle crashes after drinking and driving were not wearing a seat belt. More than three times the number of eighth-grade girls who drink heavily said they have attempted suicide compared to girls in that grade who do not drink. Intoxication is associated with suicide attempts using more lethal methods, and positive blood alcohol levels are often found in people who complete suicide. Teens who drink are more likely to engage in sexual activity, have unprotected sex, have sex with a stranger, or be the victim or perpetrator of a sexual assault. Excess alcohol use can cause or mask other emotional problems, like anxiety or depression. Drinking in excess can lead to the use of other drugs, like marijuana, cocaine, or heroin."

Since effective treatment of ''teen depression'' can be a deterrent to alcohol use, parents who seek help for their ''depressed'' teen in a timely manner can also help prevent their adolescent from engaging in underage drinking.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of alcohol intoxication?,"""Signs that indicate a person is intoxicated include the smell of alcohol on their breath or skin, glazed or bloodshot eyes, the person being unusually passive or argumentative, having slurred speech, unsteady walk or poor coordination, and/or deterioration in the person's appearance or hygiene. Other symptoms of intoxication include flushed skin and ""'memory loss''; intoxication can result in ''coma'' in extreme instances.' "
What is alcoholism?,"'As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', a medical professional can make a diagnosis of alcoholism (formerly referred to as ''alcohol dependence'' and currently known as alcohol use disorder) when he or she determines that a negative pattern of alcohol use leading to a number of problems has been established. Those problems can include needing more alcohol to get intoxicated (tolerance), difficulties that occur when the effects of alcohol wear off (withdrawal), using more alcohol or for longer time than intended, and other life problems because of the use of alcohol.''There are five stages of alcohol and drug use. The first stage involves access to alcohol rather than use of alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, or other drugs. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a teenager more vulnerable to using alcohol are an issue. The second stage of alcohol and other drug use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, or other drugs. The third stage involves a youth further increasing the frequency of alcohol use and/or using alcohol and other drugs on a regular basis. This stage may also include the teenager buying alcohol or other drugs or stealing to get their drug of choice. In the fourth stage of alcohol and drug use, adolescents have established regular usage, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated (""high""), and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life due to use of the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of alcohol or other drug use involves the youth only feeling normal when they are using. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, engaging in physical fights, or driving under the influence of alcohol increase, and they become most vulnerable to having ''suicidal thoughts''.' "
What are the causes and risk factors of teen alcoholism?,"'Family risk factors for teenagers developing drinking problems include low levels of parental supervision or communication, family conflicts, inconsistent or severe parental discipline, and a family history of alcohol or ''drug abuse''. Individual risk factors include problems managing impulses, emotional instability, thrill-seeking behaviors, and perceiving the risk of using alcohol to be low. Poverty and neighborhood violence are community risk factors for teens to develop alcohol use disorder.''Girls who drink, as well as teens who begin drinking prior to 14 years of age and those whose mothers have drinking problems, are more likely to develop alcoholism. While boys are more likely to binge drink and incur alcohol-related offenses, girls more often describe drinking in an effort to cope with negative emotions or family problems and to drink due to peer pressure. Teen risk factors for alcoholism differ a bit between the 14- to 16-year-old and 16- to 18-year-old age groups, in that 16- to 18-year-olds tend to be less likely to drink in excess when they have a close relationship with their mothers.''Facts about the societal risk factors for adolescent alcoholism include peer pressure and the portrayal of teen drinking in the media.

Therefore, professionals recommend that the youth be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of alcohol, that fair but firm limits be set on the use of alcohol, and that the user attend brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. Teens who have progressed to the more advanced stages of alcoholism are typically treated intensively, using a combination of the medical, individual, and familial interventions already described.' "
What is the prognosis for alcoholism?,"""Without treatment, youth who drink excessively as teenagers are more likely to become problem drinkers as adults. Depending on the severity of alcohol misuse, the youth's prognosis can be significantly improved by interventions ranging from involving the teen's parents to having the teen participate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or more intensive treatments.""

What are the effects of alcohol?,"'Chemically, alcohol tends to decrease the chemical activity of substances that affect the nervous system, to inhibit behavior (gamma-aminobutyric acid, also called GABA signaling), and increase the activity of pleasure-seeking processes (glutamate). That can result in people being less inhibited in their words and actions and more likely to engage in immediately pleasurable activities even if they are unsafe. Even light drinkers can experience shrinking of parts of the brain. Intoxication with alcohol can be characterized by''Potentially positive effects of alcohol consumed in moderation include' slurred speech, clumsiness, sleepiness, headaches, distorted senses, lapses in memory, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. decreased risk of developing gallstones, diabetes, heart attack, and certain causes of stroke."
What is alcohol abuse?,"""Alcohol abuse, now included in the diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, is a disease. While many have described this disorder as dipsomania, the latter term more accurately describes the intense craving that can be a symptom of alcohol use disorder. A maladaptive pattern of drinking alcohol that results in negative work, medical, legal, educational, and/or social effects on a person's life characterizes the disorder. The individual who abuses this substance tends to continue to use it despite such consequences. Effects of alcohol use disorder on families can include increased domestic abuse/""'domestic violence''. The effects that parental alcoholism can have on children can be significantly detrimental in other ways as well. For example, the sons and daughters of alcoholics seem to be at higher risk for experiencing feelings that are more negative, ''stress'', and alienation as well as ''aggression''. There are a multitude of negative psychological effects of alcohol use disorder, including ''depression'' and antisocial behaviors.''Statistics about less severe alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse) in the Unites States include its afflicting about 10% of women and 20% of men. Other alcohol abuse facts and statistics include the following:' Most people who develop severe alcohol use disorder (alcohol dependence/addiction) do so between 18 and 25 years of age. Symptoms tend to alternate between periods of alcohol abuse and abstinence (relapse and remission) over time. The majority of individuals who abuse alcohol never go on to develop severe alcohol use disorder, formerly referred to as alcohol dependence. Alcohol-use statistics by country indicate that among European countries, Mediterranean countries have the highest rate of abstinence and that wine-producing countries tend to have the highest rates of alcohol consumption. In many European countries, beer tends to be the alcoholic beverage of choice by teenagers, followed by liquor over wine."
What is alcoholism (alcoholic)?,"""Alcoholism formerly called alcohol dependence or alcohol addiction, is the more severe end of the alcohol use disorder spectrum. It is a destructive pattern of alcohol use that includes tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance, using more alcohol or using it for longer than planned, and trouble reducing its use or inability to use it in moderation. Other potential symptoms include spending an inordinate amount of time getting, using, or recovering from the use of alcohol, compromised functioning, and/or continuing to use alcohol despite an awareness of the detrimental effects it is having on one's life.""'Alcoholism is appropriately considered a disease rather than a ''weakness'' of character or chosen pattern of bad behavior. It is the third most common ''mental illness'', affecting more than 14 million people in the United States. Other facts and statistics about alcohol dependence include its pattern of afflicting about 4% of women and 10% of men. It costs more than $200 billion per year in lower productivity, early death, and costs for treatment. Worldwide, alcohol is thought to contribute to more than 200 illnesses and injuries, like ''liver disease'', ''heart disease'', and neurological problems. Alcohol-related deaths number more than 3 million per year, nearly 6% of all deaths worldwide. For adults between 20-40 years of age, that percentage rises to about 25% of deaths due to alcohol.' "
What differentiates alcohol abuse from alcoholism?,"'While both alcohol abuse and alcoholism are included in the alcohol use disorder diagnosis and involve engaging in maladaptive behaviors in the use of alcohol, abuse of this substance does not include the person having withdrawal symptoms or needing more and more amounts to achieve intoxication (tolerance) unless the person has developed alcoholism (alcoholic).'  "
What are risk factors for alcoholism?,"'Risk factors for developing a drinking problem include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or another mood problem in the individual, as well as having parents with addiction. Low self-esteem and feeling out of place are other risk factors for developing alcohol dependence. In women, antisocial behaviors and ''impulsivity'' are associated with the development of severe alcohol use disorder. Both men and women are more likely to develop alcoholism if they have a childhood history of being physically or sexually abused. Children and teens who have their first drink of alcohol between 11 and 14 years of age are more at risk for developing drinking alcohol problems than those who do so when either younger or older.' "
What causes alcoholism? Is alcoholism hereditary?,"'One frequently asked question about alcoholism is if it is hereditary. As with most other mental disorders, alcohol addiction has no one single cause and is not directly passed from one generation to another in families. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors.' "
"What are alcohol use disorder symptoms and signs in teenagers, women, men, and the elderly?","""Signs that indicate a person is intoxicated include the smell of alcohol on their breath or skin, glazed or bloodshot eyes, the person being unusually passive or argumentative, and/or a deterioration in the person's appearance, judgment, or hygiene. Other physical symptoms of the state of being drunk include flushed skin. Cognitively, the person may experience decreased ability to pay attention and a propensity toward ""'memory loss''.''Alcohol, especially when consumed in excess, can affect teens, women, men, and the elderly quite differently. Women and the elderly tend to have higher blood concentrations of alcohol compared to men and younger individuals who drink the same amount. Alcoholic women are more at risk for developing physical health problems like ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'' and ''heart'' and nerve damage at a faster rate than alcohol-dependent men. Interestingly, men and women seem to have similar learning and memory problems as the result of excessive alcohol intake, but again, women tend to develop those problems twice as fast as men.''Elderly people who drink excessively are at risk for having more serious illnesses, doctor visits, and symptoms of ''depression'', with less life satisfaction and smaller social support networks compared to senior citizens who have never consumed alcohol. While binge drinking is often thought to be a symptom of young people, an often unknown fact is that a significant percentage of middle-aged and elderly individuals also engage in binge drinking. This behavior increases the risk for driving drunk, no matter what the age. That, in turn, puts the individual at risk for being arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol.''Teenagers who consume alcohol excessively have been found to be at risk for abnormal organ development as the possible result of the hormonal abnormalities caused by alcohol. This is particularly a risk to their developing reproductive system. Just a few of the other many dangerous effects of alcohol abuse and alcoholism in teenagers include the following:'   In contrast to adults, teens tend to abuse alcohol simultaneously with other substances, usually marijuana. Male teens who engage in heavy drinking tend to complete fewer years of education compared to male teens who do not drink. The younger a person is when they begin drinking, the more likely they are to develop a problem with alcohol. Each year, almost 2,000 people under 21 years of age die in car crashes in which underage drinking is involved. Alcohol is involved in nearly half of all violent deaths involving teens. More than three times the number of eighth-grade girls who drink heavily said they have attempted suicide compared to girls in that grade who do not drink. Teens who drink are more likely to engage in sexual activity, have unprotected sex, have sex with a stranger, or be the victim or perpetrator of a sexual assault. Excess alcohol use can cause other emotional problems or mask other co-occurring emotional problems, like anxiety or depression. Drinking in excess can lead to the use of other drugs, like marijuana, cocaine, or heroin."
How do physicians diagnose alcohol use disorder?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has an alcohol-use disorder. Screening tools, including online or other tests may help identify individuals who are at risk for having a drinking problem. Therefore, health care professionals diagnose alcohol abuse or dependence by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might have mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from alcohol or other ''drug abuse'' or dependence disorders, as well as depression and/or ''manic'' symptoms, ''anxiety'', ''hallucinations'', or ''delusions'' or behavioral disorders. Physicians may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for substance-use disorders. Since some of the symptoms of alcohol use disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from a mood disorder or ''anxiety disorder'', as well as ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'', or personality or behavior disorders like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'').' "
"What are the stages of alcohol 
use disorder?","'Five stages of alcohol and ''substance abuse'' disorders have been identified. The first stage is described as having access to alcohol rather than use of alcohol. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a person more vulnerable to using alcohol are an issue. The second stage of alcohol use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of alcohol. This or any of the more severe stages of alcoholism may involve binge drinking. The third stage is characterized by individuals further increasing the frequency of alcohol use and/or using the substance on a regular basis. This stage may also include either buying or stealing to get alcohol. In the fourth stage of alcohol use, users have established regular alcohol consumption, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated (""high"") and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of alcohol use is defined by the person only feeling normal when they are using alcohol. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, engaging in physical fights, or driving while intoxicated increase, and they become most vulnerable to having ''suicidal thoughts''.' "
What is the treatment for alcohol use disorder?,"'Prior to entering any inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation program for alcohol use disorder, the possibility that the person with this disorder could suffer from physical ''symptoms of alcohol withdrawal'' needs to be addressed. People who have a pattern of extensive alcohol abuse are at risk for developing a potentially fatal set of withdrawal symptoms (''delirium'' tremens or DTs) that may include irregular heartbeat, ''sweating'', high ''fever'', shaking/''tremors'', hallucinations, and even fatal ''seizures'', three days after withdrawal symptoms begin. Those individuals will need to enter a detoxification (detox) program that includes the use of close medical support, monitoring, and prescription of medications like ''chlordiazepoxide'' (''Librium'') or ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'') to help prevent and ease the symptoms of ''alcohol withdrawal''.''Given the malnutrition that many alcoholics suffer from, gradual correction of that condition is also important, both to prevent or correct the consequences of malnutrition (like low ''thiamine'' level) and to prevent the potential results of correcting ''nutrition'' problems too rapidly. One example of the latter is that people with chronic alcohol-induced low sodium levels in the bloodstream (''hyponatremia'') are at risk for severe neurological problems due to a loss of the outer, insulating covering of nerve cells in parts of the brain (central pontine myelinolysis) if low sodium levels are corrected too rapidly.''There are numerous individual psychotherapeutic treatments for alcohol addiction. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of alcohol altogether. Cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques, like helping the individual with alcohol use disorder recognize what tends to precede and follow their episodes of alcohol use, are often used to address alcohol abuse. Some treatment programs include drug testing. Twelve-step recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the person suffering from alcohol use disorder to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to an intervention that teaches the alcohol-use disordered person to stay away from situations that are associated with alcohol use and to replace those situations with activities that are alcohol-free and otherwise contrary to using alcohol. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug or alcohol use.'""Friends and family members of alcoholic individuals have often developed a codependent relationship with the substance abuser. Specifically, they often feel compelled to either help their loved one secure alcohol or to repair situations caused by the alcoholic's alcohol use. Social control involves family members and other significant others of the alcoholic in treatment.""'For people in the first stage of alcohol use (having access but not having yet used alcohol), preventive measures are used. Therefore, limiting access to alcohol or other drugs, addressing any risk factors of the alcohol consumer or family, as well as optimal parental supervision for youth and expression regarding expectations are often recommended. The approach to those who have experimented with alcohol should not be minimized by mental health professionals, since infrequent use can progress to the more serious stages of alcohol use if not addressed. Therefore, professionals recommend that the alcohol-consuming individual be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of alcohol, that fair but firm limits be set on the use of alcohol, and that the user be referred for brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. People who have progressed to the more advanced stages of alcoholism are typically treated intensively, using a combination of the medical, individual, and familial interventions already described.''While group therapy can help teens stay sober, groups that include a number of teens who also engage in disordered behaviors can actually tend to increased alcohol use in this age group. Family interventions for alcoholism that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment, often called rehab, of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating alcohol use disorder in teens.'  "
"What medications 
treat alcohol use disorder?","'There are few medications that are considered effective in treating moderate to severe alcohol use disorder. Naltrexone (Trexan, Revia, or Vivitrol) has been found effective in managing this illness. It is the most frequently used medication in treating alcohol use disorder . It decreases the alcoholic\'s cravings for alcohol by blocking the body\'s euphoric (""high"") response to it. Naltrexone is either taken by mouth on a daily basis or through monthly injections. ''Disulfiram'' (''Antabuse'"") is prescribed for about 9% of alcoholics. It decreases the alcoholic's craving for the substance by producing a negative reaction to drinking. Acamprosate (""'Campral'') works by decreasing cravings for alcohol in those who have stopped drinking. ''Ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') has been found to be effective in treating alcohol use disorder in people whose problem drinking began before they were 25 years old. None of these medications have been specifically approved to treat alcoholism in people less than 18 years of age. ''Baclofen'' (''Lioresal'') has been found to be a potentially effective treatment to decrease alcohol cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Some research indicates that psychiatric medications like ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid'') and ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft'') may be useful in decreasing alcohol use in people who have another mental health disorder in addition to alcohol use disorder.' "
How can you tell if someone has a drinking problem?,"'Signs of a drinking problem include behaviors like drinking for the purpose of getting drunk, drinking alone or keeping it secret, drinking to escape problems, hiding alcohol in odd places, getting irritated when you are unable to obtain alcohol to drink, and having problems at work, school, home, or legally as a result of your drinking. Other warning signs of alcohol use disorder include losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, having ''blackouts'' because of heavy drinking, and getting annoyed when loved ones say you may have a drinking problem. Behaviors that may indicate that a person is suffering from alcoholism include being able to drink more and more alcohol, trouble stopping once you start drinking, powerful urges to drink, and having withdrawal symptoms like nervousness, ''nausea'', shaking, or having ''cold'"" sweats, and even hallucinations when you don't have a drink."" "
Can an alcoholic just cut back or stop drinking?,"'While some people with alcohol use disorder can cut back or stop drinking without help, most are only able to do so temporarily unless they get treatment. Individuals who consume alcohol in lower amounts and tend to cope with problems more directly are more likely to be successful in their efforts to cut back or stop drinking without the benefit of treatment.' "
Is there a safe level of drinking?,"'Recent research describes potential health benefits of consuming alcohol, including decreased risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''dementia''. Given that, it is fair to say that low intake, along the lines of 4-8 ounces of wine per day, is likely safe.' "
Is it safe to drink alcohol while pregnant?,"'Babies'' who are born to mothers who are heavy drinkers are more at risk for being born with significant medical, developmental, behavioral, and emotional problems, including ''fetal alcohol syndrome'' (''FAS''). However, many babies whose mothers consumed even minimal amounts of alcohol during pregnancy have been born with such problems. Therefore, there is no amount of alcohol intake that has been proven to be safe during pregnancy.' "

"What are the long-term physical, psychological, and social effects of alcohol use disorder?","'The long-term effects of alcohol use disorder can be devastating and even life-threatening. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can negatively affect virtually every organ system. Specific examples of alcohol-use disorder effects on the body include everything from general effects like poor coordination, thiamine deficiency, and other forms of poor ''nutrition'', cardiovascular effects like ''hypertension'' and irregular heartbeat, reproductive effects like ''impotence'' and irregular menses, as well as gastrointestinal problems like ''jaundice'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''pancreatitis''. Alcohol-use disorder complications that involve the brain include, but are by no means limited to, ''strokes'', ''confusion'', and ''amnesia''. Thiamine deficiency that is associated with alcohol use disorder can progress to the point that the sufferer develops vision problems, confusion, and trouble ''walking'"" (Wernicke's ""'encephalopathy''), eventually followed by trouble caring for themselves and memory problems that the person tries to cover for by making things up/confabulating information (Korsakoff syndrome).''Approximately 10%-15% of people with alcoholism tend to commit ''suicide''. Intoxication is associated with suicide attempts using more lethal methods, and positive blood-alcohol levels are often found in people who complete suicide. Men who have lost their spouses within the year are at highest risk of suicide.''Socially, people who suffer from alcohol use disorder are at risk for poor school performance leading to school failure or dropping out; poor work performance leading to unemployment and family problems, including divorce and ''domestic violence''.' "
"What is codependency, and what is the treatment for codependency?","""Codependency is the tendency to interact with another person in an excessively passive or caretaking manner that negatively affects the quality of the codependent individual's life. The codependent person has a pattern of putting their own needs below those of others, likely has low self-esteem, and tends to engage in denial, excessive compliance, and control. Individuals who are codependent are at risk for engaging in addictive behaviors, including alcoholism, drug or ""'sexual addiction'', as well as ''eating disorders'' or self-destructive or other self-defeating behaviors. ''Psychotherapy'' and participation in support groups are the usual treatments for codependency.' "
"Is it possible to prevent alcohol use 
disorder?","""Clear communication by parents about the negative effects of alcohol, as well as about their expectations regarding drug use, has been found to significantly decrease alcohol use in teens. Adequate parental supervision has also been found to be a deterrent to underage alcohol abuse. Alcohol, and other drug use, has been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately after school and prior to parents' arrival at home from work. Teen participation in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed to be an important prevention measure for the use of alcohol in this age group. Parents can also help educate teens about appropriate coping and ""'stress''-management strategies. For example, 15- to 16-year-olds who use religion to cope with stress tend to use drugs significantly less often and have fewer problems as a result of drinking than their peers who do not use religion to cope.''Factors for preventing alcohol use disorder in older teenagers and young adults include limiting the availability of alcohol and enforcing rules that address issues like drinking and driving. Specific examples of limiting the accessibility of alcohol might involve raising the cost of alcohol and restricting when and where alcohol can be consumed.' "
"What is the prognosis of alcohol 
use disorder?","'With treatment, about 70% of people with alcoholism are able to decrease the number of days they consume alcohol and improve their overall health status within six months. On the other hand, most individuals who have been treated for a moderate to severe alcohol-use disorder have relapsed at least once during the first year after treatment. Those individuals seem to drink less often and lower amounts after receiving treatment compared with before treatment.' "
What is fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'In 1996, the Institute of Medicine defined fetal alcohol syndrome as ""a pattern of physical, behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in individuals exposed to alcohol while in the womb. The association between these findings and maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy is well documented. To establish the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, specific criteria must be met. These include (1) documentation of three characteristic facial abnormalities, (2) documentation of smaller than expected ''prenatal'' and/or postnatal length, weight, and head circumference growth parameters, and (3) documentation of central nervous system abnormalities including measurable reduction in brain growth and function and behavioral/academic abnormalities, (4) other ''congenital malformations'' of the ''heart'', kidneys, eyes, and ''hearing loss''. These criteria will be further described later in this article.' "
What causes fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Alcohol is rapidly transported via placental blood flow from mother to fetus and is known to cause ''miscarriage'' and birth defects. Within two hours of maternal ingestion, fetal alcohol blood levels are similar to maternal alcohol blood levels. There is no established relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and side effects sustained by the infant. This puzzling observation may reflect the maternal rate of alcohol breakdown via her ''liver''.''It has been observed that alcohol consumed at any time during pregnancy may be associated with severe and permanent consequences. First trimester pregnancy alcohol ingestion is linked to the characteristic facial abnormalities of FAS as well as a reduction of intrauterine growth rate. Alcohol consumption during the ''second trimester'' also contributes to lower IQ, growth retardation in length and birth weight, as well as cognitive deficits of reading, spelling, and math. ''Third trimester'' alcohol consumption amplifies retardation in birth length and ultimate adult height potential.' "
What are risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'The Surgeon General and the Secretary for Health and Human Services recommend total abstinence from alcohol for women planning pregnancy, at the time of ''conception'' and throughout the entire pregnancy. No safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been documented. Multiple other countries have established similar guidelines.''Other risk factors include the following:' Binge drinking (four or more drinks in one sitting) is more problematic than consumption of the same amount of alcohol spread out over time (such as four back-to-back drinks at one sitting vs. one drink per day for four days). Older maternal age (over 35 years old) African-American or Native-American ethnic groups and a listing of many varied background elements (lower socioeconomic status, smoking, unmarried, unemployed, use of illicit drugs, maternal history of sexual or physical abuse, history of incarceration, having a partner or family member who drinks heavily and experiencing psychological stress or having a mental health disorder)"
What are symptoms and signs of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Infants with the diagnostic criteria to establish fetal alcohol syndrome exhibit the following characteristic findings:'  Unique facial characteristics: a thin upper lip; a uniquely smooth ridge between the upper lip and nose (the ""philtrum""); and a smaller than normal space between the upper and lower eyelids (""palpebral fissure"") Growth delay: smaller than expected length, weight, and head circumference measurements during both intrauterine and post-birth growth Central nervous system abnormalities: (a) structural (small brain size and slower than expected growth); (b) functional (global developmental delay in motor skills, language acquisition and utilization, problems with attention/hyperactivity, social skill deficiencies, impaired memory and judgment, and poor impulse control, etc.) Children with fetal alcohol syndrome commonly have birth defects that include heart defects, as well as abnormalities of the kidneys, eyes, and hearing loss."
How do physicians diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'The risk for potential fetal alcohol syndrome is established during the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women are questioned regarding behavioral risk factors, including illicit drug usage, alcohol consumption, ''smoking'', and other high-risk behaviors. Several screening questionnaires may be utilized; these include (1) T-ACE, (2) TWEAK, and (3) AUDIT-C. There are several laboratory blood studies that may indicate recent use or repeated and excessive ''alcohol abuse''.''Prenatal indicators for potential alcohol use would note smaller than expected growth in length, weight, and head measurements. Slower than expected head growth is a reflection of subnormal brain growth. Once born, the above-noted facial changes will lead the pediatrician to consideration of the diagnosis of FAS. The myriad of developmental and cognitive delays discussed above will also stimulate consideration of FAS in children who are failing in cognitive advancement or with associated behavioral deficiencies.' "
"Are there other alcohol-related fetal abnormality patterns less severe than 
fetal alcohol syndrome?","'In addition to fetal alcohol syndrome, there are three other conditions associated with fetal exposure to alcohol. These include the following:' Requirements for partial FAS with confirmed maternal alcohol exposure: confirmed fetal alcohol exposure; characteristic facial abnormalities; either growth retardation, brain neurodevelopmental findings, other unexplained behavioral abnormalities and alcohol-related birth defects Requirements for alcohol-related birth defects: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure, birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders Requirements for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure and either neurodevelopmental abnormalities or other unexplained behavioral abnormalities"
What is the treatment for fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'While no cure exists for fetal alcohol syndrome, early intervention programs have been shown to lessen the impact of language, motor, and cognitive impairments. Such aggressive programs utilize physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and educational therapy to maximize benefit. Adolescents and adults may benefit from programs dealing with academic, legal, and psychiatric problems.' "
What are the complications and long-term effects of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Many of the issues faced by infants and children with FAS continue into adolescence and adulthood. These may include:''More unique to adolescents and adults are issues with sexual behavior, legal problems, and ''substance abuse''. It is often observed that the characteristic facial features noted in infancy and childhood seem to ""soften"" with age. A small-sized head and ''short stature'' do continue into adulthood.' problems with ""regulation"" (sleeping, attention, and arousal), learning disorders, impairment with vision and hearing, mental retardation, deficits in memory, reasoning, and judgment."
What is the prognosis of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'As noted in the above discussion, an individual with FAS may experience a lifelong litany of both physical and intellectual challenges. Early intervention programs and multi-therapy programs (including physical therapy) may often lessen the impact of the diagnosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome?,'Yes! Avoid all alcohol consumption while planning for conception and during pregnancy.' 
Is it safe to consume alcohol and breastfeed?,"'The concentration of alcohol in ''breast milk'' is very similar to maternal blood levels. Potential consequences include a reduction in breast milk consumption, alteration of ''newborn'' ''sleep'' and wake cycles, and possible delay of motor development at 1 year of age.' "

Childbirth class options introduction,"'Many women and couples desire to take part in formal classes as part of their birthing plan. While a number of class formats and emphasis is available, what they have in common is that they all prepare a mother for giving birth. Classes may cover techniques for non-drug ''pain management'' as well as information about ''labor and delivery''. ''Childbirth'' classes can also teach expectant women what to expect in the postpartum period. In addition, information regarding ''breastfeeding'' is commonly presented. ''While classes focused on birthing techniques commonly start around the seventh month of ''pregnancy'', other types of classes may start in early ''pregnancy''. Your health care professional can help you decide when and if a ''childbirth'"" class is a good option for you.

A cutting device is used to make a small incomplete flap across the ''cornea'"". While still attached at one side, the corneal flap is folded back to reveal the layer of tissue below. Another, very precise cut is made on the sub layer of tissue based on the person's glasses' prescription. After this cut, the corneal flap is placed back over the eye where it reattaches."" "
What Are the Advantages of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,'Compared to other vision repair surgeries:' The healing process for keratoplasty eye surgery is relatively quick It takes less time for stable vision to return Recovery period is more comfortable
What Are the Disadvantages of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'While keratoplasty eye surgery is a safe and effective surgery, it does have its disadvantages. They include:' For people with mild to moderate  nearsightedness, keratoplasty eye surgery is not as accurate as other eye procedures, meaning that its outcome is more difficult to predict. Keratoplasty eye surgery slightly increases a person's risk of developing an irregular  astigmatism."
What Are the Potential Side Effects of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'Aside from the above-mentioned disadvantages, side effects, though rare, do occur. These may include:' Glare Inability to wear contacts, sometimes permanently Infection Corneal scarring"
How Should I Prepare for Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'Before your keratoplasty eye surgery you will have met with a coordinator who will discuss with you what you should expect during and after the surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests will include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the keratoplasty eye surgery.''If you wear rigid ''gas'' permeable ''contact lenses'"", you should not wear them during the three weeks before keratoplasty eye surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to keratoplasty eye surgery. Be sure to bring your glasses to the surgery so your prescription can be reviewed. ""'On the day of your keratoplasty eye surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye ''makeup'"" or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the keratoplasty eye surgery needs to be postponed."" "
What Should I Expect After Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'The healing time from keratoplasty eye surgery is very rapid. It usually takes only about 24 hours to mend. But it may take a few weeks for your vision to finally stabilize.''Your doctor will give you eye drops to control inflammation, discomfort, and prevent infection.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.\t\t\t\t' "
What is alkaptonuria?,"'Alkaptonuria is an ''inherited'' condition that causes urine to turn black when exposed to air. Ochronosis, a buildup of dark pigment in connective tissues such as cartilage and skin, is also characteristic of the disorder. This blue-black pigmentation usually appears after age 30. People with alkaptonuria typically develop ''arthritis'', particularly in the spine and large joints, beginning in early adulthood. Other features of this condition can include ''heart'' problems, ''kidney stones'', and prostate stones.' "
How common is alkaptonuria?,"'This condition is rare, affecting 1 in 250,000 to 1 million people worldwide. Alkaptonuria is more common in certain areas of Slovakia (where it has an incidence of about 1 in 19,000 people) and in the Dominican Republic.' "
What genes are related to alkaptonuria?,"'Mutations in the HGD gene cause alkaptonuria.'""The HGD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase. This enzyme helps break down the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are important building blocks of proteins. Mutations in the HGD gene impair the enzyme's role in this process. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid, which is produced as phenylalanine and tyrosine are broken down, accumulates in the body. Excess homogentisic acid and related compounds are deposited in connective tissues, which causes cartilage and skin to darken. Over time, a buildup of this substance in the joints leads to arthritis. Homogentisic acid is also excreted in urine, making the urine turn dark when exposed to air."" "
"How do people inherit alkaptonuria?
","'This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).,"'Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (also called ALL or acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a ''cancer of the blood'' and bone marrow. This type of ''cancer'' usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.''ALL is the most common type of cancer in children.''In a healthy child, the bone marrow makes blood ''stem cells'' (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.''A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:''A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):''In a child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. The cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are not able to fight infection very well. These cells are cancer (leukemia) cells. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may lead to infection, ''anemia'', and easy bleeding.' Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body. Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding. White blood cells that fight infection and disease. B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses."
Signs of childhood ALL include fever and bruising.,"""These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by childhood ALL or by other conditions. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:"" Fever. Easy bruising or bleeding. Petechiae (flat, pinpoint, dark-red spots under the skin caused by bleeding). Bone or joint pain. Painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin. Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs. Weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale. Loss of appetite."
Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL.,"""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.""'Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:' Being exposed to x-rays before birth. Being exposed to radiation. Past treatment with chemotherapy. Having certain genetic conditions, such as:Down syndrome.Neurofibromatosis type 1.Bloom syndrome.Fanconi anemia.Ataxia-telangiectasia.Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (mutations in certain genes that stop DNA from repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age). Down syndrome. Neurofibromatosis type 1. Bloom syndrome. Fanconi anemia. Ataxia-telangiectasia. Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (mutations in certain genes that stop DNA from repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age). Having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes."
Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood ALL.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used to diagnose childhood ALL and find out if leukemia cells have spread to other parts of the body such as the brain or testicles:''The following tests are done on blood or the bone marrow tissue that is removed:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential: A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells and platelets.The number and type of white blood cells.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells and platelets. The number and type of white blood cells. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which the cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes. For example, in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. This is called the ""Philadelphia chromosome."" Immunophenotyping: A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see if they are lymphocytes or myeloid cells. If the cells are malignant lymphocytes (cancer) they are checked to see if they are B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Lumbar puncture: A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.This procedure is done after leukemia is diagnosed to find out if leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. Intrathecal chemotherapy is given after the sample of fluid is removed to treat any leukemia cells that may have spread to the brain and spinal cord. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. The chest x-ray is done to see if leukemia cells have formed a mass in the middle of the chest."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on:''Treatment options depend on:''For leukemia that relapses (comes back) after treatment, the prognosis and treatment options depend partly on the following:' How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after the first month of treatment. Age at the time of diagnosis, sex, race, and ethnic background. The number of white blood cells in the blood at the time of diagnosis. Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes with cancer. Whether the child has Down syndrome. Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid. The child's weight at the time of diagnosis and during treatment. Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Whether the child has standard-risk, high-risk, or very high-risk ALL. The age of the child at the time of diagnosis. Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes of lymphocytes, such as the Philadelphia chromosome. Whether the child was treated with steroids before the start of induction therapy. How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops during treatment. How long it is between the time of diagnosis and when the leukemia comes back. Whether the leukemia comes back in the bone marrow or in other parts of the body."
"In childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.","'There are three risk groups in childhood ALL. They are described as:''Other factors that affect the risk group include the following:''It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment. Children with high-risk or very high-risk ALL usually receive more anticancer ''drugs'' and/or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.' Standard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/µL at the time of diagnosis. High risk: Includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/µL or more at the time of diagnosis. Very high risk: Includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the genes, children who have a slow response to initial treatment, and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes. How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment. Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis."
Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated.,"'The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, spinal cord, testicles, or other parts of the body.''Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment.' "
There are different types of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,"'Different types of treatment are available for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.''Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:' Pediatrician. Hematologist. Medical oncologist. Pediatric surgeon. Radiation oncologist. Neurologist. Pathologist. Radiologist. Pediatric nurse specialist. Social worker. Rehabilitation specialist. Psychologist. Child-life specialist."
Children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"'Regular follow-up exams are very important. Treatment can cause side effects long after it has ended. These are called late effects.''Late effects of cancer treatment may include:'""Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.""'The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases:''Four types of standard treatment are used:''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.'""The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child's risk group. Children with high-risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.""'Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy.''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles. It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a stem cell transplant.'""Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes total-body irradiation, and then replacing the blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor. After the patient receives treatment, the donor's stem cells are given to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the patient's blood cells. The stem cell donor doesn't have to be related to the patient.""'Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and adolescents with ALL. It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses (comes back after treatment).''Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.''Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, which causes stem cells to become more white blood cells or blasts than the body needs. ''Imatinib'' mesylate is a TKI used in the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. ''Dasatinib'' and ruxolitinib are TKIs that are being studied in the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk ALL.''Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Blinatumomab and inotuzumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of refractory childhood ALL.''New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL.' Physical problems, including problems with the heart, blood vessels, liver, or bones, and fertility. When dexrazoxane is given with chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines, the risk of late heart effects is lessened. Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects. Second cancers (new types of cancer) or other conditions, such as brain tumors, thyroid cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Remission induction: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission. Consolidation/intensification: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of consolidation/intensification therapy is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a relapse. Maintenance: This is the third phase of treatment. The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
"Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.","'Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS. Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given.''These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy.''If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.' "
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.,"'This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.'""CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.""'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.''Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.''Bone marrow aspiration'' and biopsy is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working.' "

What is cellulitis?,"'Cellulitis'' is a type of ''skin infection'' caused by bacteria. It is a common but serious skin condition that needs urgent medical attention. In the United States, cellulitis affects around 14.5 million cases each year. Cellulitis can occur anywhere on the skin. In adults, however, the leg is commonly affected. Children usually get cellulitis on their face or neck. Cellulitis involves a deep bacterial infection affecting the deep layers of the skin and tissue underneath. Untreated cellulitis can spread to the deeper tissues through the blood and become life-threatening.''Cellulitis usually begins as a red and swollen skin. The affected area feels warm and painful to touch. Cellulitis may affect the normal skin, although it is usually preceded by a skin break or ''crack'' including the ones caused by an injury or surgery.' "
Who is at a risk for cellulitis?,"'Cellulitis is a common condition and may affect anyone regardless of age or gender. Because cellulitis involves the entry of bacteria through a breach in the skin, keeping wounds clean and covered with a bandage can reduce the risk of cellulitis.''Conditions that reduce a person’s immunity make them vulnerable to get cellulitis. Some of the risk factors for cellulitis are as follows:' Being middle-aged or older Being overweight or obese Having diabetes, especially when it is poorly controlled Having skin conditions such as eczema"
What causes cellulitis?,"'Cellulitis is caused by bacteria that may infect the skin at places where it is broken or cracked. Bacteria usually cause cellulitis by entering a ''wound'', scratch, or cut on the skin. Cellulitis may also follow an ''insect bite'' or an exposed hair root.''The bacteria that most commonly cause cellulitis are as follows:' Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep) Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep) Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)"
What are the symptoms of cellulitis?,"'Cellulitis typically begins as red, tense, and swollen skin. The ''symptoms of cellulitis'' include:''You must seek immediate medical help if:' Skin redness and tightness Swelling of the skin Tenderness Pain Warm skin Fever Chills Blistering Bruising Headache Weakness Red streaks from the original site of the cellulitis There is a high fever. The affected area is large and inflamed. You get fever, chills, or cold sweats. You get nausea or vomiting. There is drowsiness, confusion, or trouble concentrating. You get swollen nodes. There are palpitations (a rapid heart rate) You feel difficulty in breathing. If the affected area has numbness or tingling. The pain is intense. The skin appears bluish/black. Cellulitis affects the area around your eye(s) or behind the ear(s). You have long-term medical conditions such as diabetes or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
How is cellulitis treated?,"'Cellulitis is a serious condition, and a healthcare provider must be consulted for proper treatment.

"What are the ""players"" in the allergic cascade?","'Our body\'s immune system is designed to constantly be on the lookout for intruders. It has the ability to distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" (foreign substances, which it protects us from). Let us look at this complex process. For example, consider an exposure to ragweed pollen. Once in the body, the ragweed pollen is engulfed by the immune system\'s scouts, called antigen presenting cells (APC). These APC slice up the ragweed pollen into small fragments, which then combine with special proteins in the cell, called human leukocyte antigens (HLA). HLA function like a guideline to help the body distinguish ""self"" from ""non-self."" When combined with the HLA, the fragments become visible to a key player in the allergic cascade, the lymphocytes, which recognizes them as foreign. This ragweed pollen fragment-HLA combination is exposed on the surface of the APC in full view of these specialized white blood cells.''Note these basic concepts of types of important cells and messenger proteins of the immune reaction:''The term white blood cells, or leukocytes, is derived from the Greek words ""leukos"" meaning white and ""cytes"" meaning cells. The white blood cells are essential to the immune system and include the monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes.' Lymphocytes are white blood cells that play a key role in both immunity and allergy. They are divided into two types, the T and B lymphocytes. Each type is responsible for a particular branch of the immune system.It is the duty of the T-lymphocytes to be ready to directly shift into action to attack foreign substances (cell-mediated immunity). Some T-lymphocytes are experts at ""killing"" (cytotoxic or killer T cells) while others assist the immune response and are termed ""helper"" cells (TH cells). The TH cells are further divided into TH1 (infection fighters) and TH2 (allergy promoters), depending on the proteins they release.The partners of the T-lymphocytes are the B-lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes are tiny antibody factories that produce antibodies to help destroy foreign substances when stimulated to do so by the TH cells.

Basophils and eosinophils are other white blood cells that play an important role in allergy. T cells often call these cells into action in allergic conditions. Blood levels of eosinophils are commonly elevated in people with asthma and other allergic diseases. Cytokines are a diverse group of proteins that are released by lymphocytes and macrophages in response to an injury or activation, such as by an allergen. They act as chemical signals that ""step up"" or ""step down"" the immune reaction."
"What about a more detailed look at the ""players""?","""Lymphocytes -- T's & B's:""' Lymphocytes are part of the white blood cell family and consist of T and B varieties. Each T lymphocyte, or T cell, is like a specially trained detective. The T cell examines the evidence that is exposed by the APC. When specific T cells come into contact with the ragweed pollen fragment on the APC and recognize it as foreign, an army of specialized T cells called ""helper"" cells (actually TH2 cells) is triggered, thus releasing chemicals (cytokines) that stimulate B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes produce IgE antibodies that bind to the allergens (such as the pollen fragment).''Once the IgE is produced, it specifically recognizes the ragweed pollen and will recognize it on future exposure.''The balance between allergy-promoting TH2 cells and infection-fighting TH1 cells has been found to be a critical component of our immune system. Whereas allergy reactions involve large numbers of TH2 cells, infections generate an army of TH1 cells, which then release chemicals that help destroy microbes.''Allergy and ''asthma'' rates have been increasing in recent decades. One theory called the ""hygiene hypothesis"" explains the increase as a consequence of inadequately ""geared up"" human immune systems because of the relatively sterilized environment of modern man, possibly due to antibiotics and ''vaccinations'"". What this concept implies is that the immune system of individuals who have been exposed to sufficient microbes make TH1 cells when stimulated. But if an individual's immune system is inadequately stimulated to produce TH1 cells by exposure to microbes, it will instead lean toward the allergy-producing system and make TH2 cells. A tendency toward allergic reactions is the result.""'Although this appears complicated, an understanding of the different lymphocyte responses is important in treating ''allergies''. Ideally, we would like to respond to ragweed pollen with TH1 lymphocytes and not TH2 lymphocytes, which promote allergic reactions and produce IgE in large amounts. Allergic individuals summon a large number of TH2 cells in response to allergens, whereas non-allergic people do not.''Finally, the tendency to develop allergic conditions (for example, to develop strong TH2 responses to allergens) is thought to be partially ''inherited'' from our parents. At birth, there seems to be a balance between the infection-fighting TH1 cells and the allergy-promoting TH2 cells. Current thinking is that allergy develops after birth when a child is exposed to certain substances in the environment. The immune system is stimulated by these exposures so that the scales are now tipped toward the production of allergy-promoting TH2 cells. They are especially tipped toward allergy promotion in individuals that have inherited the genetic tendency from their parents.''Mast cells & basophils'': Mast cells and basophils are the next key players in the allergic cascade. They are volatile cells with potentially explosive behavior. Mast cells reside in tissues while basophils are found in the blood. Each of these cells has over 100,000 receptor sites for IgE, which binds on their surfaces. The binding of IgE to these cells acts like the fuse on a bomb. The cells are now sensitized or primed with the IgE. When this allergic or sensitized individual is exposed to ragweed pollen again, the IgE is ready to bind to this pollen. When this occurs, the mast cells and basophils are activated and release a number of chemicals that ultimately produce the allergic reaction we can see and feel. Wherever these chemicals are released in the body will display the ''allergy symptoms''. In the ragweed pollen example, when the mast cells are activated in the nose by exposure to the pollen, the release of chemicals will likely result in ''sneezing'', ''nasal congestion'', and a ''runny nose'' -- the typical symptoms of ''hay fever''. Once sensitized, mast cells and basophils can remain ready to ignite with IgE for months or even years.''Chemical mediators'': Each mast cell and basophil may contain over 1000 tiny packets (granules). Each of these granules holds more than 30 allergy chemicals, called chemical mediators. Many of these chemical mediators are already prepared and are released from the granules as they burst in an allergic response. The most important of these chemical mediators is histamine. Once released into the tissues or blood stream, histamine attaches to histamine receptors (H1 receptors) that are present on the surface of most cells. This attachment results in certain effects on the blood vessels, mucous glands, and bronchial tubes. These effects cause typical allergic symptoms such as swelling, sneezing, and ''itching'' of the nose, throat, and roof of the mouth.''Some chemical mediators are not formed until five to 30 minutes after activation of the mast cells or basophils. The most prominent of these are the leukotrienes. Leukotriene D4 is 10 times more potent than histamine. Its effects are similar to those of histamine, but leukotriene D4 also attracts other cells to the area, thereby aggravating the inflammation.''The other group of inflammation-causing chemical mediators that form after mast cell stimulation is the prostaglandins. Prostaglandin D2, in particular, is a very potent contributor to the inflammation of the lung airways (bronchial tubes) in allergic asthma.' Leukotrienes were initially discovered in 1938 and were called the ""slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-A)."" Forty years later, Samuelsen in Sweden identified them as playing an important role in allergic inflammation. Recently, a new family of medicines, called leukotriene modifiers, have been found to be helpful in treating asthma. Examples are montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate)."
What are cytokines?,"'Cytokines are small proteins that can either step-up or step-down the immune response. One of the cytokines, interleukin 4 (IL4), is essential for the production of IgE antibodies. Interleukin 5 (IL5) and others are important in attracting other cells, particularly eosinophils, which then promote inflammation. This spectrum of cytokines is also released by the TH2 lymphocytes, thus further promoting allergic inflammation.' "
"What is the ""early phase"" of an allergic reaction?","'We have seen how the first encounter with ragweed pollen sensitizes the body with the help of lymphocytes and results in the IgE coating of the mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposure results in the immediate release of the chemical mediators that cause the various ''symptoms of allergy''. This process is the ""early phase"" of the allergic reaction. It can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. This is also known as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, which in this case is to the ragweed pollen allergen.''In the context of allergy, hypersensitivity refers to a condition in a previously exposed person in which tissue inflammation results from an immune reaction upon re-exposure to an allergen sensitizer.' "
"What is the ""late phase"" of an allergic reaction?","'About 50% of the time, the allergic reaction progresses into a ""late phase."" This late phase occurs about four to six hours after the exposure. In the late phase reaction, there is tissues redness and swelling due to the arrival of other cells to the area, including the eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Cytokines that are released by the mast cells and basophils act as tiny messengers to call these other cells to the area of inflammation. Additional cytokines are released by the TH2 lymphocytes and they attract even more of these cells of inflammation.''The eosinophils appear to be particularly troublesome cells of inflammation. Eosinophils evolved to defend the body against parasites, much like IgE. Nevertheless, they are often present in great numbers in the blood of people with ''allergies''. When they arrive at the site of the allergic reaction, they release chemicals that cause damage to the tissues and continue to promote the inflammation. Repeated episodes of this ""late phase"" reaction contribute to chronic allergic symptoms and make the tissues even more sensitive to subsequent exposure.' "
What are the symptoms and consequences of the allergic cascade?,"'When histamine is injected into the skin, a technique used in diagnosing ''allergies'', a reaction that can mimic an allergic reaction occurs. The histamine injection prompts the development of a pale, central swollen area that is caused by fluid leaking out of local blood vessels into the adjacent tissues. This localized reaction is called a ""wheal."" A red ""flare,"" which sometimes has a warm feeling due to inflammation, surrounds this ""wheal."" ''Itching'' occurs because histamine irritates the nerve endings in the skin.''This early or immediate response peaks at about 15 minutes and symptoms fade within 90 minutes. Sometimes, the immediate effects are followed by a late-phase reaction with symptoms occurring about four to six hours later and lasting up to a day.''Allergens, such as ragweed pollen, react with the tissues lining the inner surfaces (membranes) of the nose and eyes, thereby triggering mast cells to release chemical mediators, including histamine. The chemical mediators cause a leakage of fluid and the production of mucous, causing a runny nose, itching, and sneezing. The late reaction also causes the tissues to swell and the nose to become congested.''In the ''lungs'', exposure to inhaled allergens causes ''wheezing'', ''shortness of breath'', and ''coughing'' within seconds or minutes. These symptoms tend to subside after about an hour. However, after about four hours, the late-phase reaction can cause a worsening of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. This phase can last for up to 24 hours. The late-phase reaction involves an influx of a variety of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells) to the affected area, and if repeated inhalations of allergens cause recurrent reactions, these reactions may merge into each other leading to chronic or persistent allergic asthma.''Lastly, allergens can be absorbed into the bloodstream in a systemic reaction and travel to many sites (including the nose, lungs, throat, skin, and digestive tract), causing multiple symptoms that are typical of a ''severe allergic reaction'' (anaphylaxis). Blood vessel dilation may occur throughout the body causing a drop in ''blood pressure'' and ''shock''. Although rare, this type of anaphylactic reaction can be caused by medications, insect venoms, and foods.' "
How does understanding the allergic cascade help?,"'By looking closely at the complex steps involved in this chain of events, scientists have been able to find new and innovative treatments for common and troublesome allergic illnesses.''The most basic, and best, approach to caring for allergies is avoidance of the substances causing them, the allergens. Some allergens such as pet dander, foods, and medications are relatively easy to avoid. However, many other allergens, such as dust mites, molds, and pollens are more difficult to evade. Measures to reduce exposure to them are still essential for the optimal treatment of allergies.''The most convenient approach to the treatment of allergies involves taking various medications, such as ''antihistamines''. The importance of histamine in allergic disease is illustrated by the effectiveness of antihistamines (medically termed H1 receptor blockers) in preventing certain allergic symptoms. They are effective in curtailing itching, sneezing, and runny nose. However, the more severe allergic reactions and ''symptoms of asthma'' require different treatments. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as steroids and leukotriene antagonists, may be required. Medications that widen the airways through the lungs (bronchial dilators) have also been a mainstay in the treatment of asthma and are particularly useful in controlling the immediate or early phase reaction. Current research is aimed at finding medications that target specific steps in the allergic cascade.''The last approach in the management of allergies attempts to interfere with the allergic antibody immune response. ''Allergy shots'' (immunotherapy) aim to desensitize a patient by injecting increasing amounts of the allergens to which the person is allergic. Over time, the immune system becomes less reactive to these allergens, generates less IgE in response to them, and becomes more tolerant upon re-exposure to them.' "
Allergy overview,"'This is a review regarding how the allergic response of the immune system occurs and why certain people become allergic. The most common allergic diseases are described, including ''allergic rhinitis'' (nasal allergies), ''allergic conjunctivitis'' (''eye allergies''), allergic ''asthma'', ''urticaria'' (''hives''), and ''food allergies''.' "
What is an allergy?,"'An allergy is an exaggerated reaction by the immune system in response to exposure to certain foreign substances. The response is exaggerated because these foreign substances are normally seen as harmless by the immune system in nonallergic individuals and do not cause a response in them. In allergic individuals, the body recognizes the substance as foreign, and the allergic part of the immune system generates a response.''Allergy-producing substances are called ""allergens."" Examples of allergens include pollens, dust mites, molds, animal proteins, foods, and medications. When an allergic individual comes in contact with an ''allergen'', the immune system mounts a response through the IgE antibody. People who are prone to allergies are said to be allergic or ""atopic.""'  "
What is an allergy? (Continued)," Approximately 10%-30% of individuals in the industrialized world are affected by allergic conditions, and this number is increasing. Allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies) affects roughly 20% of Americans. Between prescription costs, physician visits, and missed days of work/school, the economic burden of allergic disease exceeds $3 billion annually. Asthma affects roughly 8%-10% of Americans. The estimated health costs for asthma exceed approximately $20 billion annually. Food allergies affect roughly 3%-6% of children in the United States, and about 1%-2% of adults in the U.S. The prevalence of allergic conditions has increased significantly over the last two decades and continues to rise."
What causes allergies?,"'A common scenario can help explain how allergies develop. A few months after the new cat arrives in the house, dad begins to have ''itchy'' eyes and episodes of ''sneezing''. One of the three children develops ''coughing'' and ''wheezing''. The mom and the other two children experience no reaction despite the presence of the cat. How can this occur?'""The immune system is the body's organized defense mechanism against foreign invaders, particularly infections. Its job is to recognize and react to these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.""  "
What causes allergies? (Continued),"'In the pet cat example, the dad and the youngest daughter developed IgE antibodies in large amounts that were targeted against the cat allergen. The dad and daughter are now sensitized, or prone to develop allergic reactions, on repeated exposures to cat allergen. Typically, there is a period of sensitization ranging from days to years prior to an allergic response. Although it might occasionally appear that an allergic reaction has occurred on the first exposure to the allergen, there needs to be prior exposure in order for the immune system to react. It is important to realize that it is impossible to be allergic to something that an individual has truly never been exposed to before, though the first exposure may be subtle or unknown. The first exposure can even occur in a baby in the womb, through ''breast milk'', or through the skin.''IgE is an antibody that all of us have in small amounts. Allergic individuals, however, generally produce IgE in larger quantities. Historically, this antibody was important in protecting us from parasites. In the example above, during a sensitization period, cat dander IgE is overproduced and coats other cells involved in the allergic response, such as mast cells and basophils, which contain various chemical messengers, such as histamine. These cells produce chemical messengers that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction on subsequent exposures to the cat allergen. The cat protein is recognized by the IgE, leading to activation of the cells, which leads to the release of the allergic mediators mentioned above. These chemicals cause typical allergic symptoms, such as localized swelling, inflammation, ''itching'', and ''mucus'' production. Once primed, or sensitized, the immune system is capable of mounting this exaggerated response with subsequent exposures to the allergen.''On exposure to cat dander, whereas the dad and daughter produce IgE, the mom and the other two children produce other classes of antibodies, which do not cause allergic reactions. In these nonallergic members of the family, the cat protein is eliminated uneventfully by the immune system and the cat has no effect on them.''Another part of the immune system, the T-cell, may be involved in allergic responses in the skin, as occurs from the oils of plants, such as ''poison ivy'', ''poison oak'', ''poison sumac'', reactions to metal, such as nickel, or certain chemicals. The T-cell may recognize a certain allergen in a substance contacting the skin and cause an inflammatory response. This inflammatory response can cause an ''itchy'' ''rash''.' "
Who is at risk for allergies and why?,"'Allergies can develop at any age, but most food allergies begin at a young age, and many are outgrown. Environmental allergies can develop at any time. The initial exposure or sensitization period may even begin before birth. Individuals can also outgrow allergies over time. It is not fully understood why one person develops allergies and another does not, but there are several risk factors for allergic conditions. Family history, or genetics, plays a large role, with a higher risk for allergies if parents or siblings have allergies. There are numerous other risk factors for developing allergic conditions. Children born via Cesarean section have a higher risk of allergy as compared to children who are delivered vaginally. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution increases the risk of allergy. Boys are more likely to be allergic than girls. Allergies are more common in westernized countries, and less common in those with a farming lifestyle. Timing of exposures to antigens, use of antibiotics, and numerous other factors, some of which are not yet known, also contribute to the development of allergies. This complicated process continues to be an area of medical research.' "
"What are common types of allergic conditions, and what are allergy symptoms and signs?","'The parts of the body that are prone to allergic symptoms include the eyes, nose, ''lungs'', skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although the various allergic diseases may appear different, they all result from an exaggerated immune response to foreign substances in sensitive individuals. The following are brief descriptions of common allergic disorders.'  "
Allergic rhinitis (hay fever),"'Allergic rhinitis (""''hay fever''"") is the most common of the allergic diseases and refers to nasal symptoms that are due to aeroallergens. Year-round, or perennial, allergic rhinitis is usually caused by ''indoor allergens'', such as dust mites, animal dander, or molds. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is typically caused by tree, grass, or weed pollens. Many individuals have a combination of both seasonal and perennial allergies. Symptoms result from the inflammation of the tissues that line the inside of the nose after exposure to allergens. The ears, sinuses, and throat can also be involved. The most common symptoms include the following:''In 1819, an English physician, John Bostock, first described hay ''fever'' by detailing his own seasonal nasal symptoms, which he called ""summer catarrh."" The condition was called hay ''fever'' because it was thought to be caused by ""new hay.""' Runny nose Stuffy nose Sneezing Itchy nose, ears, and throat Postnasal drip (throat clearing)"
Asthma,"'Asthma is a respiratory condition that results from inflammation and hyperreactivity of the airways, leading to recurrent, reversible narrowing of the airways. Asthma can often coexist with allergic rhinitis. Other common triggers include respiratory viral infections and ''exercise''. Common symptoms include the following:'   Shortness of breath Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness"
Allergic eyes (conjunctivitis),"'Allergic eyes (''conjunctivitis'') are inflammation of the tissue layers (membranes) that cover the surface of the eyeball and the undersurface of the ''eyelid''. The inflammation occurs as a result of an allergic reaction and may produce the following symptoms, which are generally present in both eyes:' Redness under the lids and of the eye overall Watery, itchy eyes Swelling of the membranes"
Eczema (atopic dermatitis),"'Eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') is a condition commonly found in infants. It tends to occur in individuals at risk for other allergic conditions (asthma and allergic rhinitis) but is not usually caused by direct allergen exposure. The ''rash'' results from a complicated inflammatory process. Common features include the following:' Dry skin associated with significant itching Involvement of the face, the front of elbows, and behind knees, though the rash can occur anywhere"
Hives (urticaria),"'Hives (''urticaria'') are skin reactions that appear as red, raised, itchy welts and can occur on any part of the body. Short-lived (acute) hives are often due to an allergic reaction to a food or medication, though they also commonly result from a viral infection in children. They can also result from contact (such as licking) from cats or ''dogs''. Hives that recur over a longer period (chronic hives) are rarely due to an allergic reaction. Hives are characterized by' raised, red, welts that resolve over hours to a day; intense itching (typically not painful); no residual marks or bruising upon resolution; and swelling (particularly of the lips, face, hands, and feet)."
Anaphylaxis,"'Anaphylactic shock'' is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can affect a number of organs at the same time. Allergens that typically lead to ''anaphylaxis'' are foods, medications, and venom (bee stings). Environmental allergens rarely lead to anaphylaxis, except anaphylaxis can result from ''allergy shots'' (subcutaneous immunotherapy). Some or all of the following symptoms may occur:''Anaphylactic shock is an emergent, life-threatening condition that occurs when blood vessels dilate excessively due to an allergic reaction, which causes a significant drop in ''blood pressure''. This can result in inadequate blood flow to the organs in the body.'   Hives itching or flushing present in 80%-90% of cases Nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes Swelling of the tongue and/or throat Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing Low blood pressure, leading to lightheadedness, passing out, or shock"
Where are allergens?,"'Allergens may be inhaled, ingested (eaten or swallowed), applied to the skin, or injected into the body either as a medication or inadvertently by an ''insect sting''. The symptoms and conditions that result depend largely on the route of entry and the type of allergen. The chemical structure of allergens affects the route of exposure. Airborne pollens, for example, tend to have little effect on the skin. They are easily inhaled and will thus cause more nasal and respiratory symptoms with limited skin symptoms. When allergens are swallowed or injected, they may travel to other parts of the body and provoke symptoms that are remote from their point of entry. For example, allergens in foods may prompt the release of mediators in the skin and cause hives.'""The specific protein structure is what determines the allergen's characteristics. Cat protein, Fel d 1, from the ""'Felis domesticus'' (the domesticated cat), is the predominant cat allergen. Each allergen has a unique protein structure leading to its allergic characteristics.' "
In the air we breathe,"'Aside from oxygen, the air contains a wide variety of particles, including allergens. The usual diseases that result from airborne allergens are hay fever, asthma, and ''conjunctivitis''. The following allergens can trigger allergic reactions when inhaled by sensitized individuals.' Pollens from trees, grasses, and/or weeds Dust mites Animal proteins, including dander, skin, and/or urine Mold spores Insect parts, especially from cockroaches"
In what we ingest,"'Foods and medications can also cause allergic reactions, some of which can be severe. These reactions often start with localized tingling or itching and then may lead to rash or additional symptoms, such as swelling, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or difficulty ''breathing''. Here are the two most common allergens that are ingested:' Foods: The most common food allergens are cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, shellfish, finned fish, and sesame. Cow's milk, egg, wheat, and soy allergies are most common in children and are often outgrown over time. The most common allergens in adults are peanut, tree nuts, and shellfish. It should be noted that gluten is not a common food allergy, and true gluten hypersensitivity, or celiac disease, is mediated by another type of antibody (not IgE but IgA) and also leads to a different symptoms (including chronic abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, change in stool, and anemia). Medications: Although any medication can cause an allergic reaction, common examples include antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Notably, many individuals who think they are allergic to medications actually can tolerate the medication without difficulty."
Touching our skin,"'Contact dermatitis'' is an inflammation of the skin that is caused by local exposure to a substance. The majority of these localized skin reactions do not involve IgE but are caused by other inflammatory cells. A good example is ''poison ivy''. Examples of substances that commonly cause contact ''dermatitis'' include the following:' Plants (poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak) Latex Personal care product ingredients Nickel and other metals Cosmetics"
Injected into our bodies,"'The most severe reactions often occur when allergens are injected into the body and gain direct access to the bloodstream. This intravenous access carries the increased risk of a systemic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. The following are commonly injected allergens that can cause severe allergic reactions:' Insect venom Medications Allergy shots"
What specialists treat people with allergies?,"'Although primary care physicians are able to treat mild allergic symptoms, allergy/immunology physicians (allergists) treat individuals with more significant allergies. Many allergists treat both children and adults, but some are specialized to either patient group alone.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose allergies? What are the types of allergy testing?,"'The diagnosis of allergies begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Many people with allergies have other family members with allergic conditions. In addition to the history and exam, skin testing and sometimes blood work (specific IgE levels) can help with the diagnosis of allergies. There are several important considerations when interpreting the results of this testing:' For environmental allergies such as pets, dust mites, pollen, and molds, skin prick testing is the best test to help with diagnosis of allergy. Blood work looking for the allergic antibody (IgE) is less sensitive and may miss some allergies. For food allergy testing, the most important part of the diagnosis is the health history. Skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) should only be ordered if the history is suggestive of food allergy. Without a suggestive history, food allergy skin testing and blood work is not very specific and has a high rate of false positive results. For food allergy testing, ordering skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) for broad panels of foods is discouraged, given the high rate of false positive results. For drug allergy, the history is the most important element in diagnosis. The only antibiotic with validated skin testing is penicillin. Penicillin skin testing can be very helpful in determining if an individual is truly allergic to penicillin and related antibiotics. Blood work (specific IgE testing) is not particularly helpful for the diagnosis of drug allergies. Sometimes, such as with food allergy and drug allergy, despite a detailed history and appropriate testing, the diagnosis of allergy remains unclear. In these situations, it is appropriate to consider a “graded challenge,” which is the “gold standard,” or the best test, for the diagnosis of allergies. A graded challenge should always be performed with an allergist in a setting equipped to manage a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis."
What are treatment options and medicines for allergies?,"'The treatment for allergies depends on the particular condition. Some general guidelines are as follows:''Allergic rhinitis and ''conjunctivitis''Asthma''Eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'')''Hives (urticaria)''Anaphylaxis''Allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots)' Environmental control measures: These have limited efficacy.For dust mites, it helps to decrease humidity in the home and wash bedding in hot water once weekly.For pets, avoidance is most effective. Cat allergen is airborne, so having a cat in the home will cause allergic symptoms. Keeping dogs out of the bedroom may help reduce symptoms. Bathing both cats and dogs may decrease the allergen burden somewhat. There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, but hypoallergenic cats have been bred. For pollen, keeping windows closed and staying indoors on high pollen days may be helpful. For dust mites, it helps to decrease humidity in the home and wash bedding in hot water once weekly. For pets, avoidance is most effective. Cat allergen is airborne, so having a cat in the home will cause allergic symptoms. Keeping dogs out of the bedroom may help reduce symptoms.

For pollen, keeping windows closed and staying indoors on high pollen days may be helpful. Oral antihistamines Nasal antihistamines Antihistamine eyedrops Nasal corticosteroids Allergen immunotherapy (see below) Rescue inhalers Inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting bronchodilator combinations, long-acting anti-muscarinic medications Oral maintenance medications (anti-leukotriene medications, theophylline) Injectable medications, called ""biologics"" that must be administered at a medical facility or sometimes at home Allergen immunotherapy (see below) Oral steroids Routine moisturization Topical corticosteroids Oral antihistamines to help control itching Immunosuppressive medications in severe cases An injectable biologic medication, dupilumab (Dupixent) Oral antihistamines Oral steroids Injectable medications (biologic) administered in a medical facility Immunosupressive medications in severe cases Epinephrine is the one and only treatment for anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can involve multiple body systems and is life threatening. Epinephrine is administered in a medical facility or outside of a medical facility with an auto-injector into the muscle in the lateral thigh. Up to 20%-30% of severe allergic reactions may require treatment with more than one dose of epinephrine, so individuals who carry epinephrine should ideally carry two auto-injectors. If an individual experiences anaphylaxis and uses epinephrine, they should call 911 to be appropriately monitored. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are not appropriate treatments of anaphylaxis. Allergy shots have been shown to decrease symptoms of environmental allergies and asthma and may also be beneficial in eczema. Allergy shots should be prescribed by an allergist and should always be administered in a health care facility equipped to manage a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Allergy shots help make the body less sensitive to the culprit allergen, such as pets, dust mites, pollens, and molds. Recently, the FDA has also approved immunotherapy that can be administered with a tablet under the tongue (sublingual immunotherapy). To date, this is only available for grass, ragweed, and dust mite. Unlike allergy shots, sublingual immunotherapy can be administered at home because the risk of a severe allergic reaction is lower with sublingual therapy. Of note, although there is significant research being done in the area, immunotherapy not FDA-approved to treat food allergies. The treatment of food allergy remains avoidance of the culprit food and management of accidental exposures with the appropriate medications."
Are there home remedies for allergies?,"'Although there is significant research examining the role of ''vitamins'', herbal medications, and other therapies on the treatment of allergies, there are currently no proven home remedies that successfully treat allergies.' "
What is the prognosis of allergies?,"'People with allergies have an excellent prognosis. Many children outgrow allergies over time, particularly food and medication allergies, such as penicillin. On the other hand, allergies can develop at any age. Allergies should not affect life expectancy, and with proper management, the majority of individuals with allergies should maintain an acceptable quality of life.' "
Is it possible to prevent allergies?,"'With the increasing prevalence of allergic conditions, many studies have examined risk factors for allergies and how to modify these to potentially prevent allergies. The development of allergies results from a complex interplay between a person’s genetic make-up (genotype) and its interaction with the environment (phenotype). Having family members with allergic conditions increases the risk of allergy. Numerous environmental influences may also affect the development of allergy, such as ''breastfeeding'', cesarean sections, ''diet'' during ''pregnancy'', ''vitamin D'' levels, use of antibiotics, use of ''probiotics'', animal exposures, bacterial exposures, pollutant exposure, and ''diet'' during infancy. Of all the factors studied to date, it appears that introducing highly allergic foods into the child’s diet before one year of age may decrease the risk of food allergy, particularly ''peanut allergy''. Allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) have also been shown to decrease the risk of developing future environmental allergies and asthma. Finding additional ways to prevent allergic conditions remains an active area of research.' "

Its job is to recognize and react to these foreign substances, which are called antigens. Antigens often lead to an immune response through the production of antibodies, which are protective proteins that are specifically targeted against particular antigens. These antibodies, or immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA), are protective and help destroy a foreign particle by attaching to its surface, thereby making it easier for other immune cells to destroy it. The allergic person however, develops a specific type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, in response to certain normally harmless foreign substances, such as cat dander, pollen, or foods. Other antigens, such as bacteria, do not lead to production of IgE, and therefore do not cause allergic reactions. Once IgE is formed, it can recognize the antigen and can then trigger an allergic response. IgE was discovered and named in 1967 by Kimishige and Teriko Ishizaka.""  "
What causes allergies? (Continued),"'In the pet cat example, the dad and the youngest daughter developed IgE antibodies in large amounts that were targeted against the cat allergen. The dad and daughter are now sensitized, or prone to develop allergic reactions, on repeated exposures to cat allergen. Typically, there is a period of sensitization ranging from days to years prior to an allergic response. Although it might occasionally appear that an allergic reaction has occurred on the first exposure to the allergen, there needs to be prior exposure in order for the immune system to react. It is important to realize that it is impossible to be allergic to something that an individual has truly never been exposed to before, though the first exposure may be subtle or unknown. The first exposure can even occur in a baby in the womb, through ''breast milk'', or through the skin.''IgE is an antibody that all of us have in small amounts. Allergic individuals, however, generally produce IgE in larger quantities. Historically, this antibody was important in protecting us from parasites. In the example above, during a sensitization period, cat dander IgE is overproduced and coats other cells involved in the allergic response, such as mast cells and basophils, which contain various chemical messengers, such as histamine. These cells produce chemical messengers that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction on subsequent exposures to the cat allergen. The cat protein is recognized by the IgE, leading to activation of the cells, which leads to the release of the allergic mediators mentioned above. These chemicals cause typical allergic symptoms, such as localized swelling, inflammation, ''itching'', and ''mucus'' production. Once primed, or sensitized, the immune system is capable of mounting this exaggerated response with subsequent exposures to the allergen.''On exposure to cat dander, whereas the dad and daughter produce IgE, the mom and the other two children produce other classes of antibodies, which do not cause allergic reactions. In these nonallergic members of the family, the cat protein is eliminated uneventfully by the immune system and the cat has no effect on them.''Another part of the immune system, the T-cell, may be involved in allergic responses in the skin, as occurs from the oils of plants, such as ''poison ivy'', ''poison oak'', ''poison sumac'', reactions to metal, such as nickel, or certain chemicals. The T-cell may recognize a certain allergen in a substance contacting the skin and cause an inflammatory response. This inflammatory response can cause an ''itchy'' ''rash''.' "
Who is at risk for allergies and why?,"'Allergies can develop at any age, but most food allergies begin at a young age, and many are outgrown. Environmental allergies can develop at any time. The initial exposure or sensitization period may even begin before birth. Individuals can also outgrow allergies over time. It is not fully understood why one person develops allergies and another does not, but there are several risk factors for allergic conditions. Family history, or genetics, plays a large role, with a higher risk for allergies if parents or siblings have allergies. There are numerous other risk factors for developing allergic conditions. Children born via Cesarean section have a higher risk of allergy as compared to children who are delivered vaginally. Exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution increases the risk of allergy. Boys are more likely to be allergic than girls. Allergies are more common in westernized countries, and less common in those with a farming lifestyle. Timing of exposures to antigens, use of antibiotics, and numerous other factors, some of which are not yet known, also contribute to the development of allergies. This complicated process continues to be an area of medical research.' "
"What are common types of allergic conditions, and what are allergy symptoms and signs?","'The parts of the body that are prone to allergic symptoms include the eyes, nose, ''lungs'', skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although the various allergic diseases may appear different, they all result from an exaggerated immune response to foreign substances in sensitive individuals. The following are brief descriptions of common allergic disorders.'  "
Allergic rhinitis (hay fever),"'Allergic rhinitis (""''hay fever''"") is the most common of the allergic diseases and refers to nasal symptoms that are due to aeroallergens. Year-round, or perennial, allergic rhinitis is usually caused by ''indoor allergens'', such as dust mites, animal dander, or molds. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is typically caused by tree, grass, or weed pollens. Many individuals have a combination of both seasonal and perennial allergies. Symptoms result from the inflammation of the tissues that line the inside of the nose after exposure to allergens. The ears, sinuses, and throat can also be involved. The most common symptoms include the following:''In 1819, an English physician, John Bostock, first described hay ''fever'' by detailing his own seasonal nasal symptoms, which he called ""summer catarrh."" The condition was called hay ''fever'' because it was thought to be caused by ""new hay.""' Runny nose Stuffy nose Sneezing Itchy nose, ears, and throat Postnasal drip (throat clearing)"
Asthma,"'Asthma is a respiratory condition that results from inflammation and hyperreactivity of the airways, leading to recurrent, reversible narrowing of the airways. Asthma can often coexist with allergic rhinitis. Other common triggers include respiratory viral infections and ''exercise''. Common symptoms include the following:'   Shortness of breath Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness"
Allergic eyes (conjunctivitis),"'Allergic eyes (''conjunctivitis'') are inflammation of the tissue layers (membranes) that cover the surface of the eyeball and the undersurface of the ''eyelid''. The inflammation occurs as a result of an allergic reaction and may produce the following symptoms, which are generally present in both eyes:' Redness under the lids and of the eye overall Watery, itchy eyes Swelling of the membranes"
Eczema (atopic dermatitis),"'Eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') is a condition commonly found in infants. It tends to occur in individuals at risk for other allergic conditions (asthma and allergic rhinitis) but is not usually caused by direct allergen exposure. The ''rash'' results from a complicated inflammatory process. Common features include the following:' Dry skin associated with significant itching Involvement of the face, the front of elbows, and behind knees, though the rash can occur anywhere"
Hives (urticaria),"'Hives (''urticaria'') are skin reactions that appear as red, raised, itchy welts and can occur on any part of the body. Short-lived (acute) hives are often due to an allergic reaction to a food or medication, though they also commonly result from a viral infection in children. They can also result from contact (such as licking) from cats or ''dogs''. Hives that recur over a longer period (chronic hives) are rarely due to an allergic reaction. Hives are characterized by' raised, red, welts that resolve over hours to a day; intense itching (typically not painful); no residual marks or bruising upon resolution; and swelling (particularly of the lips, face, hands, and feet)."
Anaphylaxis,"'Anaphylactic shock'' is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can affect a number of organs at the same time. Allergens that typically lead to ''anaphylaxis'' are foods, medications, and venom (bee stings). Environmental allergens rarely lead to anaphylaxis, except anaphylaxis can result from ''allergy shots'' (subcutaneous immunotherapy). Some or all of the following symptoms may occur:''Anaphylactic shock is an emergent, life-threatening condition that occurs when blood vessels dilate excessively due to an allergic reaction, which causes a significant drop in ''blood pressure''. This can result in inadequate blood flow to the organs in the body.'   Hives itching or flushing present in 80%-90% of cases Nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy eyes Swelling of the tongue and/or throat Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing Low blood pressure, leading to lightheadedness, passing out, or shock"
Where are allergens?,"'Allergens may be inhaled, ingested (eaten or swallowed), applied to the skin, or injected into the body either as a medication or inadvertently by an ''insect sting''. The symptoms and conditions that result depend largely on the route of entry and the type of allergen. The chemical structure of allergens affects the route of exposure. Airborne pollens, for example, tend to have little effect on the skin. They are easily inhaled and will thus cause more nasal and respiratory symptoms with limited skin symptoms. When allergens are swallowed or injected, they may travel to other parts of the body and provoke symptoms that are remote from their point of entry. For example, allergens in foods may prompt the release of mediators in the skin and cause hives.'""The specific protein structure is what determines the allergen's characteristics. Cat protein, Fel d 1, from the ""'Felis domesticus'' (the domesticated cat), is the predominant cat allergen. Each allergen has a unique protein structure leading to its allergic characteristics.' "
In the air we breathe,"'Aside from oxygen, the air contains a wide variety of particles, including allergens. The usual diseases that result from airborne allergens are hay fever, asthma, and ''conjunctivitis''. The following allergens can trigger allergic reactions when inhaled by sensitized individuals.' Pollens from trees, grasses, and/or weeds Dust mites Animal proteins, including dander, skin, and/or urine Mold spores Insect parts, especially from cockroaches"
In what we ingest,"'Foods and medications can also cause allergic reactions, some of which can be severe. These reactions often start with localized tingling or itching and then may lead to rash or additional symptoms, such as swelling, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or difficulty ''breathing''. Here are the two most common allergens that are ingested:' Foods: The most common food allergens are cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, shellfish, finned fish, and sesame. Cow's milk, egg, wheat, and soy allergies are most common in children and are often outgrown over time. The most common allergens in adults are peanut, tree nuts, and shellfish. It should be noted that gluten is not a common food allergy, and true gluten hypersensitivity, or celiac disease, is mediated by another type of antibody (not IgE but IgA) and also leads to a different symptoms (including chronic abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, change in stool, and anemia). Medications: Although any medication can cause an allergic reaction, common examples include antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Notably, many individuals who think they are allergic to medications actually can tolerate the medication without difficulty."
Touching our skin,"'Contact dermatitis'' is an inflammation of the skin that is caused by local exposure to a substance. The majority of these localized skin reactions do not involve IgE but are caused by other inflammatory cells. A good example is ''poison ivy''. Examples of substances that commonly cause contact ''dermatitis'' include the following:' Plants (poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak) Latex Personal care product ingredients Nickel and other metals Cosmetics"
Injected into our bodies,"'The most severe reactions often occur when allergens are injected into the body and gain direct access to the bloodstream. This intravenous access carries the increased risk of a systemic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. The following are commonly injected allergens that can cause severe allergic reactions:' Insect venom Medications Allergy shots"
What specialists treat people with allergies?,"'Although primary care physicians are able to treat mild allergic symptoms, allergy/immunology physicians (allergists) treat individuals with more significant allergies. Many allergists treat both children and adults, but some are specialized to either patient group alone.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose allergies? What are the types of allergy testing?,"'The diagnosis of allergies begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Many people with allergies have other family members with allergic conditions. In addition to the history and exam, skin testing and sometimes blood work (specific IgE levels) can help with the diagnosis of allergies. There are several important considerations when interpreting the results of this testing:' For environmental allergies such as pets, dust mites, pollen, and molds, skin prick testing is the best test to help with diagnosis of allergy. Blood work looking for the allergic antibody (IgE) is less sensitive and may miss some allergies. For food allergy testing, the most important part of the diagnosis is the health history. Skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) should only be ordered if the history is suggestive of food allergy. Without a suggestive history, food allergy skin testing and blood work is not very specific and has a high rate of false positive results. For food allergy testing, ordering skin testing or blood work (specific IgE testing) for broad panels of foods is discouraged, given the high rate of false positive results. For drug allergy, the history is the most important element in diagnosis. The only antibiotic with validated skin testing is penicillin. Penicillin skin testing can be very helpful in determining if an individual is truly allergic to penicillin and related antibiotics. Blood work (specific IgE testing) is not particularly helpful for the diagnosis of drug allergies. Sometimes, such as with food allergy and drug allergy, despite a detailed history and appropriate testing, the diagnosis of allergy remains unclear. In these situations, it is appropriate to consider a “graded challenge,” which is the “gold standard,” or the best test, for the diagnosis of allergies. A graded challenge should always be performed with an allergist in a setting equipped to manage a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis."
What are treatment options and medicines for allergies?,"'The treatment for allergies depends on the particular condition. Some general guidelines are as follows:''Allergic rhinitis and ''conjunctivitis''Asthma''Eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'')''Hives (urticaria)''Anaphylaxis''Allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots)' Environmental control measures: These have limited efficacy.For dust mites, it helps to decrease humidity in the home and wash bedding in hot water once weekly.For pets, avoidance is most effective. Cat allergen is airborne, so having a cat in the home will cause allergic symptoms. Keeping dogs out of the bedroom may help reduce symptoms. Bathing both cats and dogs may decrease the allergen burden somewhat. There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, but hypoallergenic cats have been bred. For pollen, keeping windows closed and staying indoors on high pollen days may be helpful. For dust mites, it helps to decrease humidity in the home and wash bedding in hot water once weekly. For pets, avoidance is most effective. Cat allergen is airborne, so having a cat in the home will cause allergic symptoms. Keeping dogs out of the bedroom may help reduce symptoms. Bathing both cats and dogs may decrease the allergen burden somewhat. There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, but hypoallergenic cats have been bred. For pollen, keeping windows closed and staying indoors on high pollen days may be helpful. Oral antihistamines Nasal antihistamines Antihistamine eyedrops Nasal corticosteroids Allergen immunotherapy (see below) Rescue inhalers Inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting bronchodilator combinations, long-acting anti-muscarinic medications Oral maintenance medications (anti-leukotriene medications, theophylline) Injectable medications, called ""biologics"" that must be administered at a medical facility or sometimes at home Allergen immunotherapy (see below) Oral steroids Routine moisturization Topical corticosteroids Oral antihistamines to help control itching Immunosuppressive medications in severe cases An injectable biologic medication, dupilumab (Dupixent) Oral antihistamines Oral steroids Injectable medications (biologic) administered in a medical facility Immunosupressive medications in severe cases Epinephrine is the one and only treatment for anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction that can involve multiple body systems and is life threatening. Epinephrine is administered in a medical facility or outside of a medical facility with an auto-injector into the muscle in the lateral thigh. Up to 20%-30% of severe allergic reactions may require treatment with more than one dose of epinephrine, so individuals who carry epinephrine should ideally carry two auto-injectors. If an individual experiences anaphylaxis and uses epinephrine, they should call 911 to be appropriately monitored. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are not appropriate treatments of anaphylaxis. Allergy shots have been shown to decrease symptoms of environmental allergies and asthma and may also be beneficial in eczema. Allergy shots should be prescribed by an allergist and should always be administered in a health care facility equipped to manage a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Allergy shots help make the body less sensitive to the culprit allergen, such as pets, dust mites, pollens, and molds. Recently, the FDA has also approved immunotherapy that can be administered with a tablet under the tongue (sublingual immunotherapy). To date, this is only available for grass, ragweed, and dust mite. Unlike allergy shots, sublingual immunotherapy can be administered at home because the risk of a severe allergic reaction is lower with sublingual therapy. Of note, although there is significant research being done in the area, immunotherapy not FDA-approved to treat food allergies. The treatment of food allergy remains avoidance of the culprit food and management of accidental exposures with the appropriate medications."
Are there home remedies for allergies?,"'Although there is significant research examining the role of ''vitamins'', herbal medications, and other therapies on the treatment of allergies, there are currently no proven home remedies that successfully treat allergies.' "
What is the prognosis of allergies?,"'People with allergies have an excellent prognosis. Many children outgrow allergies over time, particularly food and medication allergies, such as penicillin. On the other hand, allergies can develop at any age. Allergies should not affect life expectancy, and with proper management, the majority of individuals with allergies should maintain an acceptable quality of life.' "
Is it possible to prevent allergies?,"'With the increasing prevalence of allergic conditions, many studies have examined risk factors for allergies and how to modify these to potentially prevent allergies. The development of allergies results from a complex interplay between a person’s genetic make-up (genotype) and its interaction with the environment (phenotype). Having family members with allergic conditions increases the risk of allergy. Numerous environmental influences may also affect the development of allergy, such as ''breastfeeding'', cesarean sections, ''diet'' during ''pregnancy'', ''vitamin D'' levels, use of antibiotics, use of ''probiotics'', animal exposures, bacterial exposures, pollutant exposure, and ''diet'' during infancy. Of all the factors studied to date, it appears that introducing highly allergic foods into the child’s diet before one year of age may decrease the risk of food allergy, particularly ''peanut allergy''. Allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) have also been shown to decrease the risk of developing future environmental allergies and asthma. Finding additional ways to prevent allergic conditions remains an active area of research.' "
Facts you should know about a diaper rash,"  Diaper rash is very common in babies and is not a sign of parental neglect. Diaper rash is most commonly a kind of contact dermatitis. Diaper rash may become secondarily infected by bacteria or yeast normally present on the skin. In this case, topical antibiotic ointments provide a rapid and effective therapy. Avoidance of skin irritants by frequent diaper changing provides the number-one preventative measure. Effective treatments include frequent diaper changes, application of topical barriers (for example, petroleum jelly), and rarely topical antibiotic/antifungal ointments, or low-potency hydrocortisone cream. High-potency steroid creams, powders, and concentrated baking-soda/boric-acid baths and neomycin-containing ointments are to be avoided."
What is diaper rash?,"'Diaper rash is a generalized term indicating any skin irritation (regardless of cause) that develops in the diaper-covered region. Synonyms include diaper ''dermatitis'' (dermatitis = inflammation of the skin), napkin (or ""nappy"") dermatitis, and ammonia dermatitis. While there are several broad categories of causes of diaper rash, contact irritation is the most common culprit. While diaper rash is generally thought to affect infants and toddlers, any individual wearing a diaper (for example, an ''incontinent'' adult) is a candidate to develop this dermatitis.' "
Is diaper rash a sign of neglectful care?,"'No, not at all. Parents often incorrectly feel that the rash is a visual representation of poor caretaking skills. However, parents need to understand that the basic causes for this common kind of skin irritation are still under active debate in the field of dermatology and that neglectful ''parenting'' is not among the possible factors. In the United States, diaper dermatitis represents about 10%-20% of all skin disorders managed by a general pediatrician. While the rash may develop as early as the first week of life, the most frequent time period is between 9-12 months of age. Studies have indicated that, at any point in time, between 7%-35% of children in this age range are experiencing such a skin rash.' "
What causes diaper rash?,"'There are several categories of causes for this dermatitis. First and foremost is ""irritant"" or ""contact"" dermatitis. Skin involvement may vary from mild redness (similar in character to a ''sunburn'') to erosion of the top layers of skin. A characteristic differential point of contract diaper dermatitis from other causes of diaper rash is that it rarely involves the skin fold ''regions -- therefore,'' it spares areas not in contact with urine/''stool''.''Skin infections compose the next most common category of diaper rash. Bacteria (''staph'' and ''strep'') and yeast/fungal (''Candida'') are common causes of diaper rash. Generally, both of these types of infections tend to result from a disruption of skin integrity and overwhelming the natural defense mechanisms of skin in this diaper region. Staph and ''strep'' ''bacterial infections'' are commonly termed ''impetigo''. Classic descriptions of ''impetigo'' include small (1-2 mm) tiny ''blisters'' (vesicles) and pustules that tend to easily rupture leaving multiple erosions in a sea of generalized skin irritation. ''Candida'' diaper dermatitis also has several distinguishing patterns. The rash is characterized by zones of bright red skin with a series of discrete 2-4 mm ""satellite"" lesions at the borders of the confluent irritated skin. In contrast to contact dermatitis, ''Candida'"" is generally only found in the skin folds' creases and often around the anal region. Infectious causes of diaper dermatitis can generally be diagnosed by visual inspection alone. If ""'confusion'' exists, laboratory studies of swabs of the involved areas may be obtained.''Allergic'' reactions are a less common cause of diaper rash. Commonly proposed allergens are fragrances and components of the diaper and wipes. These regions often have well-defined zones of redness with superficial vesicles and erosions. If the diagnosis of allergic skin reaction is suspect, skin-patch testing may be done to identify the offending agent. This is rarely necessary.''In addition to the common place causes of diaper rash, there are also a few very unusual causes of this problem. Unusual infections, metabolic and nutritional deficiency states, and immunodeficiency states and malignancies can all be implicated. Unfortunately, ''child abuse'' (hot-water immersion, extreme neglect to infant hygiene) can also feature a diaper rash.' "
What are diaper rash symptoms and signs?,"""A diaper rash is a change in the skin enclosed by a child's diaper. Most commonly, the involved skin is red and may or may not have erosion of the superficial skin layers. Pustules or small blisters may be present. If the irritated skin is sensitive, diaper changing may be mildly uncomfortable to the child."" "
How do doctors diagnose the cause of a diaper rash?,"'Most diaper ''rashes'' are a result of skin irritants (urine and/or ''stool'') inflaming immature, vulnerable skin. Such a rash is termed a contact skin irritant rash. Two types of infections may occur independently or be a complication of a contact diaper rash. Staph and strep bacterial skin infections may be associated with pustules or tiny blisters. A ''Candida'' ''yeast infection'' may also develop in the diaper region and around the anal area.' "
What treatments are recommended for diaper rash?,"'The best treatment for diaper rash is avoidance of the precipitating agents which led to the contact irritation and to regions becoming secondarily infected by skin bacteria or yeast. Frequent diaper changes limit stool and urine exposure to the area and remain the foundation for ''prevention'' and management of diaper dermatitis.''Should a rash develop, simple cleansing with water and soft cloths tends to be less irritating to the injured skin than disposable wipes. Frequent application of one of the many diaper-area ointments containing either petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or zinc oxide (''Desitin'') provides an effective barrier against skin irritants and lessens friction to irritated skin. If the diaper rash is especially irritated by the rubbing necessary for proper hygiene, then using a non-sticky cream or ointment (such as Vaseline) as a barrier may be an important consideration. If sticky stool hinders hygiene, it may be more easily removed after application of mineral oil to the area. Most pediatricians find no benefit to using cornstarch or talcum power. The risk of possible aspiration of these powders underscores their general lack of significant efficacy. High-concentration baking soda or boric-acid baths are to be avoided due to possibility of toxicity associated with an increased rate of absorption due to skin breakdown.''Weather and/or carpet permitting, open-air exposure of the irritated skin is also extremely effective in helping clear up diaper rash. Many children have a therapeutic response to merely sitting in a warm-water bath twice daily for 15-20 minutes per session. The value of additional agents (including baking soda) added to the bath water is debatable.''Should these measures not provide a solid response within two to three days, the possibility of a secondary bacterial or ''yeast infection'' must be considered. The diaper region should be examined by a pediatrician unless the parent is confident in correctly making these diagnoses. Several topical antibiotic ointments are available for therapy in these situations.' "
Are there home remedies for a diaper rash?,"'Home remedies for diaper rash include'  air exposure (such as no diaper for short time periods), extra bathing (10-15 minutes in warm water), application of topical barriers to the diaper region. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and zinc oxide (Desitin) are often helpful. Powders are not recommended. Neither are high concentrations of baking soda or boric acid baths."
How about not using disposable diapers?,"""Parents often wonder if switching from disposable to cloth diapers will lessen the likelihood of contact type diaper rash. In fact, the opposite seems to be true. The absorbent gel material found in most of today's disposable diapers draws moisture away from the skin area, thus helping to promote a healthy diaper area."" "
How should an allergic rash be treated?,"'For an ''allergic reaction'' to the fragrances or other components found in disposable diapers or wipes, eliminating the offending agents by using either simple water cleansing of the skin and a switch to another brand of disposable diapers or using cloth diapers instead is usually therapeutic.' "
How about using cortisone cream?,"'A minimally concentrated hydrocortisone cream may be recommended in certain cases. However, the excessive usage of minimally concentrated hydrocortisone cream and the use of increased potency hydrocortisone preparations are notorious for causing secondary side effects. They should only be used under the guidance of a pediatrician or another physician who is fully familiar with their application to infants.' "
How about using Neosporin?,"'This ointment (and others containing the topical antibiotic neomycin) should be avoided since neomycin is a very common ''allergen'' promoting an allergic skin reaction. Instead of helping the situation, such a medication may complicate and confuse the situation.' "
What is the prognosis for a diaper rash?,"'The prognosis for diaper ''rashes'' is excellent. The routine therapies above should provide a rapid and effective response. Lack of such an improvement should raise a red flag to have a pediatric evaluation to rule out unusual conditions associated with a diaper rash. Unfortunately, diaper rashes may recur.' "
Is it possible to prevent a diaper rash?,"'Several approaches can help prevent a diaper rash. These include timely changing of soiled diapers, experimentation with alternative diaper brands to address the possibility of a unique sensitivity reaction, air exposure, and extra bathing. It is very important for parents to appreciate that development of a diaper rash is not an indictment of their parenting skills. Rather, it is one of the many challenges of parenthood.' "
What is atopic dermatitis?,"""Atopic dermatitis is a common, often persistent skin disease that affects a large percentage of the world's population. Atopy is a special type of ""'allergic'' hypersensitivity that is associated with ''asthma'', ''inhalant'' ''allergies'' (''hay fever''), and a chronic dermatitis. There is a known hereditary component of the disease, and it is more common in affected families. Criteria that enable a doctor to diagnose it include the typical appearance and distribution of the ''rash'' in a patient with a personal or family history of ''asthma'' and/or hay ''fever''. The term ''atopic'' is from the Greek meaning ""strange."" The term ''dermatitis'' means inflammation of the skin. Many physicians and patients use the term ''eczema'' when they are referring to this condition. Sometimes it is called neurodermatitis.''In atopic dermatitis, the skin becomes extremely ''itchy'' and inflamed, causing redness, swelling, vesicle formation (minute ''blisters''), cracking, weeping, crusting, and scaling. This type of eruption is termed eczematous. In addition, ''dry skin'' is a very common complaint in almost all those afflicted with atopic dermatitis.''Although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age, most often it affects infants and young children. Occasionally, it may persist into adulthood or may rarely appear at that time. Some patients tend to have a protracted course with ups and downs. In most cases, there are periods of time when the disease is worse, called exacerbations or flares, which are followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely, called remissions. Many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission of the disease when they get older, although their skin may remain somewhat dry and easily irritated.''Multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis, including low humidity, seasonal ''allergies'', exposure to harsh soaps and detergents, and ''cold'' weather. Environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time in the lives of individuals who have inherited the atopic disease trait.'  "
How common is atopic dermatitis?," Atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and increasing in prevalence. It affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). Atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children, and its onset decreases substantially with age. Of those affected, 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life, and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. Onset after age 30 is uncommon and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. People who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. About 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. Roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood. This means that more than 15 million people in the United States have symptoms of the disease."
What are the symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis?,"'Although symptoms and signs may vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.' Itch is the hallmark of the disease. Typically, affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face, and neck. The itchiness is an important factor in atopic dermatitis, because scratching and rubbing can worsen the skin inflammation that is characteristic of this disease. People with atopic dermatitis seem to be more sensitive to itching and feel the need to scratch longer in response. They develop what is referred to as the ""itch-scratch"" cycle. The extreme itchiness of the skin causes the person to scratch, which in turn worsens the itch, and so on. Itching is particularly a problem during sleep, when conscious control of scratching decreases and the absence of other outside stimuli makes the itchiness more noticeable."
What are the causes and risk factors of atopic dermatitis?,"'The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known, but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors. There seems to be a basic cutaneous hypersensitivity and an increased tendency toward itching. Evidence suggests that the disease is associated with other so-called atopic disorders such as hay ''fever'' (seasonal ''allergies'') and ''asthma'', which many people with atopic dermatitis also have.' In addition, many children who outgrow the symptoms of atopic dermatitis go on to develop hay fever or asthma. Although one disorder does not necessarily cause another, they may be related, thereby giving researchers clues to understanding atopic dermatitis. Many of those affected seem to have either a decreased quantity of or a defective form of a protein called filaggrin in their skin. This protein seem to be important in maintaining normal cutaneous hydration. It is important to understand that food sensitivities do not seem to be a major inciting factor for most cases of atopic dermatitis. This is an area of active research. Patients with atopic dermatitis seem to have mild immune system weakness. They are predisposed to develop fungal foot disease and cutaneous staphylococcal infections, and they can disseminate herpes simplex lip infections (eczema herpeticum) and smallpox vaccination (eczema vaccinatum) to large areas of skin. While emotional factors and stress may sometimes exacerbate the condition, they do not seem to be a primary or underlying cause for the disorder."
Can atopic dermatitis affect the face?,"'Yes. Atopic dermatitis may affect the skin around the eyes, the eyelids, the eyebrows, and lashes. Scratching and rubbing the eye area can cause the skin to change in appearance. Some people with atopic dermatitis develop an extra fold of skin under their eyes, called an atopic pleat or Dennie-Morgan fold. Other people may have hyperpigmented eyelids, meaning that the skin on their eyelids darkens from the inflammation or hay fever (allergic shiners). Patchy eyebrows and eyelashes may also result from scratching or rubbing.''The face is very commonly affected in ''babies'', who may drool excessively, and become irritated from skin contact with their abundant saliva.''The skin of a person with atopic dermatitis loses excessive moisture from the epidermal layer. Some patients with atopic dermatitis lack a protein called filaggrin that is important in retaining moisture. This defective genetic trait allows the skin to become very dry, which reduces its protective abilities. In addition, the skin is very susceptible to infectious disorders, such as staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial skin infections, ''warts'', herpes simplex, and ''molluscum contagiosum'' (which is caused by a virus).' Lichenification: thick, leathery skin resulting from constant scratching and rubbing Lichen simplex: refers to a thickened patch of raised skin that results from repeat rubbing and scratching of the same skin area Papules: small, raised bumps that may open when scratched, becoming crusty and infected Ichthyosis: dry, rectangular scales on the skin, commonly on the lower legs and shins Keratosis pilaris: small, rough bumps, generally on the face, upper arms, and thighs. These are also described as gooseflesh or chicken skin and may have a small coiled hair under each bump. Hyper-linear palms: increased number of skin creases on the palms Urticaria: hives (red, raised bumps), often after exposure to an allergen, at the beginning of flare-ups, or after exercise or a hot bath Cheilitis: inflammation of the skin on and around the lips Atopic pleat (Dennie-Morgan fold): an extra fold of skin that develops under the eye Dark circles under the eyes: may result from allergies and atopy Hyperpigmented eyelids: scaling eyelids that have become darker in color from inflammation or hay fever Prurigo nodules also called ""picker's warts"" are not really warts at all. These are small thickened bumps of skin caused by repeated picking of the same skin site."
Is atopic dermatitis contagious?,"'No. Atopic dermatitis itself is definitely not ''contagious'', and it cannot be passed from one person to another through skin contact. There is generally no cause for concern in being around someone with even an active case of atopic dermatitis, unless they have active skin infections.''Some patients with atopic dermatitis get secondary infections of their skin with ''Staphylococcus'' (""''staph''""), other bacteria, herpes virus (''cold sores''), and less commonly yeasts and other ''fungal infections''. These infections may be contagious through skin contact.' "
Atopic dermatitis vs. eczema,"'Eczema'' is a nonspecific term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis). There are different categories of ''eczema'', which include allergic, contact, irritant, and ''nummular eczema'', which can be difficult to distinguish from atopic dermatitis. These types of eczema are listed and briefly described below.''Atopy is a medical syndrome that includes three associated conditions that tend to occur in the same individual: atopic dermatitis, inhalant allergies, and asthma. All three components need not be present in the same individual simultaneously.' Contact eczema: a localized reaction that includes redness, itching, and burning where the skin has come into direct contact with an irritant such as an acid, a cleaning agent, or other chemical Allergic contact eczema: a red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy or certain chemicals or antibiotics in creams and lotions like neomycin (Neosporin) or bacitracin (Baciguent) Seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea) is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish, oily, scaly patches of skin on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally other parts of the body. Often this is also called dandruff in adults or ""cradle cap"" in infants. Nummular eczema: coin-shaped (round), isolated patches of irritated skin -- most commonly on the arms and lower legs -- that may be crusted, scaling, and extremely itchy Lichen simplex chronicus (localized neurodermatitis): a dermatitis localized to a particular anatomical area induced by long-term rubbing, scratching, or picking the skin. The underlying cause may be a sensitivity or irritation that sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. It may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks. Areas of thickened plaques form on the skin of the neck, shins, wrists, or forearms. This condition has certain similarities to calluses, and it will resolve if the patient stops irritating the area. Stasis dermatitis: a skin irritation on the lower legs, generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. It may have a darker pigmentation, light-brown, or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. It's sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins. Dyshidrotic eczema or pompholyx: irritation of the skin on the palms of hands (mostly) and less commonly soles of the feet characterized by clear, very deep-seated blisters that itch and burn. It's sometimes described as a ""tapioca pudding""-like rash on the palms. Xerotic eczema: areas of very dry skin most often seen on the lower legs of the elderly"
What are the stages of atopic dermatitis?,"'Atopic dermatitis seems to have a differing pattern of involvement depending on the age of a patient.''In infants, atopic dermatitis typically begins around 6 to 12 weeks of age.''In childhood, the rash tends to occur behind the knees and inside the elbows, on the sides of the neck, and on the wrists, ankles, and hands.''In those with more heavily pigmented skin, especially the face, areas of lighter skin color appear. This condition is called pityriasis alba. It is usually self-limited and the color will eventually normalize.''The disease may go into remission (disease-free period) for months or even years.' It may first appear around the cheeks and chin as a patchy facial rash, which can progress to red, scaling, oozing skin. The skin may become infected. Once the infant becomes more mobile and begins crawling, exposed areas such as the knees and elbows may also be affected. An infant with atopic dermatitis may be restless and irritable because of the itching and discomfort. Many infants improve by 18 months of age, although they remain at greater than normal risk for dry skin or hand eczema later in life. Often, the rash begins with papules that become hard and scaly when scratched. The skin around the lips may be inflamed, and constant licking of the area may lead to small, painful cracks. Severe eczema cases may affect growth, and the child may be shorter than average. In most children, the disease disappears after puberty. Although a number of people who developed atopic dermatitis as children also experience symptoms as adults, it is less common for the disease to show up first in adulthood. The pattern in adults is similar to that seen in children; that is, the disease may be widespread or limited. In some adults, only the hands or feet may be affected and become dry, itchy, red, and cracked. Sleep patterns and work performance may be affected, and long-term use of medications to treat the condition may cause complications. Adults with atopic dermatitis also have a predisposition toward irritant contact dermatitis, especially if they are in occupations involving frequent hand wetting, hand washing, or exposure to chemicals. Some people develop a rash around their nipples. These localized symptoms are difficult to treat, and people often do not tell their doctor because of modesty or embarrassment. Adults may also develop cataracts that are difficult to detect because they cause no symptoms. Therefore, the doctor may recommend regular eye exams."
Which types of doctors treat atopic dermatitis?,"'Pediatricians, allergists, and dermatologists care for most patients with atopic dermatitis.' "
What tests diagnose atopic dermatitis?,"'The diagnosis is made on the physical examination and visual inspection of the skin. The personal history of inhalant allergies and family history will often support the diagnosis. Although itching is necessary but not sufficient to diagnose atopic dermatitis, consideration of other itchy eruptions is often necessary.''A ''skin biopsy'' (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) is rarely helpful to establish the diagnosis. Many patients with severe atopic disease may have elevated numbers of a certain type of white blood cells (eosinophils) and/or elevated serum IgE level. These tests can support the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, skin swab (long cotton tip applicator or Q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude staphylococcal infections of the skin, which may complicate atopic dermatitis.''Skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis. Positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate.''Major features''Some minor features' Itching Characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) Chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms Personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema, hay fever, asthma) Early age of onset Dry, rough skin High levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody, in the blood Ichthyosis Hyper linear palms Keratosis pilaris Hand or foot dermatitis Cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) Nipple eczema Susceptibility to skin infection Positive allergy skin tests"
How can you prevent and avoid aggravating factors for atopic dermatitis?,"'Patients with atopic dermatitis should limit exposure to environmental and chemical factors known to cause exacerbations. These include dry skin, quick changes in temperature, the low humidity encountered during cold weather, and wool clothing.' "
What are skin irritants for atopic dermatitis?,"'Irritants are substances that directly damage the skin, and when used in high enough concentrations for long enough, cause the skin to become inflamed. Soaps, detergents, and even water may produce inflammation. Some perfumes and ''cosmetics'' may irritate the skin. Chlorine and alcoholic solvents, dust, or sand may also aggravate the condition. ''Cigarette'' smoke may irritate the eyelids.' Wool or synthetic fibers Soaps and detergents Some perfumes and cosmetics Substances such as chlorine, mineral oil, or solvents Dust or sand Dust mites Cigarette smoke Animal fur or dander Flowers and pollen"
What food allergies trigger atopic dermatitis?,"'Allergens are substances from foods, plants, or animals that provoke an overreaction of the immune system and cause inflammation (in this case, the skin). The importance of ''food allergy'' in atopic dermatitis is controversial. Although not all researchers agree, most experts think that ''breastfeeding'' the infant for at least four months may have a protective effect for the child. New lines of evidence even support exposing young children to normal environmental contaminants such as peanuts. Although such exposures may prevent the development of atopic dermatitis, there is no consensus on how to prevent the development of atopic diseases.''If a ''food allergy'' is suspected, it may be helpful to keep a careful diary of everything the patient eats, noting any reactions. Identifying the food allergen may be difficult and require supervision by an allergist if the patient is also being exposed to other allergens. One helpful way to explore the possibility of a food ''allergy'' is to eliminate the suspected food and then, if improvement is noticed, reintroduce it into the ''diet'' under carefully controlled conditions. A two-week trial is usually sufficient for each food. If the food being tested causes no symptoms after two weeks, a different food can be tested in like manner afterward. Likewise, if the elimination of a food does not result in improvement after two weeks, other foods may be eliminated in turn.''Changing the ''diet'"" of a person who has atopic dermatitis may not always relieve symptoms. A change may be helpful, however, when a patient's medical history and specific symptoms strongly suggest a food ""'allergy''. It is up to the patient and his or her family and physician to judge whether the dietary restrictions outweigh the impact of the disease itself. Restricted diets often are emotionally and financially difficult for patients and their families to follow. Unless properly monitored, diets with many restrictions can also contribute to nutritional problems in children.' "
What are aeroallergens?,"'Some allergens are called aeroallergens because they are present in the air. They may also play a role in atopic dermatitis.'""No reliable test is available that determines whether a specific aeroallergen is an exacerbating factor in any given individual. If the doctor suspects that an aeroallergen is contributing to a patient's symptoms, the doctor may recommend ways to reduce exposure to the offending agents. For example, the presence of the house dust ""'mite'' can be limited by encasing mattresses and pillows in special dust-proof covers, frequently washing bedding in hot water, and removing carpeting. However, there is no way to completely rid the environment of aeroallergens.' Common aeroallergens are dust mites, pollens, molds, and dander from animal hair or skin. These aeroallergens, particularly the house dust mite, may worsen the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in some people. Although some researchers think that aeroallergens are an important contributing factor to atopic dermatitis, others believe that they are insignificant."
What are home remedies for atopic dermatitis?,"""Treatment involves a partnership between the doctor and the patient and family members. The doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on the patient's age, symptoms, and general health. The patient and family members play a large role in the success of the treatment plan by carefully following the doctor's instructions. Some of the primary components of treatment programs are described below. Most patients can be successfully managed with proper ""'skin care'' and lifestyle changes and do not require the more intensive treatments discussed.''Skin care'': A simple and basic regimen is key. Staying with one recommended soap and one moisturizer is very important. Using multiple soaps, lotions, fragrances, and mixes of products may cause further issues and skin sensitivity.'""Healing the skin and keeping it healthy are of primary importance both in preventing further damage and enhancing the patient's quality of life. Developing and following a daily skin care routine is critical to preventing recurrent episodes of symptoms. The key factor is proper bathing and the application of an emollient to the wet skin without towel drying. Generally, an effective emollient is a reasonably stiff ointment or cream (one that does not move out of an opened inverted jar). People with atopic dermatitis should avoid hot baths and showers. A lukewarm bleach bath with a capful of chlorine bleach (Clorox) helps to cleanse and disinfect the skin. The doctor may recommend limited use of a mild bar soap or non-soap cleanser because soaps can be drying to the skin. Oatmeal baths are often helpful. Red, irritated areas can be treated with 1% hydrocortisone cream (two to three times a day), which can be obtained at most pharmacies and does not require a physician's prescription.""""Once the bathing is finished, apply an emollient immediately without towel drying. This restores the skin's moisture and inhibits the evaporation of water, increasing the rate of healing, and establishing a barrier against further drying and irritation. Lotions generally are discouraged because they have a high water or ""'alcohol'' content and evaporate quickly. Creams and ointments work better at healing the skin. Tar preparations can be very helpful in healing very dry, lichenified areas. Whatever preparation is chosen, it should be as free of fragrances and chemicals as possible.''Another key to protecting and restoring the skin is taking steps to avoid repeated skin infections. Although it may not be possible to avoid infections altogether, the effects of an infection may be minimized if they are identified and treated early. Patients and their families should learn to recognize the signs of skin infections, including tiny pustules (pus-filled bumps) on the arms and legs, appearance of oozing areas, or crusty yellow blisters. If symptoms of a skin infection develop, the doctor should be consulted to begin treatment as soon as possible.'   Give lukewarm baths. Apply an emollient immediately following the bath. Keep a child's fingernails filed short. Select soft cotton fabrics when choosing clothing. Consider using antihistamines to reduce scratching at night. Keep the child cool; consider a humidifier. Learn to recognize skin infections and seek treatment promptly. Attempt to distract the child with activities to keep him or her from scratching."
What is the treatment for atopic dermatitis?,"'If the disease does not respond to mild local ''over-the-counter'' treatment then a physician is required. With proper treatment, most symptoms can be brought under control within three weeks.''Additional available treatments may help to reduce specific symptoms of the disease.''Phototherapy is treatment with light that uses ultraviolet A or B light waves or a combination of both. This treatment can be an effective treatment for mild to moderate dermatitis in older children (over 12 years old) and adults. Photochemotherapy, a combination of ultraviolet light therapy and a drug called psoralen, can also be used in cases that are resistant to phototherapy alone. Possible long-term side effects of this treatment include premature skin ''aging'' and ''skin cancer''. If the doctor thinks that phototherapy may be useful in treating the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, he or she will use the minimum exposure necessary and monitor the skin carefully.''When other treatments are not effective, the doctor may prescribe systemic ''corticosteroids'', drugs that are taken by mouth or injected into muscle instead of being applied directly to the skin. An example of a commonly prescribed corticosteroid is ''prednisone''. Typically, these medications are used only in resistant cases and are only given for short periods of time. The side effects of systemic corticosteroids can include skin damage, thinned or weakened bones, ''high blood pressure'', ''high blood sugar'', infections, and ''cataracts''. It can be dangerous to suddenly stop taking corticosteroids, so it is very important that the doctor and patient work together in changing the corticosteroid dose.''In adults, immunosuppressive drugs, such as ''cyclosporine'', are also used to treat severe cases of atopic dermatitis that have failed to respond to any other forms of therapy. Immunosuppressive drugs restrain the overactive immune system by blocking the production of some immune cells and curbing the action of others.'""In extremely rare cases, when no other treatments have been successful, the patient may have to be hospitalized. A five- to seven-day hospital stay allows intensive skin care treatment and reduces the patient's exposure to irritants, allergens, and the stresses of day-to-day life. Under these conditions, the symptoms usually clear quickly if environmental factors play a role or if the patient is not able to carry out an adequate skin care program at home.""'Despite the symptoms caused by atopic dermatitis, it is possible for people with the disorder to maintain a high quality of life. The keys to an improved quality of life are education, awareness, and developing a partnership among the patient, family, and doctor. Good communication is essential for all involved. It is important that the doctor provides understandable information about the disease and its symptoms to the patient and family and demonstrate any treatment measures recommended to ensure that they will be properly carried out.''When a child has atopic dermatitis, the entire family situation may be affected. It is important that families have additional support to help them cope with the ''stress'' and frustration associated with the disease. The child may be fussy and difficult and often is unable to keep from scratching and rubbing the skin. Distracting the child and providing as many activities that keep the hands busy are key but require effort and work on the part of the parents or caregivers. Another issue a family may face is the social and emotional stress associated with disfigurement caused by atopic dermatitis. The child may face difficulty in school or other social relationships and may need additional support and encouragement from family members.' Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments are the most frequently used treatment. Since many of these are quite potent it will be necessary to have frequent physician visits to assure that the treatment is successful. Tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are non-steroid topical ointments that contain molecules that inhibit a substance called calcineurin which is important in inflammation. They rather expensive topical medicated creams that are used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. They are particularly effective in when used on the faces of children since they seem less likely to produce atrophy. These new drugs are referred to as ""immune modulators."" Crisaborole (Eucrisa), a recently approved topical treatment for children and adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) which seems to work by inhibiting a different portion of the inflammatory cascade in skin. Dupilumab (Duxipent) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults. It is an anti-IL-4 antibody that is given by injection twice a month and shows great promise in the control of severe atopic dermatitis. A newer class of OTC (over the counter) creams have been recently developed which claim to repair and improve the skin's barrier function in both children and adults. They include Atopiclair, MimyX, and CeraVe. These creams may be used in combination with topical steroids and other emollients to help repair the overall dryness and broken skin function. Oral antibiotics to treat staphylococcal skin infections can be helpful in the face of pyoderma. Certain antihistamines that cause drowsiness can reduce nighttime scratching and allow more restful sleep when taken at bedtime. This effect can be particularly helpful for patients whose nighttime scratching aggravates the disease. If viral or fungal infections are present, the doctor may also prescribe medications to treat those infections. The side effects of cyclosporine can include high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, kidney problems, headaches, tingling or numbness, and a possible increased risk of cancer and infections. There is also a risk of relapse after the drug is discontinued. Because of their toxic side effects, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used only in severe cases and then for as short a period of time as possible. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs should be referred to a dermatologist or an allergist specializing in the care of atopic dermatitis to help identify trigger factors and alternative therapies."
What is the prognosis of atopic dermatitis? Is there a cure?," Although symptoms of atopic dermatitis can be very difficult and uncomfortable, the disease can be successfully managed. People with atopic dermatitis, as well as their families, can lead healthy, normal lives. Long-term management may include treatment with an allergist to control inhalant allergies and a dermatologist to monitor the skin care component."
Facts you should know about eye allergies," Most allergic eye conditions are more irritating than dangerous. Allergic or vernal keratoconjunctivitis may result in scarring of the cornea and vision problems. Itchy, watery eyes are probably allergic eyes. Topical antihistamine/decongestant preparations are effective and safe for mildly itchy, puffy, red eyes. Patanol, a topical mast-cell stabilizer, is a safe, highly effective, long-acting treatment. Topical steroids should be used with caution and under the supervision of an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). If in doubt about an eye condition, seek medical advice from a doctor sooner rather than later."
Eye allergy introduction,"""The eyes are the windows to the soul because they reflect our state of mind. This certainly can't be true if our eyes are red, swollen, watery, and itchy from an ""'allergic reaction''. Severe allergic eye symptoms can be very distressing and are a common reason for visits to the allergist, ophthalmologist, and even the emergency room. Occasionally, severe ''eye allergies'' cause serious damage that can threaten eyesight.' "
What are eye allergy symptoms and signs?,"'Typical symptoms associated with eye ''allergies'' include inflammation of the ''conjunctiva'' that is caused by a reaction to allergens. The inflammation causes enlargement of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva (""''congestion''""), resulting in a red or bloodshot appearance of the eyes. These ''allergy symptoms'' can range from very mild redness to severe swelling associated with discharge.'  "
What causes eye allergies?,"'Eye ''allergies'' usually are associated with other allergic conditions, particularly ''hay fever'' (''allergic rhinitis'') and atopic ''eczema'' (''dermatitis''). The causes of eye ''allergies'' are similar to those of allergic ''asthma'' and hay ''fever''. Medications and ''cosmetics'' can play a significant role in causing eye allergies. Reactions to eye irritants and other ''eye conditions'' (for example, infections such as ''pink eye'') are often confused with eye ''allergy''. Any kind of irritant, whether environmental, infectious, or manmade, can cause symptoms consistent with eye allergies.'  "
What is the basic anatomy of the outer eye?,"'Eye allergies mainly involve the conjunctiva, which is the tissue lining (''mucus'' membrane) that covers the white surface of the eyeball and the inner folds of the eyelids. The conjunctiva is a barrier structure that is exposed to the environment and the many different allergens (substances that stimulate an allergic response) that become airborne. It is rich in blood vessels and contains more mast cells (cells that release histamine, a chemical mediator of allergic reactions) than the ''lungs''.''The lacrimal (tear) glands are located in the upper and outer portions of the eye. They are responsible for producing the watery part of tears, which keeps the eye moist and washes away irritants. The tears also contain important parts of the immune defense such as immunoglobulins (antibodies), lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells), and enzymes.''The cornea is the transparent sheath in front of the ''lens'' of the eye. The cornea has no blood vessels and very little immune activity.' "
Why are the eyes an easy target for allergies?,"'When you open your eyes, the conjunctiva becomes directly exposed to the environment without the help of a filtering system such as the cilia, the hairs commonly found in the nose.''Approximately 54 million people, about 20% of the U.S. population, have symptoms of allergies. Almost half of these people have allergic eye disease.''People who are more susceptible to allergic eye disease are those with a health history of allergic ''rhinitis'' and ''atopic dermatitis'' and those with a strong family and/or personal history of ''allergy''. Symptoms and signs usually appear before the age of 30.''The scenario for developing ''allergy'' symptoms and signs is much the same for the eyes as that for the nose. Allergens cause the allergy antibody IgE to coat numerous mast cells in the conjunctiva. Upon reexposure to the ''allergen'', the mast cell is prompted to release histamine and other mediators. The result is ''itching'', burning, and runny eyes that become red and irritated due to inflammation, which results in congestion and discomfort. The eyelids may swell, even to the point of closing altogether. Sometimes, the conjunctiva swells with fluid and protrudes from the surface of the eye, resembling a ""''hive''"" on the eye. These reactions may also induce light sensitivity. Typically, both eyes are affected by an allergic reaction. Occasionally, only one eye is involved, particularly when only one eye is rubbed with an allergen, as this causes mast cells to release more histamine.' "
What are allergic eye conditions?,"'Allergic conjunctivitis'', also called ""allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,"" is the most common allergic eye disorder. The condition is usually seasonal and is associated with hay ''fever''. The main cause is pollens, although ''indoor allergens'' such as dust mites, molds, and dander from household pets such as cats and ''dogs'' may affect the eyes year-round. Typical complaints include ''itching'', redness, tearing, burning, watery discharge, and ''eyelid'' swelling. To a large degree, the acute (initial) symptoms appear related to histamine release.''The treatments of choice are topical antihistamine drops such as olopatadine (Patanol), decongestants, and the newer mast-cell stabilizer medications. Topical steroids should be used only if prescribed by a doctor for severe reactions and on a short-term basis because of the potential for side effects. In general, oral ''antihistamines'' like ''loratadine'' (''Claritin'') or ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'') are the least effective option, but they are often used for treating allergic rhinitis together with allergic ''conjunctivitis''.''Rubbing itchy eyes is a natural response. However, rubbing usually worsens the allergic reaction due to the physical impact on the mast cells, which causes them to release more mediators of the immune response. Translation: Do not rub your eyes!''Commonly called ""atopic keratoconjunctivitis,"" this health condition is a notorious cause of severe eye changes, particularly in young adults. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis implies inflammation of both the conjunctiva and cornea. ""Kerato"" means pertaining to the cornea. This form of ''conjunctivitis'"" usually affects males 3 times more frequently than females and may begin in late adolescence. It's peak incidence is in males aged 30 to 50. It is more common in those who had ""'atopic dermatitis'' in early childhood. The condition is characterized by intensely itchy, red areas that appear on the eyelids. A heavy discharge from the eyes can occur, and the skin of the eyelid may show scales and crusts. In severe cases, the eyes become sensitive to light, and the eyelids noticeably thicken. If managed poorly, there can be permanent scarring of the cornea due to chronic rubbing and scratching of the eyes. This scarring can cause visual changes.''The triggers for atopic keratoconjunctivitis appear to be similar to those of ''atopic dermatitis''. A search for common ''food allergies'', such as eggs, peanuts, milk, ''soy'', wheat, or fish is important. Airborne allergens, particularly dust mites and pet dander, have been overlooked as a significant contributing factor and should be evaluated and controlled.''The hallmark of treatment for allergic ''conjunctivitis'' is the use of potent antihistamines (similar to those used in ''atopic dermatitis'') to subdue the itching. Topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, and the short-term use of oral steroids are all beneficial for relief of the itching. Occasionally, an infection of the area (usually with ''staphylococcus'', commonly referred to as ""''staph''"") worsens the symptoms, and antibiotic treatment may help control the itching. ''Allergy shots'' are useful in selected cases.''Atopic keratoconjunctivitis can lead to ''cataract'' formation in up to 10% of cases. In rare cases, ''blindness'' can occur.''Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is an uncommon health condition that tends to occur in preadolescent boys (3:1 male to female ratio) and is usually outgrown during the late ''teens'' or early adulthood. (Vernal is another term for ""spring."") Vernal keratoconjunctivitis usually appears in the late spring and particularly occurs in rural areas where dry, dusty, windy, and warm conditions prevail. The eyes become intensely itchy, sensitive to light, and the lids feel uncomfortable and droopy. The eyes produce a ""stringy"" discharge and, when examined, the surface under the upper eyelids appears ""cobblestoned."" A closer examination of the eye reveals severe inflammation due to the vast number of mast cells and accumulated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in the allergic response), producing so-called called ""Trantas dots.""''Improper treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis can lead to permanent visual impairment. The most effective treatment appears to be a short-term course of low-dose topical steroids. Topical mast-cell stabilizers and topical antihistamines can also be beneficial. Wraparound ''sunglasses'' are helpful to protect the eyes against wind and dust.''Keratitis'', or the inflammation of the cornea, in vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis is largely caused by a substance that is released from the eosinophils called major basic protein.''This health condition is named for its typical feature, large papillae, or ''bumps'', on the conjunctiva under the upper eyelid. These bumps are likely the result of irritation from a foreign substance, such as ''contact lenses''. Hard, soft, and rigid ''gas''-permeable lenses are all associated with the condition. The reaction is possibly linked to the protein buildup on the contact lens surface. This condition is believed, in part, to be due to an allergic reaction to either the contact lens itself, protein deposits on the contact lens, or the preservative in the solution for the contact lenses. Redness and itching of the eye develop, along with a thick discharge.''Allergy to contact lenses is most common among wearers of hard contact lenses and is least common among those who use disposable lenses, especially the one-day or one-week types. Sleeping with the contact lenses on greatly increases the risk of developing GPC.''The most effective treatment is to stop wearing the contact lenses. Occasionally, changing the type of lens in addition to more frequent cleaning or using disposable daily wear lenses will prevent the condition from recurring.''The giant papillae on the conjunctiva, which are characteristic of GPC, however, may persist for months despite these measures. Eye medications, such as ''cromolyn'' (''Opticrom'') or lodoxamide (''Alomide''), often are used in this condition, sometimes for several months. Contact lenses should not be worn while these medications are being used.'  "
What are eyelid allergies (also called contact eye allergies)?,"'Contact eye allergies are essentially ''contact dermatitis'' of the eyelids. This is allergic inflammation of the eyelid from direct contact with certain allergens. Women in particular may experience this problem due to allergic reactions to preservatives in eye products and ''makeup'' (for example, eye creams, eyeliner or eye pencils, mascara, and nail ''polish -- from'' rubbing the eye with the fingers). Other irritants include common ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ointments such as ''neomycin''/bacitracin/polymyxin (''Neosporin'' or Bacitracin) as well as contact lens solutions (especially if they contain thimerosal). Symptoms and signs that are similar to those of a ''poison ivy'' ''rash'' appear 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the offending agent. The eyelids may develop ''blisters'', itching, and redness. The conjunctiva may also become red and watery. If the eyelids continually come into contact with the offending allergens, the lids may become chronically (long term) inflamed and thickened.''The best treatment for eyelid allergies is avoidance of the sensitizing agent(s). Changing to hypoallergenic lens solutions, cosmetics, or topical ''eye care'' products is usually necessary. Application of a mild topical ''corticosteroid'' cream for short periods will probably help. As is the case with atopic dermatitis, it is important to treat any secondary bacterial ''skin infection'' that may develop.'  "
What conditions can be confused with eye allergies?,"'The following is a list of health conditions, the symptoms of which are commonly confused with eye allergy.' Dry eye: This condition results from reduced tear production and is frequently confused with allergy. The main symptoms are usually burning, grittiness, or the sensation of ""something in the eye."" Dry eye usually occurs in people over 65 years of age and can certainly be worsened by oral antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), hydroxyzine (Atarax), Claritin, or Zyrtec, sedatives, and beta-blocker medications. Tear-duct obstruction: This is caused by a blockage in the tear passage that extends from the eyes to the nasal cavity. This condition is also typically seen in the elderly. The main complaint is watery eyes that do not itch. Allergy testing will be negative in this case. Conjunctivitis due to infection can be caused by either bacteria or viruses. In bacterial infections, the eyes are often ""bright red"" and the eyelids stick together, especially in the morning. A discolored mucous discharge is often seen, so-called ""dirty eyes."" Viral conjunctivitis causes slight redness of the eyes and a glassy appearance from tearing. Adenovirus is a major cause of viral conjunctivitis. Herpes viruses, such as the varicella virus that causes chickenpox or shingles, can also affect the eye. Adenovirus infection is very contagious and may be spread by either direct contact, such as hand contact, or in contaminated swimming pools. You should seek medical attention if you suspect any of the above. If your eye itches and is ""milky"" red, it is most likely allergy. If it burns, it is probably dry eye. If it ""sticks"" in the morning and is bright red, it is usually bacterial or viral conjunctivitis."
What is the treatment for eye allergies? Are there home remedies for eye allergies?,"'Most people with eye allergies treat themselves and do so quite effectively with OTC eye care products. Most commonly, home care consists of an allergy sufferer flushing the eye with water. With exposure to an allergen to the eye, it is important to thoroughly ''flush'' the eye with lukewarm tap water or commercially prepared eyewash solution. If these remedies are not working or if there is ''eye pain'', extreme redness, or heavy discharge, you should seek medical advice. Some conditions, for example, are serious with potential sight-threatening health complications if required treatment is delayed.''Moistening the eyes with artificial tears helps to dilute accumulated allergens and also prevents the allergens from sticking to the conjunctiva. Tear substitutes may also improve the defense function of the natural tear film.''Antihistamine eye drops work by blocking histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The histamine, therefore, is unable to attach to the conjunctiva and exert its effects. They are effective in relieving itching but have little impact on swelling or redness. They have two advantages over antihistamine tablets; there is a quicker onset of action and less drying of the eye. The new generation of topical antihistamines includes emedastine difumarate (''Emadine'') and levocabastine (''Livostin''). The side effects of these medications include mild stinging and burning of the eyes upon use, ''headaches'', and sleepiness. But treatment with antihistamines at the point of irritation is still preferable than treating systemically with oral antihistamines if possible.''Decongestants take the redness away as advertised. However, they do not help relieve itching. They act by shrinking the blood vessels on the conjunctiva. (They are not really effective against allergic eyes.) The decongestants oxymetazdine (''Visine'' LR) and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride (Visine Original) are available OTC. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle ''glaucoma'', an eye disease characterized by elevated pressure within the eye.''The prolonged use of decongestant nasal sprays can produce a rebound phenomenon in which the medication begins to cause more congestion than it relieves. This phenomenon rarely occurs in the eyes with the repeated use of decongestant drops. The mucous membranes of the eye are different from those of the nose. The eyes can become irritated and less responsive to the drops, but unlike the nose, the eyes tend not to develop ""rebound"" redness.''Combination antihistamine-decongestant preparations can provide quick relief that lasts a few hours. They lessen the ''itch'', redness, and swelling and are very useful for milder symptoms. Common combinations include pheniramine with naphcyoline hydrochloride (''Naphcon-A'' or ''Opcon-A'') and antazoline with naphazoline (''Vasocon''-A). Side effects are minimal, but the drops may become less effective if used for prolonged periods. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle ''glaucoma''.''Mast-cell stabilizers prevent the release of chemical mediators of inflammation from the mast cells. These are effective for all eye allergies. The first of this class of drug was cromolyn sodium (Crolom or Opticrom), which is available OTC. This topical medicine has been effective for treating mild cases of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and probably mild allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and has no significant side effects. It does have a slow onset of action. The newer agent, lodoxamide (Alomide), is 2,500 times more potent than Crolom and has a faster onset of action. This prescription medicine may be used in children older than 2 years of age and has minimal side effects. One disadvantage is the need to use the drops four times a day, and long-term use is necessary to prevent symptoms.''The most effective mast-cell stabilizer, which also has antihistamine properties, is olopatadine (Patanol). Available by prescription, it is 250 times more effective than Alomide in relieving itching and redness. This drug provides rapid relief of itching and burning eyes. It can also prevent symptoms when used before an exposure or before the ''pollen'' season. The drops are very comfortable in the eye and can be used in children as young as 3 years old. The longer duration of action allows dosing of twice a day.''Another new product, ketotifen (''Zaditor''), also has dual mast-cell-stabilizing and antihistamine effects. It dramatically reduces itching and redness and gives more rapid relief within minutes.''Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (''NSAIDS'') are particularly useful in treating itchy eyes. They reduce redness and swelling to a lesser degree. ''Ketorolac'' (''Acular'') is a topical ''NSAID'', which may cause temporary stinging and burning in 40% of users.''Steroid antiinflammatory eyedrops are very effective in treating eye allergies, but they are reserved for severe symptoms that are unresponsive to other treatments. They must be used with caution in people with bleeding tendencies because they can increase the bleeding risk. Since there are significant risks with long-term treatment, their use should be supervised by an ophthalmologist.''Caution must be taken, however, because of the potential side effects of the long-term use of steroids, even in eye drop form. Side effects of steroids include elevated pressure in the eyes and ''cataracts''. The elevated pressure in the eyes can become glaucoma and lead to damage of the optic (eye) nerve and ''loss of vision''. ''Cataracts'' are a clouding or opacification of the clear natural lens within the eye, which can interfere with vision. The purpose of the lens is to focus the light or images that enter the eye. Remember, however, that the side effects of steroids usually occur with long-term use and that steroid eye drops may be very effective when used over the short term. Loteprednol etabonate (Alrex) is a short-acting steroid with fewer side effects that shows great promise in the treatment of allergic eye disease.''Topical steroids may cause or worsen glaucoma and result in cataracts with long-term use. About 500 drops of a high-dose preparation can cause cataracts. Also, remember that with topical steroid eye drops, short-term, low-potency preparations are recommended and should only be used under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.''Oral antihistamines, either OTC or prescription (non- or lightly sedating), may be used for itchy eyes. The OTC products may cause drowsiness, and both can cause drying of the eyes.''In general, treating topical conditions with topical medications is preferable.''When avoidance of offending allergens and local treatments are not effective, allergy shots may be indicated. Your allergist may suggest this form of treatment when other measures have been unsuccessful.''Here are a few general tips worth remembering:'   Eyes that are dry may aggravate eye allergy symptoms. Tear substitutes, such as artificial tears, are an often forgotten but are an effective lubricant. Cold compresses may help, particularly with sudden allergic reactions and swollen eyes. Keep eyedrops refrigerated since this makes application more soothing."
What is the prognosis of eye allergies?,"'The prognosis is favorable for most patients with eye allergies. Typically symptoms clear up quickly with OTC/home treatment or when the offending allergen is not present any more. Unfortunately the symptoms may reoccur depending on the cause of the eye allergy. Health complications are very rare, but medical attentions should be sought immediately for any ''pain'' or ''vision loss'' that occurs or for symptoms that do not resolve within 12 hours.' "
Is it possible to prevent eye allergies?,"'Avoidance is the cornerstone of allergy treatment. It is particularly important to avoid both airborne and contact allergens. Remember, rubbing your eyes is a physical trigger and therefore care should be taken to avoid this.'  "
What is a food allergy?,"'Either food allergy or food intolerance affects nearly everyone at some point. When people have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate, they often think that they have an allergy to the food. Actually, however, research shows that only about 3% of adults and 6%-8% of children have clinically proven true ''allergic'' reactions to food.'""This difference between the prevalence of clinically proven food allergy and the public's perception of the problem is due primarily to misinterpreting food intolerance or other adverse reactions to food as food allergy. A true food allergy is an abnormal response to food (known as a food ""'allergen'') that is triggered by a specific reaction in the immune system and expressed by certain, often characteristic, symptoms. Other kinds of reactions to foods that are not food ''allergies'' include food intolerances (such as lactose or milk intolerance), ''food poisoning'', and toxic reactions. Food intolerance also is an abnormal response to food, and its symptoms can resemble those of food allergy. Food intolerance, however, is far more prevalent, occurs in a variety of diseases, and is triggered by several different mechanisms that are distinct from the immunological reaction responsible for food allergy.''People who have food allergies must identify and prevent them because, although usually mild and not severe, these reactions can cause devastating illness and, in rare instances, can be fatal.'  "
What causes allergic reactions to food?,"'Both heredity and environmental factors may play a role in the development of food allergy. The allergens in food are those ingredients that are responsible for inciting an ''allergic reaction''. They are proteins that usually resist the heat of cooking, the acid in the stomach, and the intestinal ''digestive enzymes''. As a result, the allergens survive to cross the gastrointestinal lining, enter the bloodstream causing (protein-induced) allergic reactions throughout the body. The mechanism of food allergy involves the immune system and heredity.''Immune system'': An allergic reaction to food involves two components of the immune system. One component is a type of protein, an allergy antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which circulates through the blood. The other is the mast cell, a specialized cell that stores up histamine and is found in all tissues of the body. The mast cell is particularly found in areas of the body that are typically involved in allergic reactions, including the nose and throat, ''lungs'', skin, and gastrointestinal tract.''Heredity'': The tendency of an individual to produce IgE against something seemingly as innocuous as food appears to be ''inherited''. Generally, people with allergies come from families in which allergies are common -- not necessarily to food but perhaps allergies to ''pollen'', fur, feathers, or ''drugs''. Thus, a person with two allergic parents is more likely to develop food allergies than someone with one allergic parent.''Mechanism'': Food allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction, meaning that before an allergic reaction to an allergen in food can occur, a person needs to have been exposed previously, or ""sensitized,"" to the food. At the initial exposure, the allergen stimulates lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells) to produce the IgE antibody that is specific for the allergen. This IgE then is released and attaches to the surface of the mast cells in different tissues of the body. The next time the person eats that particular food, its allergen hones in on the specific IgE antibody on the surface of the mast cells and prompts the cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending upon the tissue in which they are released, these chemicals cause the various symptoms of food allergy.' "
What are food allergy risk factors?,"""Both adults and children may develop food allergies. Factors that increase one's risk of having a food allergy include the following:"" Young age: Food allergies are most common in infants and toddlers. Having a past food allergy as a child or an allergy to another food: Those who are allergic to one type of food are more likely to develop other food allergies. Adults who have outgrown food allergies they had as children are more likely to develop subsequent food allergies than people who have never had them. Family or personal history of allergy, eczema, asthma, or hay fever increases the chances for developing a food allergy."
What are food allergy symptoms and signs?,"'The complex process of digestion affects the timing, location, and particular symptoms of an allergic reaction to food. All of the symptoms of food allergy occur within a few minutes to an hour of eating. A food allergy can initially be experienced as an ''itching'' in the mouth and ''difficulty swallowing'' and breathing. Then, during digestion of the food in the stomach and ''intestines'', symptoms such as ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''abdominal pain'' can start. Incidentally, the gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy are those that are most often confused with the symptoms of different types of food intolerance.''As mentioned previously, the allergens are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. When they reach the skin, allergens can induce hives or ''eczema'', and when they reach the airways, they can cause ''asthma''. As the allergens travel through the blood vessels, they can cause ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''anaphylaxis'', which is a sudden drop in ''blood pressure''. Anaphylactic reactions are severe even when they start off with mild symptoms, such as a tingling in the mouth and throat or discomfort in the abdomen. They can be fatal if not treated quickly.'  "
What is exercise-induced food allergy?,"'Exercise'' can induce an allergic reaction to food. The usual scenario is that of a person eating a specific food and then exercising. As he exercises and his body temperature increases, he begins to ''itch'', gets lightheaded, and soon develops the characteristic allergic reactions of hives, asthma, abdominal symptoms, and even anaphylaxis. This condition has been referred to as food-dependent ''exercise''-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) and is most common in ''teens'' and young adults. The cure, actually a preventive measure, for exercise-induced food allergy is simple -- not eating for at least two hours before exercising.' "
Do infants and children have problems with food allergy?,"""Most allergies to foods begin in the first or second year of life. While some of these reactions may resolve over time (such as allergies to cow's milk or eggs), other food allergies acquired in infancy (such as allergies to nuts or shellfish) typically persist throughout life. Allergies to milk or ""'soy'' formula (a milk substitute made from soybeans) sometimes occur in infants and young children. These early allergies sometimes do not involve the usual hives or asthma but rather can cause symptoms in ''babies'' resembling infantile ''colic'', and perhaps ''blood in the stool'', or poor growth.''The clinical picture of infantile ''colic'', which usually starts within one month of birth, is that of a crying child who sleeps poorly at night. The cause of colic is uncertain. A variety of psychosocial and dietary factors have been implicated, however, and ''allergy to milk'' or soy has been proposed as a cause of colic in a minority of infants with colic.'""In infants, food allergy is usually diagnosed by observing the effect of changing the infant's diet; rarely, by using a food challenge. If the baby is on cow's milk, the doctor will suggest a change to soy formula or breast-feeding only, if possible. If the soy causes an allergic reaction, the baby can be placed on an elemental formula. These formulas are processed proteins and carbohydrates, basically amino acids and sugars, and contain few, if any, allergens.""'Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)'' is a bowel condition that affects children and is sometimes referred to as a delayed food allergy. It often occurs in infants who are beginning to eat solid foods. Unlike a typical food allergy, the symptoms come on hours after a food is consumed. It is a serious illness accompanied by vomiting and ''diarrhea''. In severe cases, ''dehydration'' and ''shock'' can result due to the fluid lost from diarrhea and vomiting. Milk, soy, and grains are the foods that most often trigger FPIES. Research has suggested that FPIES results from a different mechanism than the production of IgE antibodies seen with typical allergic reactions.''Breastfeeding'': Exclusive breastfeeding, that is, excluding all other foods, for at least the first four months of life appears to help protect high-risk children against ''milk allergy'' and ''eczema'' in the first two years of life. ''Breast milk'"" contains less protein that is foreign to the infant and, therefore, is less allergenic than cow's milk or soy formula. Exclusive breastfeeding should be a consideration, therefore, especially in infants who are predisposed to food allergy. Some children are so sensitive to a certain food, however, that if the mother eats that food, sufficient quantities enter the breast milk to cause a reaction to the food in the child. In this situation, the mothers themselves must avoid eating those foods to which the baby is allergic. No conclusive evidence has been obtained that suggests that breastfeeding prevents the development of allergies later in life.""'Special considerations in children'': An allergic child who itches, sneezes, and wheezes a lot can feel miserable and, therefore, sometimes misbehave or appear hyperactive. At the other extreme, children who are on allergy medicines that can cause drowsiness may become sleepy in school or at home. Parents and caregivers must understand these different behaviors, protect the children from the foods that induce their allergies, and know how to manage an allergic reaction, including how to administer epinephrine. Also, schools need to have plans in place to address emergencies, including ''anaphylactic shock''.' "
What are the most common food allergies?,"'According to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, eight foods are responsible for most food allergies:''In adults, the most common foods that cause allergic reactions are shellfish, such as shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab; nuts from trees, such as walnuts; fish; eggs; and peanuts, a legume that is one of the chief foods that cause serious anaphylactic reactions. In highly allergic people, even minuscule amounts of a food allergen (for example, 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can evoke an allergic reaction. Less sensitive people, however, may be able to tolerate small amounts of a food to which they are allergic.'""In children, the pattern is somewhat different from adults, and the most common foods that cause allergic reactions are eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, soy, fish, and fruits, particularly tomatoes and strawberries. Children sometimes outgrow their allergies, but adults usually do not lose theirs. Also, children are more likely to outgrow allergies to cow's milk or soy formula than allergies to peanuts, fish, or shrimp. Adults and children tend to react to those foods they eat more often. For example, in Japan, allergy to rice, and in Scandinavia, allergy to codfish, is more common than elsewhere.""   Cow's milk Eggs Fish Peanuts Shellfish Soy Tree nuts Wheat"
What is cross-reactivity?,"'Cross-reactivity is the occurrence of allergic reactions to foods or other substances that are chemically or otherwise related to foods known to cause allergy in an individual. If someone has a life-threatening reaction to a certain food, the doctor will counsel that patient to avoid related foods due to possible cross-reactivity, which also might induce the same reaction. For example, if a person has a history of a severe allergy to shrimp, he or she can also possibly be allergic to crab, lobster, and crayfish.' "
What is oral allergy syndrome?,"'The oral allergy syndrome is another type of cross-reactivity. This syndrome occurs in people who are highly sensitive, for example, to ragweed or birch pollen. During the seasons that these allergens pollinate, the affected individual may find that when he or she tries to eat fruits, chiefly melons and apples, a rapid onset of itching is experienced in the mouth and throat, and the fruit cannot be eaten. The oral allergy syndrome is also known as pollen-food allergy syndrome and is thought to be a type of ''contact allergy'' related to the presence of proteins in certain foods that cross react with allergy-causing pollen proteins. Oral allergy syndrome occurs in up to 50% of those who have ''allergic rhinitis'' caused by pollen. Symptoms are immediate upon ingestion of fresh or uncooked foods and include the itching, irritation, and mild swelling of the lips, tongue, palate, and throat. Cooked fruits and vegetables usually do not cause the reaction. The symptoms usually go away within minutes, although up to 10% of people will develop systemic (body-wide) symptoms, and a small number (1%-2%) may experience anaphylactic shock. Tree nuts and peanuts tend to cause more severe reactions than other foods.' "
What conditions have mistakenly been attributed to food allergy?,"'Research studies have shown that individuals who are prone to ''migraines'' can have their ''headaches'' brought on by histamine, which is one of the compounds that mast cells produce in an allergic reaction. The theory that food allergies can cause ''migraine'' ''headaches'', however, is unproven. There is also inadequate scientific research evidence to support the claims that food allergies can cause or aggravate ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''osteoarthritis'', tension-''fatigue'' syndrome, cerebral allergy (''headaches'' and ''difficulty concentrating''), environmental-toxic reactions, or ''hyperactivity'' in children.' "
What types of health care specialists diagnose and treat food allergies?,"'Allergists (including pediatric allergists) are medical doctors who have had special education and training in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies, including food allergies.' "
What is histamine toxicity? Is it a type of food allergy?,"'There are many conditions that can mimic food allergy. It is critical to distinguish true food allergy from other abnormal responses to food, that is, from food intolerance, which can occur in a variety of other illnesses or ''food poisoning'', which occurs when contaminated food is ingested. If a patient says to the doctor, ""I think I have a food allergy,"" the doctor has to consider a number of diagnoses. The possibilities include not only food allergy but also any other diseases that have symptoms brought on by food. These include reactions to certain chemicals in food for example, histamine or food additives, food poisoning, several other gastrointestinal diseases, and psychological symptoms.' Histamine toxicity: Some natural substances (for example, histamine) in foods can cause reactions resembling allergy. Histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and certain fish, particularly tuna and mackerel. In fish, the histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination, especially in fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Remember that mast cells release histamine in an allergic reaction. If a person eats a food that contains a high level of histamine, therefore, he may develop histamine toxicity, a response that strongly resembles an allergic reaction to food. Histamine toxicity has been referred to as pseudoallergic fish poisoning and accounts for over one-third of seafood-related food-borne illnesses, according to research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
Are food poisoning and food allergies the same condition? Is lactose deficiency a food allergy?," Food poisoning: Eating food that is contaminated with microorganisms, such as bacteria, and their products, such as toxins, is the usual cause of food poisoning. Thus, the ingestion of contaminated eggs, salad, milk, or meat can produce symptoms that mimic food allergy. Common microbes that can cause food poisoning include the noroviruses, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnificus, and E. coli 0157:H7. Lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): Another cause of food intolerance, which often is confused with a food allergy, specifically to milk, is lactase deficiency. This common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. This enzyme digests or breaks down lactose, a complex sugar in milk, to simple sugars, which are then absorbed into the blood. If a person has lactase deficiency, he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. Instead, other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose, thereby producing gas. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In a diagnostic test for lactase deficiency, the patient ingests a specific amount of lactose. Then, by analyzing a blood sample for simple sugars, the doctor determines the patient's ability to digest the lactose and absorb the simple sugars. A lower than normal value usually means a lactase deficiency."
"Are gluten-sensitive enteropathy, other gastrointestinal diseases, or phychological factors related to food allergies?"," Gluten-sensitive enteropathy: Intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or celiac sprue (also called celiac disease). A unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten, which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease. Although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten, research has revealed that this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. It involves a misdirected immune system, referred to as autoimmunity. The patients have an abnormality in the lining of the small intestine and experience diarrhea and malabsorption, especially of dietary fat. The treatment for this condition involves consuming a gluten-free diet. Other gastrointestinal diseases: Several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. These diseases, therefore, can resemble food allergies. Examples include peptic ulcer, gallstones, non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion), Crohn's disease (regional enteritis), cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Psychological: Some people have a food intolerance that has a psychological origin. In these people, a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify a traumatic event in that person's life, often during childhood, tied to eating a particular food. The eating of that food years later, even as an adult, is associated with a rush of symptoms that can resemble an allergic reaction to food."
How do health care professionals diagnose food allergies? What tests do health specialists use to diagnose food allergies?,"""To diagnose food allergy, a health care professional first must determine if the patient is having an adverse reaction to specific foods. A history of foods consumed and resulting symptoms is key information for the physician in the early stages of diagnosis. The doctor makes an assessment with the help of a detailed history from the patient, the patient's dietary diary, or an elimination diet. He or she then confirms the diagnosis by the more objective skin tests, blood tests, or food challenges.""'History'': The health history usually is the most important diagnostic tool in diagnosing food allergy. The physician interviews the patient to determine if the facts are consistent with a food allergy. The health care professional may ask the following questions:'   What was the timing of the reaction? Did the reaction come on quickly, usually within an hour after eating the food? Was treatment for allergy successful? For example, if hives stem from a food allergy, antihistamines should relieve them. Is the reaction always associated with a certain food? Did anyone else get sick? For example, if the person has eaten fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate the fish should be sick. In an allergic reaction, however, only the person allergic to the fish becomes ill. How much did the patient eat before experiencing a reaction? The severity of the patient's reaction can sometimes relate to the amount of the suspect food eaten. How was the food prepared? Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish. A thorough cooking of the fish destroys those allergens in the fish to which they react, so that they then can eat it with no allergic reaction. Were other foods eaten at the same time as the food that caused the allergic reaction? Fatty foods can delay digestion and thus delay the onset of the allergic reaction."
What skin and blood tests diagnose the causes of food allergies?," Skin tests: In a percutaneous skin prick-puncture skin test, a dilute extract of the suspected food is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. This portion of the skin then is punctured or pricked with a needle and observed for swelling or redness, which would signify a local allergic reaction to the food. A positive prick-puncture test indicates that the patient has the IgE antibody that is specific for the food being tested on the skin's mast cells. Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe.A person can have a positive skin test to a food allergen, however, without experiencing allergic reactions to that food. A doctor diagnoses a food allergy only when the patient has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and the history suggests an allergic reaction to the same food. In some highly allergic people, however, especially if they have had anaphylactic reactions, skin tests should not be done because they could provoke another dangerous reaction. Skin tests also cannot be done in patients with extensive eczema. A person can have a positive skin test to a food allergen, however, without experiencing allergic reactions to that food. A doctor diagnoses a food allergy only when the patient has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and the history suggests an allergic reaction to the same food. In some highly allergic people, however, especially if they have had anaphylactic reactions, skin tests should not be done because they could provoke another dangerous reaction. Skin tests also cannot be done in patients with extensive eczema. Blood tests: In those situations where skin tests cannot be done, a doctor may use blood tests such as the RAST, ImmunoCap, and the ELISA. These tests measure the presence of food-specific IgE antibodies in the blood of patients, but they cost more than skin tests, and the results are not available immediately. As with positive skin tests, positive blood tests make the diagnosis of a specific food allergy only when the clinical history is compatible."
What types of diets help diagnose the cause of food allergies?,"""If the patient's history, dietary diary, or elimination diet suggests that a specific food allergy is likely, the doctor then will use tests, such as skin tests, blood tests, and a food challenge, which can more objectively confirm an allergic response to food."" Dietary diary: Sometimes, a history alone cannot determine the diagnosis. In that situation, the doctor may ask the patient to keep a record of the contents of each meal and whether reactions occurred that are consistent with allergy. The dietary diary provides more details than the oral history, so that the doctor and patient can better determine if there is a consistent relationship between a food and the allergic reactions. Elimination diet: The next step that some doctors use is an elimination diet. Under the doctor's direction, the patient does not eat a food suspected of causing the allergy (for example, eggs) and substitutes another food (in this instance, another source of protein). If after the patient removes the food, the symptoms go away, the doctor almost always can make a diagnosis of food allergy. If the patient then resumes eating the food (still under the doctor's direction) and the symptoms return, this sequence confirms the diagnosis. The patient should not resume eating the food, however, if the allergic reactions have been severe because this re-challenge is too risky. This technique is also not suitable if the allergic reactions have been infrequent."
What are food allergy treatments?,"'Dietary avoidance'': Avoiding the offending allergen in the diet is the primary focus of food allergy treatment. Once a food to which the patient is sensitive has been identified, the food must be removed from the diet. To do this, affected people need to read lengthy, detailed lists of ingredients on the label for each food they consider eating. Many allergy-producing foods such as peanuts, eggs, and milk appear in foods that are not ordinarily associated with them. For example, peanuts often are used as protein ''supplements'', eggs are found in some salad dressings, and milk is in bakery products. The FDA requires that the ingredients in a food be listed on its label, and careful attention to food labels is critical for anyone with food allergies. People can avoid most of the foods to which they are sensitive if they carefully read the labels on foods and, when in ''restaurants'', avoid ordering foods that might contain ingredients to which they are allergic.''Treating an anaphylactic reaction'': People with severe food allergies must be prepared to treat an anaphylactic reaction. Education about the signs of a reaction and how to manage the reaction is essential. Even those who know a lot about their own allergies can either make an error or be served food that does not comply with their instructions, including food that may have had cross-contact with allergy-causing foods during cooking or preparation. To protect themselves, people who have had anaphylactic reactions to a food should wear medical alert bracelets or necklaces stating that they have a food allergy and that they are subject to severe reactions. These individuals also always should carry a syringe of adrenaline (epinephrine [''EpiPen'', ''Auvi-Q'']), obtained by prescription from their doctors; people with severe food allergies should be prepared to self-administer epinephrine if they think they are developing an allergic reaction. They then should immediately seek medical help by either calling the rescue squad or having themselves transported to an emergency room.''Treating other symptoms of food allergy'': Several medications are available for treating the other symptoms of food allergy. For example, antihistamines can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms, hives, ''sneezing'', and a ''runny nose''. ''Bronchodilators'' can relieve the ''symptoms of asthma''. These medications are taken after a person inadvertently has ingested a food to which he is allergic. They are not effective, however, in preventing an allergic reaction when taken prior to eating the food. In fact, no medication in any form is available to reliably prevent an allergic reaction to a certain food before eating that food.'  "
Are allergy shots effective in preventing or decreasing food allergy?,"'Allergy shots'', a form of treatment known as immunotherapy, involve injecting small quantities of substances to which the patient is allergic. The shots are given regularly for a long time with the aim of desensitizing the patient or getting the patient to tolerate the allergen without developing symptoms. This type of therapy is effective in controlling symptoms of allergies related to hay ''fever'', ''indoor allergens'', and ''insect stings''. Researchers, however, have not yet proven that these shots can prevent any allergic reactions to food.'  "
What are complications of food allergies?,"'The most serious complication, as mentioned earlier, is the development of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for food allergy?,"'As described above, avoidance of the trigger food is the primary treatment for food allergy. The outlook is excellent for those who are able to avoid consuming the allergen and who remain prepared to treat a ''severe allergic reaction'' such as anaphylaxis. There are no long-term complications associated with food allergy, other than the risk for severe reactions.' "
What research is being done on food allergies?,"'Research is ongoing in many areas of food allergy. Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) is an organization that awards research grants to investigators who are studying questions such as who gets food allergies and the possible role of factors including diet, hygiene, geography, ethnicity, and others in causing food allergy. FARE also has resources and education for families and patients suffering from food allergy.''Food allergy is caused by immune reactions to foods, sometimes in individuals or families predisposed to allergies. A number of foods, especially shellfish, milk, eggs, peanuts, and fruit can cause allergic reactions (notably hives, asthma, abdominal symptoms, lightheadedness, and anaphylaxis) in adults or children. When a food allergy is suspected, a medical evaluation is the key to proper management.''It is important to distinguish a true food allergy from other abnormal responses to food, that is, food intolerances, which actually are far more common than food allergy. Once the diagnosis of food allergy is made (primarily by the medical history) and the allergen is identified (usually by skin tests), the treatment basically is to avoid the offending food. People with food allergies should work with their physicians and become knowledgeable about allergies and how they are diagnosed and treated.' "
What is the oral food challenge used to diagnose food allergies?," Oral food challenge: The double-blind food challenge has become the gold standard for objective allergy testing. (Some physicians prefer the term double-masked, rather than double-blind.) In this test, various foods, some of which are suspected of inducing an allergic reaction, are placed in individual opaque capsules. Both the patient and the doctor are blinded, so that neither of them knows which capsules contain the suspected allergens. (The capsules are prepared by another medical worker.) The patient swallows a capsule and the doctor then observes whether an allergic reaction occurs. This process is repeated with each capsule. Alternatively, the food to be tested may be disguised in another type of food to which the person is not allergic.The advantage of a food challenge is that if the patient has an allergic reaction only to the suspected foods and not to the other foods tested, the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. Just as with a re-challenge after the elimination diet and with the skin tests, however, someone having a history of severe reactions should not be tested with a food challenge because of the danger of inducing another severe reaction. In addition, this procedure is expensive because it is difficult and requires a lot of time, especially for patients with multiple food allergies. This type of test must also be done under the careful supervision of a physician. Consequently, double-blind food challenges are done infrequently. They are done most commonly, however, when the doctor wishes to obtain evidence to confirm the suspicion that the patient's symptoms are not due to a food allergy. Then, additional efforts may be directed at finding the real cause of the patient's symptoms.

Allergy Treatment Begins at Home,"'Avoidance is always the best treatment for allergies regardless of which allergens are the triggers. Interestingly enough, the most effective, least expensive, and simplest options are not always followed. Many people choose medications or ''vaccinations'' instead, despite their drawbacks. Fortunately, there are lots of simple methods, both old and new, to help with avoidance. Remember, putting into practice any of these measures can only be helpful in managing your allergies.'""The good news is that you really don't have to strip your house down to the bare bones to make it ""'allergy''-proof. Thorough and regular cleaning generally makes a huge difference in keeping your house as ''mold'' and dust-free as possible. Patients with ''asthma'' or ''allergic rhinitis'' that are due to dust mites, molds, or other ''indoor allergens'' can feel better by taking these simple measures:''When patients get started with the process of ""''allergy''-proofing"" their homes, one of two things usually happens. They either do nothing or ""overdo it."" Some patients become so overwhelmed with all the different methods of ''allergy'""-proofing that they simply do nothing. That's always a disappointing outcome, especially when the process is so straightforward and inexpensive. Just focusing on the basics of a routine and thorough cleaning and temperature and humidity reduction can lead to fewer symptoms and a vastly improved quality of life.""""Sometimes, the opposite occurs. The allergy-proofing process becomes all-consuming and inordinately expensive. Overpriced and often inefficient whole-house filtration devices are installed when simple cleaning and reduction of humidity and temperature would have been adequate. Clearly, there are situations in which extreme measures need to be undertaken. Before going down this path, however, it's best to consult with your doctor. Start with the easy things first.""'The next section will describe the best steps to take in allergy-proofing your home. Always take a calculated approach, stepping up the process as needed for certain problems. First, we will focus on the best ways to clean and in the second part, on the available technologies.'   Keep the home cool (between 68 and 72 degrees F); Maintain a low humidity (between 40 and 50%); and Make certain there is good ventilation."
Cleaning and More Cleaning: What Really Helps?,"'If you are going to undertake to thoroughly clean your home, it is best to ensure at the beginning that the techniques being used are the most effective. The tips discussed below will help you achieve the maximum benefit for all of your efforts.''Soap & Hot Water:'' Scientific studies of patients who are ''allergic'' to dust mites have shown that taking steps to minimize ''dust mite'' allergens in the bedroom leads to a decrease in allergic symptoms and medication requirements. Emphasis is placed on the bedroom since people spend at least one-third of a 24 hour day there. It is also the room with the greatest number of dust mites.'""New synthetic bedding materials are available that are equivalent to down for warmth but can withstand washing more easily because the fibers don't clump. The ideal water temperature for washing is at least 130 degrees F to completely kill the dust mites found throughout the bedding.""'When the hot water heater is set to achieve a temperature of 130 degrees F, precautions must be taken to prevent scalding a child. For example, at bath time, always remain in the room with a child and make sure to always turn off the ""hot"" water faucet first and finish with the ""''cold''"" faucet.''The choice of bedding materials becomes important. They must be able to withstand the rigors of weekly hot water washing in order to kill the dust mites and remove accumulated allergens. Many bedding materials may be bulky, making them more difficult to wash. It may be easier to use several layers for warmth instead of bulky items for ease of washing. Since any type of blanket material can support dust ''mite'' growth, it is important to select one that can withstand repeated washings.''Vacuuming the Right Way:'"" If the carpet can't be replaced by a solid surface such as tile, linoleum, or hardwood, then it must be cleaned thoroughly and frequently. Also remember to vacuum upholstered furniture, draperies, and other fabric items that cannot be washed, removed or replaced. The trouble with vacuuming is that the allergenic dust mite and mold particles become airborne during the process. Dust mite particles can remain airborne for about 15 minutes and be redistributed throughout the home environment. Allergic persons clearly should not be doing the vacuuming and should also stay out of the area until the dust particles resettle. Dust mite particles also become airborne during bedding changes or the placement of dust covers on the mattress, box spring, and pillows. For severely allergic people, these tasks can lead to significant allergy and possible ""'asthma'' attacks. Those affected by these allergies should definitely not perform these chores.''Allergic persons should not perform vacuuming tasks and should keep out of the immediate environment for at least 1 hour after the vacuuming has been completed. Damp dusting should then follow to catch any loose particles.''The vacuum cleaner collecting bag acts as the primary filter in most vacuum cleaning systems. A standard bag can be replaced with a high-filtration multi-layer bag and an exhaust filter can be added. These measures prevent ''allergen'' particles from escaping and becoming airborne during the vacuuming process. Replacing the vacuum ''bags'' and adding exhaust filters are economical ways to increase the efficiency of an older vacuum. These bags and filters are easily obtained from allergy supply houses. The filters are available in 8"" x 10"" sheets that can be cut to size for any canister vacuum. Very expensive vacuum units with built-in HEPA systems (High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter) have been available for years. Now, more affordable brands of vacuums come equipped with HEPA filters and a removable canister that can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher. This system eliminates the problem with vacuum bags. As the older generation of vacuums is phased out, this development should be quite helpful in allergy control. Whole-house vacuum systems, although quite expensive, are also helpful because the dirt collection system is located outside the house, usually in the garage.''Dust mites, molds, animal danders, and insect debris are difficult to thoroughly clean from the environment. However, it really is easier and quicker to clean a hard surface such as wood, tile, vinyl, or leather than it is to clean all those nooks and crannies found in carpet, fabric, or other soft surfaces.''Replacing the carpet with a hard-surfaced floor can eliminate over 90% of dust mites. If you absolutely have to have carpet, get the kind that has a low pile.'""The following is a list of suggestions for how to make allergy-proofing an easier task. Hopefully, these ideas will lead to other methods you can use to thoroughly clean and maintain your environment allergy-free. Take it one step at a time and focus on the bedrooms first. If you plan on moving, pay close attention to steps that can be taken to allergy-proof prior to moving into the new house. It is much easier to put these ideas into action in the beginning than after everything is in place. It's really not as hard as it looks!""""Baby's Room - Special Tips:"""" It's a good idea to eliminate potential irritants and allergens from your baby's environment. Here's what you can do to help eliminate potential sources of allergens from your baby's world."" Avoid ornate furniture. Plain, simple designs accumulate less dust. No open bookshelves; they are great dust-catchers. Keep all clothes in drawers or closets, never lying about the room. Enclose wool clothes in plastic zipper bags. Avoid mothballs, insect sprays, tar paper, or camphor. Keep drawers and closet doors closed. Remove as much clutter as possible to make cleaning easier. Place hard-to-clean items in closets, drawers, or display cabinets with glass doors. When choosing furnishings, it is best to go with wood, leather, vinyl, or rubberized canvas furniture and avoid upholstered pieces. Upholstery easily traps allergens and is much harder to clean. You might try washable slipcovers on existing upholstered furniture. Install wood, tile, or linoleum flooring. Limit throw rugs to those that can be easily cleaned in the washer. They should be able to withstand washing weekly. Use allergen-proof encasings for pillows, mattresses, and box springs. Tape over zippers to help prevent leaks. Vacuum all casings frequently. Store nothing under the bed. Use washable cotton or synthetic blankets, not fuzzy surfaced ones. Use easily laundered cotton bedspreads or coverlets; avoid chenille. Install roll-up washable cotton or synthetic window shades. Avoid Venetian blinds, mini-blinds, and pleated shades. Use washable cotton or fiberglass curtains. Avoid draperies and decorative fabric window treatments! Install central air conditioning or window units. Keep windows closed, especially during periods of high pollen counts and windy conditions. Grasses, weeds, and trees tend to pollinate during the early morning hours. Sleep with the windows closed. Use Dacron or other synthetics for pillows. Avoid feathers or foam rubber, which traps moisture and promotes mold and dust mite growth. Space heaters are preferred over hot air ducts. In homes with forced air heat, use filters or damp cheesecloth over inlets to reduce dust circulation. Change every two weeks. Consult your physician about air purifiers. Keep beds away from air vents. Damp dusting using a dampened cloth or an oiled mop will minimize the distribution of dust through the air. Wood or plastic chairs are best for the baby's room. Again, avoid all featherbedding. Use dust-proof casings for all bedding. Stuffed animals should never be placed in the crib and, if used, should be washable. Put most of the stuffed items in a closed chest or closet. Store them in a freezer bag when not in use. When it comes to gifts for children, ask for books rather than stuffed animals. Keep the books in a bookcase with doors to help reduce allergens. Humidifiers should be reserved for croup. They should not be used routinely since they increase the dust mite and mold counts. If a humidifier is required, the cool water variety is safer than a steam humidifier in terms of burns. Also, be sure to change the water daily if a humidifier is necessary. Animal fur is a potential allergen. It's best to keep pets out of the baby's room. Overhead mobiles and wall hangings collect dust! Baby bumpers should be simple and washable. No ruffles or pleats. Ruffled curtains and Venetian blinds collect a lot of dust. Vertical blinds are preferable. If levelers or shutters are used, be sure to clean them weekly with a damp cloth. The crib should be placed away from air vents. A HEPA filter (High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter) can be placed under the crib. The filter will help to decrease airborne allergens such as pollens, mold spores, and animal danders."
What are great techniques for mold patrol?,"'Mold spores can pop up anywhere. There are lots of ways to deal with this persistent problem that is cost-effective and really work. Dealing with mold requires elbow grease, patience, and mold know-how. Do not give up; the effort is well worth it.''Allergy Alert''Greenhouses, antique shops, saunas, sleeping bags, summer cottages, and hotel rooms are sources of increased ''mold exposure''. Automobile air conditioners may harbor mold.''Numerous cleaning products specializing in mold control are available. The active ingredients in these products that are effective against molds are bleach and ammonia. So why should you pay a premium for anti-mold preparations when you can readily prepare the mixture at home for a fraction of the cost? As long as you are aware of the fabric fading effects and the potentially caustic nature of these cleaning materials, there should be no problems. Limited areas of mold collection (as occurs in the bathroom) can be cleaned with a bleach solution. An old ''toothbrush'' and bleach work wonders on the dark mildew that often collects between the tiles. If there is carpet in the bathroom (ideally there shouldn\'t be since this is a ""moisture trap"" for mold), be careful not to drip the bleach on the carpet! Regularly using a ""squeegee"" along with a bottle of diluted bleach will help keep the mold spores under control.'""Shower curtains present a special problem for mold control. Once the curtain is stained with mold spots, it might be worth a wash and rinse cycle with bleach. Usually, however, by the time you can see dime-size deposits of mold on the plastic shower curtain, it's probably not worth the effort. At this point, it would be better to purchase a vinyl curtain with a mold inhibitor. (These are available for use in motel rooms.)""""Larger areas, especially under the house, should be treated with either Orthocine, Captan's powder (8 oz in a gallon of water), or bleach (mix 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water). These products are available in hardware stores. Using rubber gloves, scrub the affected areas, and repeat the process in 2 hours.""'For even more extensive molds under the house, buy a 5 lb. bag of Bordeaux mixture (mostly copper sulfate) from any regular nursery and mix it with 15 to 20 gallons of water in a large tank sprayer. Spray the areas under the house, the ground, and all wood thoroughly at least 3 to 4 times a year for the first several years.''If the Bordeaux mixture is unavailable or does not control the problem, Ziram can be used in a 1-2% spray solution. Mix 3 ounces of the concentrate to 1 gallon of water. Ziram can also be used in the home for walls and floors. When applied to some fabrics, it may produce a slightly yellow color. Protective clothing should always be used when spraying this fungicide. One application of Ziram is usually sufficient for mold control.''Caution: DO NOT STORE FUNGICIDES NEAR FIRE OR OPEN FLAMES. ALWAYS BE SURE THERE IS GOOD VENTILATION DURING USE BECAUSE MANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES ARE TOXIC!''Farmers, gardeners, bakers, brewers, florists, carpenters, mill workers, upholsterers, and paperhangers have increased exposure to mold due to their occupations. Your allergist can offer specific recommendations for handling these work environments.' Lower the humidity level in the house. Use fans for proper ventilation. Clean visible mold from walls and ceilings. Keep firewood outside since the bark is covered with mold. Add mold inhibitor to paint before applying if it will be used in a damp environment, especially on brick and cinderblock walls in a basement or shady areas. Mold tends to grow in closets, as they tend to be dark and damp. Dry shoes and boots before storing them. Consider a chemical moisture remover (desiccant) such as calcium carbonate flakes or crystals. One brand is Dri-Out Dome, which is readily available through allergy catalogs and home improvement stores. Do not carpet the bathroom. Mold grows in refrigerators. Keep them clean and defrosted. Remove spoiled food, preferably before it gets that way! Correct seepage or flooding problems and remove the water-damaged carpet. Carpet and pad should not be laid on a concrete floor since this is a great place for moisture to accumulate, resulting in a flourishing population of dust mites and mold. Remove moldy stored items from the basement and keep it clean."
How can people with allergies ideally control the air quality and climate in their homes?,"'Controlling the air quality and climate of your home may sound daunting, but it is actually not that difficult to achieve and can lead to substantial benefits. Good maintenance of these systems can increase the benefits you will receive and prolong the life-span of these devices.''HEPA Filters:'' HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter. These devices were developed during the Apollo era of space exploration. They can filter most substances from the air, down to 0.3 microns in size. (A micron is a unit of length equivalent to 1/1000 of a millimeter.) They are helpful in filtering pollen, mold spores, animal dander, and fumes.'""HEPA filters aren't for dust mites. Dust mite allergens are heavy and fall to the ground quickly, thus avoiding being trapped by HEPA filters.""'It is important to remember that you can not filter the world. In other words, you need to run these filters with the windows closed. The size of the room also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding what size HEPA filter to purchase.''HEPA filters have become increasingly available in many discount home improvement stores. Previously, these devices had been primarily available through allergy supply companies and catalogs at a premium price. Now, you can do some comparative shopping before you buy it. Other factors to consider before buying include the required interval between changing filters, the ease of obtaining replacement filters, and warranties. One critical factor in the use of HEPA filters is the noise level generated. Many people stop operating the unit due to the ""white noise"" associated with the device. Make sure that you listen to the device before you purchase it. The good news is that the newer generation of filters is much quieter.''Another type of filter is the electrostatic filter. So far, these have not been shown to be as efficient as the HEPA filter.''An important point to make here is that HEPA filters are not the ultimate solution to the problem of indoor allergens. They can help to some degree but in no way do they replace cleaning, temperature and humidity reduction, clutter removal, and avoidance of allergens such as pet dander.''Dehumidifiers & Humidifiers:'' Remember, house mites require high humidity to thrive. Dehumidifying the air is easily accomplished with an air conditioner, but this is practical only in hot weather. The correct placement and use of fans and vents can help reduce humidity as can a dehumidifier machine. It pays to find a knowledgeable sales source that can help you determine the appropriate size machine needed for your individual home or office. Clearly, the most important point about a dehumidifier is that it must be kept scrupulously clean. Otherwise, molds will flourish in the collection chamber making your problem worse than it was in the first place. Dehumidifiers must be cleaned daily. Some models have an automatic shut off mechanisms that keep the tank from overflowing and some have a continuous drainage system.''Humidity gauges are readily available at any hardware store. A range of 40-50% humidity is good. Humidity lower than 35% can make ''breathing'' uncomfortable for some people with ''asthma'' or other respiratory conditions. Generally speaking, low humidity is not the health problem that high humidity can be.''Humidifiers are rarely needed except for children with ''croup''. In most parts of the country, the humidity seldom drops below 35% and the nostrils and airways provide natural moisture. However, it is true that in certain parts of the country, a well-heated home can become overly dry.''Croup is a viral infection in small children that is characterized by a harsh, barking ''cough''. The condition is frequently worse at night. One of the recommended treatments is mist or steam, which is best provided by a cool air humidifier. Vaporizers should be avoided due to the risk of ''burns''.''As previously noted, some central hot-air systems may include built-in humidifiers that can make the air more comfortable to breathe. However, there are definite problems with this type of system. Not only can these units blow mold spores and dust all through the air, but keeping these systems mold and bacteria-free is extremely difficult.''Stand-alone humidifiers are available and are frequently used in homes with antiques or fine art that could be damaged from excessive dryness. They are often recommended for people with respiratory problems and ''eczema'', which can be worsened by dryness. The truth is, though, that humidifiers tend to cause more problems than they solve. They should be used only sparingly, as their health benefits are primarily limited to infants or young children with croup.''The most frequently used stand-alone unit is the evaporative humidifier. This system uses a wick or pad to absorb water from a reservoir. A fan then disperses the water vapor through the air. This method can cause bacterial counts in the air to skyrocket, leading to ""humidifier ''fever'',"" a ''flu-like'' infection of the respiratory tract.''Although ultrasonic humidifiers kill the bacteria, they also spray parts of the dead microorganisms into the air along with ''minerals'"" that then deposit on surfaces throughout homes. Fine white dust on furniture evidence these mineral deposits. Generally, the ultrasonic models are no longer distributed but these devices are kept for years, so be sure to check what type of model you might own. A newer type of device is a vibratory humidifier that doesn't cause mineral deposits. All humidifiers should be used sparingly and MUST be cleaned after each use to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria and mold spores. Just by lowering the temperature of the home during the winter, the air will contain more moisture and the need for humidifiers will be minimized.""'Air Conditioning & Heating Systems:'' Air conditioners are critical in filtering summertime air for patients allergic to molds and pollens. They also function as excellent dehumidifiers, thus limiting the growth of dust mites and molds. Another unexpected benefit is that the airflow discourages cockroaches since they prefer non-ventilated spaces.''Filters on both central and window units require frequent changing and or cleaning to remain efficient and prevent mold growth.''Separate room or area filtration units are more effective than whole house filtration units that are installed on central air systems. Claims that an entire house can be adequately filtered with just one unit are false. A HEPA filter can only cover a certain number of cubic ''feet'' and separate units need to be installed throughout the system.''Central air-conditioning and heating systems may also come with electrostatic filters that catch smaller particles than regular filters. The filters charge the particles in the air as they pass through the filter. The charged particles are then trapped by an oppositely charged plate in the unit. These devices must be cleaned frequently as well.''A concern about electrostatic filters has been ozone production, which can make asthma worse. This hazard has been reduced by the addition of charcoal filters.''Unfortunately, it is not clear whether the special filters available for home heating and air-conditioning units are completely effective. Be sure to inquire about the particle size that the filter is guaranteed to trap. A minimum of 5 microns is recommended. At this point, it appears that of the two options, HEPA filtration is superior.''Another option is the placement of individual filters over the outlet ducts themselves. These filters should be cleaned weekly and replaced as necessary. They are readily available from most allergy supply stores and catalogs and home hardware stores.'""Some forced-air heating systems come with built-in humidifiers. This feature can backfire because dust particles are stirred up by the hot air and mold can flourish in the humidifier itself. Cleaning these units is of the utmost importance, but this can be a cumbersome task. If mold is a problem, it's probably best to have the humidifier removed.""'Options apart from forced air systems include space heaters and radiant-heat systems. These two methods of heating are advantageous in that allergens and irritants are not distributed throughout the home environment as they are with forced air systems.' "
How can dust covers help?,"'People with allergies to dust mites and molds are well served by encasing their pillows, mattress, and box springs in zippered, allergen-impermeable encasings. These covers provide the patient with a protective barrier against dust mites, their fecal particles, and mold antigens. This is critical in reducing your dust mite exposure, especially if you take into account that most people spend at least one-third of each day in the bedroom. The bedroom is also a haven for dust mites due to its warmth and humidity and to the abundant food source from human skin flakes and secretions.''Formerly, dust covers were only available in plastic. Fortunately, the technology has improved to the point that the newer fabrics allow airflow but completely prevent the passage of antigens through the impermeable fibers. The flow of air and ''perspiration'' through the fabric provides excellent comfort without the clammy feel associated with plastic. These products are increasingly available through various allergy catalogs, allergy supply houses, home supply stores, and an ever-increasing number of online computer sites. Grocery store chains are increasingly carrying these products as awareness of their effectiveness has grown. Be sure to examine the samples available so you will be comfortable with your product choice. There is a range of prices for these products, so be sure to compare them. Your allergist will typically have an array of catalogs and order forms to assist you in your search.'""When people invest in dust covers, they sometimes omit the purchase of the box spring cover in an effort to economize. Since the body is not in direct contact with the box spring, people might think it is not important enough to bother with it. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Several years ago, a study compared the dust mite counts of beds with partial versus complete coverings. It was quite clear that unless all parts are covered, the entire bed becomes reinfested with dust mites in a short period of time. The good news is that you can use a less expensive vinyl cover on the box spring since it does not touch the skin. The investment in complete dust covers is well worth the money.""""Researchers in Spain recently found that children sleeping in the bottom and top bunks of bunk beds were equally likely to develop an allergy to dust mites. However, the child sleeping on the bottom bunk was at a significantly higher risk of developing asthma than the child on the top bunk. It may be that the health aspects of bunking together should be considered when planning children's room designs, especially for families with asthma and allergy histories."" "
What are carpet powders? Can they help?,"""By this point, we all know how important it is to remove the carpets, especially in the bedroom. Sometimes though, this just is not practical. Perhaps you are renting your home or apartment or maybe you just had the carpet replaced before you became aware of your dust mite allergy. Don't worry, there are ways around this.""""One option is tannic acid (3% solution). Although the acid doesn't kill the dust mites, it does destroy the mite allergens. The solution can be easily sprayed on troublesome surfaces and is fast-acting. It may, however, cause staining of carpets and upholstery. On a positive note, tannic acid may inactivate cat allergens, but this requires a frequent application. Unfortunately, tannic acid has a temporary effect at best.""'Another option is an ""acaracide,"" which comes as a powder or spray that actually kills the dust mites and decreases the antigen levels. This product is available through allergy supply companies but remains unavailable in Canada.''The presence of a smoker in the home will sabotage the best of all possible treatment programs for allergies and asthma. If you, your spouse or partner, or your child has chronic allergies or asthma problems, '""don't smoke"""" and don't allow ""'smoking'' in the home. ''Smoking'' may be the reason why allergy and ''asthma symptoms'' are persisting despite an otherwise thorough allergy control and medication treatment program. Children who are exposed to ''cigarette'' smoke are at a 21% increased risk of developing asthma. There are no excuses and ""''smoking'' outside"" is not good enough. If you smoke, quit now. It\'s terrible for you and for everyone who lives with you.' "
What to do with the pets?,"'This is frequently a challenging issue for both doctors and allergy sufferers. Common sense and emotion often collide and differences of opinion amongst family members may complicate the problem. In order of their effectiveness, the recommended control measures for a significantly allergic or ''asthmatic'' individual are:''Even after you have found a new home for your pet, animal allergens may still persist in your home for many months in the typical reservoirs, carpeting, upholstery, and mattresses. Repeated vacuuming, steam cleaning, and applications of a 3% tannic acid solution will help neutralize the remaining allergens.''If parting with your pet is unacceptable, the following are additional tips for managing the home environment.''Kittens take to regular bathing better than do older cats. Start slowly with a few drops of tepid water (soap is not necessary) on its fur and then progress to a full rinse. Reward the cat with treats - this might help.' Find another home for the pet. Keep the pet outdoors at all times. Remember, though, that the allergens will come into your home on your clothes. Keep the pet out of the allergic person's bedroom at all times. When the pet is indoors, keep it in a room with few allergy reservoirs, such as the kitchen. Provide your cat or dog with its own bed. Use a HEPA filter in the bedroom and a portable room heater if needed. Seal off the room air ducts. Wear a mask when handling the litter box, or even better, have a non-allergic family member do it. Vacuum with a double filter or a HEPA filter. Wash the cat weekly to help remove surface allergens."
What do I do with those ghastly cockroaches?,"'The elimination of cockroaches is best accomplished by using a professional exterminator. However, this is only the first step. After the cockroaches have been eliminated, the areas they inhabited must be thoroughly cleaned since their residual debris is highly allergenic. Entry points should be sealed to prevent re-infestation. Use covered trash bins and empty them frequently. Do not store cardboard boxes, newspapers, grocery bags, or empty cans and bottles in your home as they can serve as breeding areas.'

Facts you should know about stinging insect allergies," Severity of reactions to stings varies greatly. Most insect stings do not produce allergic reactions. Anaphylactic reactions are the most serious reactions and can be fatal. Anaphylactic reactions can cause swelling of the tongue, hoarseness, difficulty breathing, and loss of consciousness. Itching, hives, skin flushing, and tingling or itching inside the mouth are typical signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to insect stings. Avoidance and prompt treatment are essential. Allergists are physicians specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. Epinephrine (available in portable, self-injectable form) is the treatment of choice for anaphylactic reactions. In selected people, allergy injection therapy is highly effective in preventing future reactions. The three ""A's"" of insect allergy are adrenaline, avoidance, and allergist."
What are stinging insects?,"'Stinging insects found in the United States include honeybees, yellow jackets, hornets, wasps, and fire ants. While not everyone is allergic to insect venom, reactions in the skin such as mild ''pain'', swelling, and redness may occur with an ''insect sting''.' "
What types of insect sting reactions occur?,"'Most insect-sting reactions are not allergic and result in local ''pain'', itching, swelling, and redness at the site of the sting. Some extension of the swelling is expected. Local treatment is usually all that is needed for this type of reaction. Disinfect the area, keep it clean, and apply ice. Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams are sometimes used to decrease inflammation, and ''antihistamines'' can help control itching.''Large local reactions may involve increased swelling (that lasts for 48 hours up to one week) that may be accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Large local reactions occur in about 10% of insect stings and are not allergic in origin. Occasionally, the site of an ''insect sting'' will become infected, and antibiotics are needed.''Systemic (body-wide) reactions are allergic responses and occur in people who have developed antibodies against the insect venom from a prior exposure. It is estimated that between 0.3%-3% of stings trigger a systemic allergic reaction.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of insect sting allergies?,"'The allergic reaction to an insect sting varies from person to person. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include itching, hives, flushing of the skin, tingling or itching inside the mouth, and ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. The most serious allergic reaction is called ''anaphylaxis'', which can be fatal. Difficulty breathing, swallowing, ''hoarseness'', swelling of the tongue, ''dizziness'', and ''fainting'' are signs of a ''severe allergic reaction''. These types of reactions usually occur within minutes of the sting but have been known to be delayed for up to 24 hours. Prompt treatment is essential, and emergency help is often needed.' "
Who is at risk for insect sting allergies?,"'Over 2 million Americans are allergic to stinging insects. The degree of ''allergy'' varies widely. Most people are not allergic to insect stings, and most insect stings result in only local itching and swelling. Many, however, will have severe allergic reactions. Severe allergic reactions to insect stings are responsible for at least 50 deaths each year in the U.S.''If you are known to be allergic to insect stings, then the next sting is more likely to be similar or worse than the previous sting. Since most stings occur in the summer and fall, you are at greatest risk during these months. Males under the age of 20 are the most common victims of serious insect-sting allergic reactions, but this may reflect a greater exposure to insects of males, rather than a true predisposition.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose an insect sting allergy?,"'In a person with a known ''insect sting allergy'', the presence of the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction following a sting or bite is typically sufficient to establish the diagnosis of an allergic reaction.''A person who is unsure whether or not they have an allergy to stinging insects can consult an allergist/immunologist physician for testing. Two types of tests, skin tests and blood tests, can be used to determine whether or not you have an allergy to specific types of stinging insects. Skin testing involves placing a sample of the insect venom on or slightly under the top level of skin and observing the area for signs of an allergic reaction. Blood testing involves a test called a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) to determine the amount of IgE antibodies in your blood to a specific substance.' "
What specialists treat insect sting allergies?,"'Allergy specialists and immunologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing ''allergies'' and prescribing allergy injection therapy for stinging-insect allergy (see below). The actual allergic reaction itself may be treated by emergency-medicine or primary-care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, or family practitioners.' "
What is the treatment for a severe allergic reaction? What's the best way to remove a stinger?,"""Honeybee stingers are barbed stingers that are left behind in the person's skin after the initial sting. If the stinger is removed by pinching the stinger, more venom is actually injected into the skin. It is better to remove the stinger by gently lifting the stinger using a fingernail or knife edge to flick the stinger out of the skin. Other stinging insects do not leave stingers behind and this technique does not apply.""'An allergic reaction is treated with epinephrine (adrenaline). Several self-injectable devices are available by prescription, including ''EpiPen'', ''Auvi-Q'', and others. These devices are filled with the epinephrine to be injected in to the subcutaneous tissue or muscle, preferably into the front of the thigh. These self-injected devices usually contain only one dose and, on occasion, more than one dose is needed. Venom extractors are commercially available, but they have not been demonstrated to have any benefit.''If a serious sting reaction occurs, always seek medical attention, even if epinephrine is used and all seems stable. The allergic reaction can subsequently progress and become more serious after epinephrine has worn off. Sometimes epinephrine is not enough and intravenous fluids or other treatment is needed. If you are known to be seriously allergic to insects, you must remember to carry the epinephrine at all times especially when out of reach of medical care (such as in the woods or even on an airplane). If epinephrine is not available when you are stung, contact a doctor as soon as possible. In addition to epinephrine, an oral dose of ''antihistamine'' (like ''diphenhydramine'' [''Benadryl'']) can reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction. Antihistamines take effect in about one hour. Ultimately, however, it is crucial to attempt to avoid the sting.'  "
Are there home remedies for insect sting allergies?,"'There are no home remedies that can prevent an allergic reaction or treat a severe reaction such as anaphylaxis. You can take steps to relieve the symptoms of a mild allergic reaction, including' taking an oral antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or using a topical steroid cream, applying cold compresses to the affected area, and cleaning the area with soap and water to prevent secondary infection."
How can I avoid insect stings?,"'Obviously, the best treatment is avoiding the insect sting. Certain precautionary measures will greatly decrease your chances of being stung. Honeybees are not aggressive and will usually not sting unless disturbed or injured. The majority of honeybee stings are on the bottom of the bare foot while stepping on the bee. Avoid ''walking'' barefoot on lawns where honeybees or other stinging insects may be present. Yellow jackets nest in the ground and in walls. Caution should be used with unusual forms in walls and mounds in the ground. Hornets and wasps often nest in bushes, in trees, and under roofs. Use caution too in these areas and in selecting employment requiring exposure to these conditions.''Bright colors attract insects seeking nectar. Stinging insects are attracted to food and strong smells. Avoid open food in garbage cans, dumps, and open picnic areas. Do not wear perfumes, hair sprays, and colognes. Keep the body covered as much as possible with light-colored clothing. Insect repellents are not effective against stinging insects.' "
What can I do about becoming immune to insect allergy?,"'All people who have had a significant reaction to a stinging insect should be evaluated by an allergy specialist for possible venom immunotherapy (''allergy shots'' that develop an immunity to insect allergy). Selected patients with significant sensitivity to insect venom and specific symptoms can undergo allergy injection therapy for stinging-insect allergy. ''Allergy immunotherapy'' against stinging insects in these selected patients is almost 100% effective.''This type of treatment usually involves a gradually increasing dose of the venom over 10-20 weeks. Then a ""maintenance"" dosage every four to eight weeks is given. After approximately three to five years, discontinuation of the venom shot is considered. Therapy for three to five years confers long-term protection in most people. The risk of severe adverse reactions from this venom therapy is minimal (less than 0.2%), and no deaths have been reported to date.''The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends the following:' Avoid disturbing likely beehive sites, such as large trees, tree stumps, logs, and large rocks. If a colony is disturbed, run and find cover as soon as possible. Running in a zigzag pattern may be helpful. Never stand still or crawl into a hole or other space with no way out. Do not slap at the bees. Cover as much of the head and face as possible, without obscuring vision, while running. Once clear of the bees, remove stingers and seek medical care if necessary, especially if there is a history of allergy to bee venom."
What is the prognosis for an insect sting allergy?,'Most people recover from allergic reactions to insect stings without further complications. Those who have a history of severe reactions or anaphylaxis should always carry a self-injecting epinephrine source. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) for insect sting allergy as a treatment choice has an excellent outcome for certain people with insect sting allergy.' 
What is latex and where is it found?,"'Latex is a natural product which comes from the light milky fluid extracted from the rubber tree. This milky fluid is often modified during the manufacturing process to form a latex mixture. A person can be allergic to the latex or the mixture or both. Latex-containing products are many and varied (see the list below). Common household latex products include balloons and ''condoms''. Common medical latex products include stoppers on syringes, ''blood pressure'' cuffs, oxygen tubing, and catheters. The powder of surgical gloves was a significant problem before appropriate substitutes were developed, as the powder could be inhaled and could lead to respiratory difficulties.' "
What caused the rise in latex allergies?,"'In the 1980s, with the emergence of the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), it became increasingly important to take precautions that would prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This effort resulted in the application of universal precautions for protecting a person from infectious material, such as blood and other bodily fluids, using protective barriers. The most commonly used barrier was the latex glove. The prevalence of latex ''allergy'' peaked at 3%-9.5% in the 1990s but now has fallen to less than 1% in countries where active latex avoidance measures are practiced.' "
Who is at risk for developing a latex allergy?,"'Repeated exposure to latex is necessary for an allergy to develop. Health-care workers exposed to latex products (such as gloves and catheters), people who require frequent surgery or catheter use, and workers in the manufacturing or distribution of latex products are at the highest risk for latex allergy. For unknown reasons, people who have surgeries of the spine or urinary tract have a much higher risk of latex allergy.''There is also an association of unique ''food allergy'' among people allergic to latex, known as the fruit latex syndrome. People allergic to latex are frequently allergic to various fruits, particularly avocado, banana, chestnut, and kiwi.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of the two forms of latex allergy?,"'Allergy to latex comes in two different forms. One form is called a ""delayed hypersensitivity,"" which is usually seen as an ''itchy'' skin ''rash'' at the site where the latex product contacts the skin. This ''rash'' is similar to ''poison ivy'' and is generally self-limited. The other form is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (also known as an IgE-mediated reaction) to latex. This type of reaction can lead to ''anaphylaxis'', a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can involve the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and ''cardiovascular system''.' "
How do health-care professionals assess and diagnose a latex allergy?,"'Clinical history is the most important aspect of diagnosing any type of latex allergy. A patch test to latex could potentially be performed to diagnose a delayed hypersensitivity response to latex. For an immediate hypersensitivity response to latex, a blood test is the only approved test presently available. In the United States, there is currently no approved skin testing for an immediate hypersensitivity to latex.' "
What is the treatment for a latex allergy?,"'Strict avoidance of latex is the treatment for latex allergy. Latex-free synthetic rubber, such as neoprene, nitrile, SBR, Butyl, and Vitron are polymers available as alternatives to natural rubber. Certain individuals at risk for anaphylaxis may benefit from having an epinephrine autoinjector on hand at all times.''No current treatment is available to desensitize a person who is allergic to latex. For a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to latex, topical or oral steroids may be used to treat the rash. An anaphylactic reaction to latex should be treated promptly with injectable epinephrine, and mild reactions confined to the skin may be treated with oral ''antihistamines''.' "

"What are poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac?","'Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac (belonging to the ''Anacardiaceae'' family) are plants that can cause a rash if individuals come in contact with the oily resin found in them.''Poison ivy'' (''Toxicodendron radicans'' -- eastern poison ivy/''Toxicodendron rydbergii'' -- western poison ivy) typically grows as a vine or shrub, and it can be found throughout much of North America (except in the desert, Alaska, and Hawaii). It grows in open fields, wooded areas, on the roadside, and along riverbanks. It can also be found in urban areas, such as parks or backyards. Poison ivy plants typically have leaf arrangements that are clustered in groups of three leaflets (trifoiate), though this can vary. The color and shape of the leaves may also vary depending upon the exact species, the local environment, and the time of year. The plant may have yellow or green flowers, and white to green-yellow berries, depending on the season. Eastern poison ivy typically grows as a hairy ropelike vine, whereas western poison ivy tends to grow as a low shrub.''Poison oak'' (''Toxicodendron diversilobum'') grows as a vine or shrub, and it is found in the western United States and British Columbia. It also has a leaf arrangement similar to poison ivy, with clusters of three leaflets. The leaves may sometimes resemble true oak leaves.''Poison sumac'' (''Toxicodendron vernix'') grows as a shrub or small tree, and it is found in the eastern/southeastern United States. It grows in very wet areas, and it can be found along the banks of the Mississippi River. Each stem contains seven to 13 leaves arranged in pairs. It has the potential to cause a more severe rash than either poison ivy or poison oak.'

"What causes a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Exposure to all of these plants can produce a rash, which is caused by sensitivity to an oily resin found in these plants called urushiol. This substance can be found on the leaves, stems, flowers, and roots of these plants. Interestingly, it can remain active even after the plant has died. Exposure to even very small amounts of urushiol, amounts less than a grain of table salt, will lead to the development of a rash in 80%-90% of individuals.''The rash (an ''allergic contact dermatitis'"") can be caused by direct contact with urushiol by touching the plants or by indirect contact with the plant oil that may have contaminated a pet's fur, tools, clothing, or other surfaces. Airborne contact is also possible if these plants are burned and the urushiol particles land on the skin, and it can affect the ""'lungs'' as well if the urushiol is inhaled. In the United States, ''Toxicodendron'' ''dermatitis'' is the most common cause of ''contact dermatitis''.''Sensitivity to urushiol occurs when individuals come into contact with it. The first time a person is exposed, they may not develop a rash. However, with repeated exposure, sensitivity develops that ultimately leads to the development of the characteristic rash. Most people (about 85%) will develop sensitivity, while a small percentage of individuals (about 15%) never develop an ''allergic reaction'' to urushiol.' "
"What are risk factors for poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Any individual who comes into contact with these plants is at risk for developing the rash. However, people who spend more time outdoors in geographic areas where these plants are known to grow are at higher risk. This may include certain occupations associated with outdoor work in these areas, such as gardeners, groundskeepers, farmers, forestry workers, and construction workers. Hiking enthusiasts may also be at higher risk if they venture into areas where these plants are present.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'Susceptible people will develop the characteristic rash after exposure to the urushiol from these plants, typically within 12-72 hours after the initial contact. The signs and symptoms can include the following:'""The rash may appear bumpy, streaky, linear, or patchy, and it will affect the areas that have come into contact with the oil resin. Areas that have been exposed to a larger amount of urushiol may develop the rash more quickly, and the rash may appear more severe. In some instances, new lesions may continue to appear for up to two to three weeks. One can spread the rash to other parts of the body if one's contaminated hands (with the oil resin) touch other areas. The fluid that sometimes oozes from the blisters does not contain urushiol and therefore does not spread the rash, and other individuals who touch this fluid will not develop the rash. In order to spread the rash to someone else, they must directly come into contact with the oil resin. Generally speaking, the rash slowly improves and disappears after one to three weeks in most individuals. Overall, the symptoms may range from mild to severe. Rarely, in extreme cases, an anaphylactic reaction can develop.""'If these plants are burned, the airborne particles of urushiol can be inhaled, causing respiratory difficulty from irritation of the lungs. Occasionally, this reaction can be severe.'

"What types of doctors treat poison ivy, oak, and sumac rash?","'The rash produced by exposure to ''poison ivy, oak, and sumac'' is generally treated by a primary-care physician, including family physicians, internists, and pediatricians. In cases where the diagnosis is not clear, a dermatologist may be consulted.' "
"How do physicians diagnose poison ivy, oak, and sumac rashes?","'The diagnosis of this rash is typically made by a health-care professional after obtaining a thorough history and performing a detailed exam of the skin. While some individuals will know and report exposure to poison ivy, oak, or sumac, others may not be aware of it and may not recall any exposure. The appearance of the characteristic rash is usually all that is needed to make the diagnosis. No blood tests or imaging studies are necessary.' "
"What is the treatment for a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'The initial treatment for someone who has recently been exposed to any of these plants includes rinsing the affected area with copious amounts of warm water within 20-30 minutes of exposure to remove the oily plant resin. The effectiveness of rinsing decreases with the passage of time, as the oily plant resin is quickly absorbed into the skin. Some authorities recommend rinsing with rubbing ''alcohol'', commercially available poisonous plant washes, or degreasing soaps and detergents. It is also important to scrub under the fingernails to remove any remnants of the plant resin. In addition, thoroughly clean clothing or any objects that may have come into contact with these plants.''If the characteristic rash develops, initial treatment consists of symptomatic care, as in most cases, the rash will improve on its own after one to three weeks. Self-care at home is usually all that is necessary. In the meantime, the following treatments may be useful to alleviate symptoms:' 

Read Doctor's View
   Apply cool compresses to the skin. Use topical treatments to relieve itching, including calamine lotion, oatmeal baths, Tecnu, Zanfel, or aluminum acetate (Domeboro solution). Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can also help relieve itching. For a more severe rash, a health-care professional may prescribe a high-potency steroid cream or an oral corticosteroid (such as prednisone). Over-the-counter pain medication may be necessary for pain control. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the rash becomes infected. Avoid scratching the rash to prevent the development of a bacterial infection. Go to the nearest emergency department or call an ambulance if experiencing an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) characterized by difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, facial swelling, or if one has had a previous severe reaction to these plants. Also seek medical care if the rash involves the genitals or the face or if the rash shows signs of infection."
"Are there any home remedies for a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'As above, in the majority of cases, the symptoms can be controlled at home with the aforementioned medications/formulations until the rash resolves. Though different herbal folk remedies have been used in the past, no definite effective therapy can be recommended at this time.'  "
"What is the prognosis of a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'In general, the prognosis is excellent. In the vast majority of cases, the rash will improve on its own within one to three weeks without any complications, and all that is necessary is self-care at home with treatment to relieve the itching.' "
"Is it possible to prevent a poison ivy, oak, or sumac rash?","'There are measures that can be taken to help prevent the rash caused by exposure to these plants, including the following:'   Learn to recognize these plants in order to avoid contact with them. Wear protective clothing that covers the skin, including gloves, long sleeves, long pants, and boots if in a high-risk area. If the possibility of contact with these plants exists, apply commercially available barrier creams to the skin, which may help prevent or lessen the exposure to the toxic plant oils. These products usually contain bentoquatam (IvyBlock) and should be applied before going outdoors. Do not burn these plants, as this can release urushiol into the air. Carefully remove these plants if they are growing near one's home. Be sure to wear protective clothing and gloves. Thoroughly wash clothing or any other objects that may have come into contact with these plants, as they can retain the plant oil and cause a rash if worn or touched. If a pet has been exposed to these plants, wear protective gloves and give them a bath."
"What are the causes, symptoms, and signs of common types of noninfectious rashes?","'Some common, noninfectious rashes are listed and described on the following pages. If you have a new rash and you have a ''fever'' or some other generalized illness associated with it, it would be best to see your doctor.\xa0\xa0'   Atopic dermatitis Seborrheic dermatitis Contact dermatitis Diaper rash Stasis dermatitis Psoriasis Hives Nummular eczema Drug eruptions Heat rash (miliaria) COVID-19 coronavirus rashes See a slideshow of pictures showing common skin rashes and conditions"
COVID-19 coronavirus rashes,"'Skin rashes are now being associated with coronavirus ''COVID-19'' infections. Similar to other viral diseases such as ''HIV'' and bacterial diseases like ''syphilis'', COVID-19 rashes can take many different forms. One study from Spain identified five different patterns of COVID-19 rash. The most common type was a ""macropapular rash."" These rashes feature both small, flat discolorations (""macules"") and small, elevated lesions (""papule""). These rashes are associated with more severe COVID-19 infection, as 2% of those who got them in the Spain study reportedly died from the illness. Other rashes associated with COVID-19 include thickened lesions developing on the heels of the ''feet'', lesions that resemble ''chickenpox'', and rashes that resemble those seen with ''dengue fever''.''Some dermatologists have reported cases of so-called ""COVID toe"" in both adults and children. These lesions may be reddish, elevated lesions that flatten after about a week. Some of the patients found their COVID toe rashes ''itchy'', and others did not. Some found it painful when their toes were pressed, and others did not. More research is needed, as some of the rashes reported in COVID-19 patients resemble drug reactions. For safety reasons, researchers have been unable to determine if ''drug interactions'' are responsible in these cases, or whether the novel coronavirus itself causes these rashes.' "
Atopic dermatitis,"'Atopic dermatitis'', often called ''eczema'', is a common disorder of childhood that produces red ''itchy'', weeping rashes on the inner aspects of the elbows and in back of the knees as well as the cheeks, neck, wrists, and ankles. It is commonly found in patients who also have ''asthma'' and/or ''hay fever''.' "
Seborrheic dermatitis,"'Seborrheic dermatitis is the single most common rash affecting adults. It produces a red scaling often itchy eruption that characteristically affects the ''scalp'', forehead, brows, cheeks, and external ears. In infants, it may involve and scalp (''cradle cap'') and ''diaper'' area.' "
Contact dermatitis,"'Contact dermatitis is a rash that is brought on either by contact with a specific chemical to which the patient is uniquely ''allergic'' or with a substance that directly irritates the skin. Some chemicals are both irritants and allergens. This rash tends to be weepy and oozy and affects the parts of the skin which have come in direct contact with the offending substance. Common examples of ''allergic contact dermatitis'' are ''poison ivy'', ''poison sumac'', ''poison oak'' (same chemical, different plant) and reactions to costume jewelry containing nickel.' "
Diaper rash,'This is a common type of ''irritant contact dermatitis'' that occurs in most infants and some adults who wear diapers when feces and urine are in contact with skin for too long.' 
Stasis dermatitis,"'This is a weepy, oozy dermatitis that occurs on the lower legs of individuals who have chronic swelling because of poor circulation in veins.' "
Psoriasis,"'This bumpy scaling eruption which does not weep or ooze. ''Psoriasis'' tends to occur on the scalp, elbows, and knees. The skin condition produces silvery flakes of skin that scale and fall off.' "
Hives,"'These red itchy ''bumps'' come on in a sudden fashion and then resolve in about eight hours. They tend to recur frequently. If hives are caused by a drug, that drug should be avoided in the future.' "
Nummular eczema,"'This is a weepy, oozy dermatitis that tends to occur as coin-shaped plaques in the wintertime and is associated with very ''dry skin''.' "
Drug eruptions,"'Certain ''drugs'' (like antibiotics) can produce a skin rash as an unwanted side effect. The common appearance is similar to rashes produced by certain common viral infections. On the other hand, drugs may produce a wide variety of other types of rashes.' "
Heat rash (miliaria),"'This skin eruption is caused by the occlusion of sweat ducts during hot, humid weather. It can occur at any age but is most common in infants who are kept too warm. ''Heat rash'' looks like a red cluster of ''acne'' or small ''blisters''. It is more likely to occur on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in elbow creases. Treatment involves moving the individual to a cooler environment.''Rashes not caused by infectious organisms, can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' 1% hydrocortisone cream for a week or so prior to seeking medical attention. Over-the-counter oral ''antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') or ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril'', Atarax) can be helpful in controlling the ''itching'' sensation.' "
What health care professionals diagnose and treat rashes?,"'Dermatologists, pediatricians, infectious diseases specialists, and many internists are capable of identifying most rashes.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose common skin rashes?,"'The term ''rash'' has no precise meaning but often is used to refer to a wide variety of red skin eruptions. A rash is any inflammatory condition of the skin. Dermatologists have developed various terms to describe skin rashes. The first requirement is to identify a primary, most frequent feature. The configuration of the rash is then described using adjectives such as ""circular,"" ""ring-shaped,"" ""linear,"" and ""snake-like."" Other characteristics of the rash that are noted include density, color, size, consistency, tenderness, shape, and even temperature. Finally, the distribution of the rash on the body can be very useful in diagnosis since many skin diseases have a predilection to appear in certain body areas. Although certain findings may be a very dramatic component of the skin disorder, they may be of limited value in producing an accurate diagnosis. These include findings such as ulcers, scaling, and scabbing. Using this framework, it is often possible to develop a list, called a differential diagnosis, of the possible diseases to be considered. An accurate diagnosis of a skin rash often requires a doctor or other health care professional. On the basis of the differential diagnosis, specific laboratory tests and procedures can be conducted to identify the cause of a particular rash.'  "
Rashes produced by fungal infections,"'Fungal infections'' are fairly common. Yeasts are botanically related to fungi and can cause skin rashes. These tend to affect folds of skin (like the skin under the breasts or the groin). They look fiery red and have pustules (blisters) around the edges.''Fungus and yeast infections have little to do with hygiene -- clean people get them, as well. Fungal rashes are not commonly acquired from ''dogs'' or other animals. They seem to be most easily acquired in gyms, showers, pools, or locker rooms, or from other family members. Many effective antifungal creams can be bought at the drugstore without a prescription, including 1% ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin, Mycelex) and 1% ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil''). With extensive infection, or when toenails are involved, a prescription drug may be useful, such as oral terbinafine.''If a fungus has been repeatedly treated without success, it is worthwhile considering the possibility that it was never really a fungus to start with but rather a form of ''eczema''. ''Eczema'' is treated entirely differently. A fungal infection can be independently confirmed by performing a variety of simple tests.' "
Rashes produced by bacterial infections,"'The most common ''bacterial infections'' of the skin are ''folliculitis'' and ''impetigo''. ''Staph'' or ''strep'' germs may cause ''folliculitis'' and/or ''impetigo'', two conditions that are much more common in children than adults. Eruptions caused by bacteria are often pustular (the bumps are topped by pus) or may be plaque-like and quite painful (such as with ''cellulitis''). Rarely, streptococcal ''sore throat'' can produce ''scarlet fever'', a rash affecting large areas of skin. Rashes produced by certain classes of bacteria, ''Rickettsia'' or spirochetes, ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', and secondary ''syphilis'' respectively, are often able to be suspected clinically.' "
Rash due to parasites,"'One of the most common rashes from a parasite infection is ''scabies''. ''Scabies'' is produced by a small ''mite'' (related to a spider). This mite is usually contracted by prolonged contact with another infected individual. The mite lives in the superficial layers of human skin. It does not produce symptoms until the host becomes allergic to it, which occurs about three weeks after the initial infection. It can resemble eczema. ''Bedbugs'' cause a series of eruptions where they pierce the skin.' "
Viral exanthems,"'Rashes that characteristically occur as part of certain viral infections are called exanthems. Many rashes from ''viruses'' are more often symmetrical and affect the skin surface all over the body, including ''roseola'' and ''measles''. Sometimes certain viral rashes are localized to the cheeks, such as parvovirus infections (''fifth disease''). Other viral infections, including ''herpes'' or ''shingles'', are mostly localized to one part of the body. Patients with such rashes may or may not have other symptoms like ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', localized burning, or stomach upset (''nausea''). Viral rashes usually last a few days to two weeks and resolve on their own.' "
What is the treatment for a rash?,"'Most rashes are not dangerous. Many rashes last a while and get better on their own. It is therefore not unreasonable to treat symptoms like itchy and/or ''dry skin'' for a few days to see whether the condition gets milder and goes away.''Nonprescription (over-the-counter) remedies include the following:''If these measures do not help, or if the rash persists or becomes more widespread, a consultation with a general physician or dermatologist is advisable.''There are many, many other types of rashes that we have not covered in this article. So, it is especially important, if you have any questions about the cause or medical treatment of a rash, to contact your doctor. This article, as the title indicates, is just an introduction to common skin rashes.''People with ''atopic dermatitis'' or eczema should not be vaccinated against ''smallpox'', whether or not the condition is active. Patients with ''atopic dermatitis'' are more susceptible to having the virus spread on their skin, which can lead to a serious, even life-threatening condition called ''eczema vaccinatum''. In the case of other rashes, the risk of medical complications is much less. Consult your doctor about the ''smallpox vaccine''.'   Anti-itch creams containing 1% hydrocortisone cream can be effective Oral antihistamines like diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine can be helpful in controlling the itching. Moisturizing lotions Fungal infections are best treated with topical antifungal medications that contain clotrimazole (Lotrimin), miconazole (Micatin), or terbinafine (Lamisil)."
What is the prognosis for a rash?,"'The prognosis depends on the cause of the rash. An accurate identification is, therefore, of great importance in predicting its resolution.' "
Is it possible to prevent rashes?,"'If the cause of a particular rash is known it can be avoided. For example: a ''measles'' vaccination would be of great benefit in preventing the rash of measles, as well more serious consequences of measles infections.' "
How Often Are Allergy Shots Given?,"'Allergy'' shots are given regularly (in the upper arm), with gradually increasing doses. When starting immunotherapy, you will need to go to your healthcare provider once or twice a week for several months. The dose is increased each time until the maintenance dose is reached. If the shots are effective, you will go to your healthcare provider every 2 to 4 weeks for 2 to 5 more years. You may become less sensitive to allergens during this time, and your ''allergy symptoms'' will become milder and may even go away completely. ' "
How Should I Prepare for Allergy Shots?,"'For two hours before and after your appointment, do not ''exercise'' or engage in vigorous activity. ''Exercise'' may stimulate increased blood flow to the tissues and promote faster release of antigens into the bloodstream. ''Tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking. Some medications, such as ''beta blockers'', can interfere with the treatment and/or increase the risk of side effects. You may have to stop ''allergy'' shots if you are taking these medications. ''Talk to your doctor about the safety of continuing the ''allergy'' shots if you are ''pregnant'' or planning to become ''pregnant''. ' "
What Should I Expect After Allergy Shots?,"'Usually, you will be monitored for about 30 minutes after receiving an ''allergy'"" shot to make sure that you don't develop side effects such as ""'itchy'' eyes, ''shortness of breath'', ''runny nose'"", or tight throat. If you develop these symptoms after you leave the doctor's office, take an ""'antihistamine'"" and go back to your doctor's office or go to the nearest emergency room. ""'Redness, swelling, or irritation within one inch of the site of the injection is normal. These symptoms should go away within 4 to 8 hours after receiving the shot. ' "
Are Allergy Shots Effective for All Allergies?,"""The effectiveness of immunotherapy varies depending on the severity of a person's ""'allergies'' and the number of substances to which the person is ''allergic''. In general, however, immunotherapy is effective for ''allergies'' to stinging insects, a variety of pollens and dust mites, as well as for ''allergic'' ''asthma''. It is also effective for molds and pet dander. Immunotherapy is not proven to be effective for ''hives'' or ''food allergies''. ' "
When Should I Call My Doctor?,"'After receiving your allergy shot, call your doctor and go to the nearest emergency room if you develop ''shortness of breath'', tight throat, or any other symptoms of concern. ' "
Beyond Allergy Shots: New Approaches to Immunotherapy,"'In addition to the traditional allergy shots, several new immunotherapy procedures have been proposed, including: ''WebMD Medical Reference' Rush immunotherapy: This approach involves a more rapid, or 
	rushed, build-up to the maintenance dose of extract. During the initial 
	phase of treatment, increasing doses of allergen are given every few hours 
	rather than every few days or weeks. There is a greater risk of a body-wide 
	reaction with this approach, so rush immunotherapy generally is done in a 
	hospital under close medical supervision. In some cases, pre-treatment with 
	medications can reduce the risk of an allergic reaction during rush 
	immunotherapy. Oral immunotherapy: Oral, or sublingual-swallow, immunotherapy 
	works in the same way as allergy shots by giving increasing doses of 
	allergen to gradually build up a person's tolerance. The difference with 
	oral immunotherapy is the allergen extract is given as drops, usually placed 
	under the tongue and then swallowed, rather than through injections. This 
	type of immunotherapy has been shown to be helpful in a select patient 
	population. However, formulations for sublingual-swallow use are not 
	available in the United States, nor has sublingual administration received 
	approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Intranasal immunotherapy: Controlled, well-designed studies have 
	shown intranasal administration of grass, birch tree, and house dust mite 
	allergen extracts was effective at reducing nasal symptoms of rhinitis. 
	Local irritation to the nasal mucosa was the main side effect. However, the 
	effect of nasal administration may not have the longer lasting benefits that 
	have been associated with traditional immunotherapy. Currently, intranasal 
	immunotherapy is not used in the United States."
Allergy Treatment Begins at Home,"'Avoidance is always the best treatment for allergies regardless of which allergens are the triggers. Interestingly enough, the most effective, least expensive, and simplest options are not always followed. Many people choose medications or ''vaccinations'' instead, despite their drawbacks. Fortunately, there are lots of simple methods, both old and new, to help with avoidance. Remember, putting into practice any of these measures can only be helpful in managing your allergies.'""The good news is that you really don't have to strip your house down to the bare bones to make it ""'allergy''-proof. Thorough and regular cleaning generally makes a huge difference in keeping your house as ''mold'' and dust-free as possible. Patients with ''asthma'' or ''allergic rhinitis'' that are due to dust mites, molds, or other ''indoor allergens'' can feel better by taking these simple measures:''When patients get started with the process of ""''allergy''-proofing"" their homes, one of two things usually happens. They either do nothing or ""overdo it."" Some patients become so overwhelmed with all the different methods of ''allergy'""-proofing that they simply do nothing. That's always a disappointing outcome, especially when the process is so straightforward and inexpensive. Just focusing on the basics of a routine and thorough cleaning and temperature and humidity reduction can lead to fewer symptoms and a vastly improved quality of life.""""Sometimes, the opposite occurs. The allergy-proofing process becomes all-consuming and inordinately expensive. Overpriced and often inefficient whole-house filtration devices are installed when simple cleaning and reduction of humidity and temperature would have been adequate. Clearly, there are situations in which extreme measures need to be undertaken. Before going down this path, however, it's best to consult with your doctor. Start with the easy things first.""'The next section will describe the best steps to take in allergy-proofing your home. Always take a calculated approach, stepping up the process as needed for certain problems. First, we will focus on the best ways to clean and in the second part, on the available technologies.'   Keep the home cool (between 68 and 72 degrees F); Maintain a low humidity (between 40 and 50%); and Make certain there is good ventilation."
Cleaning and More Cleaning: What Really Helps?,"'If you are going to undertake to thoroughly clean your home, it is best to ensure at the beginning that the techniques being used are the most effective. The tips discussed below will help you achieve the maximum benefit for all of your efforts.''Soap & Hot Water:'' Scientific studies of patients who are ''allergic'' to dust mites have shown that taking steps to minimize ''dust mite'' allergens in the bedroom leads to a decrease in allergic symptoms and medication requirements. Emphasis is placed on the bedroom since people spend at least one-third of a 24 hour day there. It is also the room with the greatest number of dust mites.'""New synthetic bedding materials are available that are equivalent to down for warmth but can withstand washing more easily because the fibers don't clump. The ideal water temperature for washing is at least 130 degrees F to completely kill the dust mites found throughout the bedding.""'When the hot water heater is set to achieve a temperature of 130 degrees F, precautions must be taken to prevent scalding a child. For example, at bath time, always remain in the room with a child and make sure to always turn off the ""hot"" water faucet first and finish with the ""''cold''"" faucet.''The choice of bedding materials becomes important. They must be able to withstand the rigors of weekly hot water washing in order to kill the dust mites and remove accumulated allergens. Many bedding materials may be bulky, making them more difficult to wash. It may be easier to use several layers for warmth instead of bulky items for ease of washing. Since any type of blanket material can support dust ''mite'' growth, it is important to select one that can withstand repeated washings.''Vacuuming the Right Way:'"" If the carpet can't be replaced by a solid surface such as tile, linoleum, or hardwood, then it must be cleaned thoroughly and frequently. Also remember to vacuum upholstered furniture, draperies, and other fabric items that cannot be washed, removed or replaced. The trouble with vacuuming is that the allergenic dust mite and mold particles become airborne during the process. Dust mite particles can remain airborne for about 15 minutes and be redistributed throughout the home environment. Allergic persons clearly should not be doing the vacuuming and should also stay out of the area until the dust particles resettle. Dust mite particles also become airborne during bedding changes or the placement of dust covers on the mattress, box spring, and pillows. For severely allergic people, these tasks can lead to significant allergy and possible ""'asthma'' attacks. Those affected by these allergies should definitely not perform these chores.''Allergic persons should not perform vacuuming tasks and should keep out of the immediate environment for at least 1 hour after the vacuuming has been completed. Damp dusting should then follow to catch any loose particles.''The vacuum cleaner collecting bag acts as the primary filter in most vacuum cleaning systems. A standard bag can be replaced with a high-filtration multi-layer bag and an exhaust filter can be added. These measures prevent ''allergen'' particles from escaping and becoming airborne during the vacuuming process. Replacing the vacuum ''bags'' and adding exhaust filters are economical ways to increase the efficiency of an older vacuum. These bags and filters are easily obtained from allergy supply houses. The filters are available in 8"" x 10"" sheets that can be cut to size for any canister vacuum. Very expensive vacuum units with built-in HEPA systems (High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter) have been available for years. Now, more affordable brands of vacuums come equipped with HEPA filters and a removable canister that can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher. This system eliminates the problem with vacuum bags. As the older generation of vacuums is phased out, this development should be quite helpful in allergy control. Whole-house vacuum systems, although quite expensive, are also helpful because the dirt collection system is located outside the house, usually in the garage.''Dust mites, molds, animal danders, and insect debris are difficult to thoroughly clean from the environment. However, it really is easier and quicker to clean a hard surface such as wood, tile, vinyl, or leather than it is to clean all those nooks and crannies found in carpet, fabric, or other soft surfaces.''Replacing the carpet with a hard-surfaced floor can eliminate over 90% of dust mites. If you absolutely have to have carpet, get the kind that has a low pile.'""The following is a list of suggestions for how to make allergy-proofing an easier task. Hopefully, these ideas will lead to other methods you can use to thoroughly clean and maintain your environment allergy-free. Take it one step at a time and focus on the bedrooms first. If you plan on moving, pay close attention to steps that can be taken to allergy-proof prior to moving into the new house. It is much easier to put these ideas into action in the beginning than after everything is in place. It's really not as hard as it looks!""""Baby's Room - Special Tips:"""" It's a good idea to eliminate potential irritants and allergens from your baby's environment. Here's what you can do to help eliminate potential sources of allergens from your baby's world."" Avoid ornate furniture. Plain, simple designs accumulate less dust. No open bookshelves; they are great dust-catchers. Keep all clothes in drawers or closets, never lying about the room. Enclose wool clothes in plastic zipper bags. Avoid mothballs, insect sprays, tar paper, or camphor. Keep drawers and closet doors closed. Remove as much clutter as possible to make cleaning easier. Place hard-to-clean items in closets, drawers, or display cabinets with glass doors. When choosing furnishings, it is best to go with wood, leather, vinyl, or rubberized canvas furniture and avoid upholstered pieces. Upholstery easily traps allergens and is much harder to clean. You might try washable slipcovers on existing upholstered furniture. Install wood, tile, or linoleum flooring. Limit throw rugs to those that can be easily cleaned in the washer. They should be able to withstand washing weekly. Use allergen-proof encasings for pillows, mattresses, and box springs. Tape over zippers to help prevent leaks. Vacuum all casings frequently. Store nothing under the bed. Use washable cotton or synthetic blankets, not fuzzy surfaced ones. Use easily laundered cotton bedspreads or coverlets; avoid chenille. Install roll-up washable cotton or synthetic window shades. Avoid Venetian blinds, mini-blinds, and pleated shades. Use washable cotton or fiberglass curtains. Avoid draperies and decorative fabric window treatments! Install central air conditioning or window units. Keep windows closed, especially during periods of high pollen counts and windy conditions. Grasses, weeds, and trees tend to pollinate during the early morning hours. Sleep with the windows closed. Use Dacron or other synthetics for pillows. Avoid feathers or foam rubber, which traps moisture and promotes mold and dust mite growth. Space heaters are preferred over hot air ducts. In homes with forced air heat, use filters or damp cheesecloth over inlets to reduce dust circulation. Change every two weeks. Consult your physician about air purifiers. Keep beds away from air vents. Damp dusting using a dampened cloth or an oiled mop will minimize the distribution of dust through the air. Wood or plastic chairs are best for the baby's room. Again, avoid all featherbedding. Use dust-proof casings for all bedding. Stuffed animals should never be placed in the crib and, if used, should be washable. Put most of the stuffed items in a closed chest or closet. Store them in a freezer bag when not in use. When it comes to gifts for children, ask for books rather than stuffed animals. Keep the books in a bookcase with doors to help reduce allergens. Humidifiers should be reserved for croup. They should not be used routinely since they increase the dust mite and mold counts. If a humidifier is required, the cool water variety is safer than a steam humidifier in terms of burns. Also, be sure to change the water daily if a humidifier is necessary. Animal fur is a potential allergen. It's best to keep pets out of the baby's room. Overhead mobiles and wall hangings collect dust! Baby bumpers should be simple and washable. No ruffles or pleats. Ruffled curtains and Venetian blinds collect a lot of dust. Vertical blinds are preferable. If levelers or shutters are used, be sure to clean them weekly with a damp cloth. The crib should be placed away from air vents. A HEPA filter (High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter) can be placed under the crib. The filter will help to decrease airborne allergens such as pollens, mold spores, and animal danders."
What are great techniques for mold patrol?,"'Mold spores can pop up anywhere. There are lots of ways to deal with this persistent problem that is cost-effective and really work. Dealing with mold requires elbow grease, patience, and mold know-how. Do not give up; the effort is well worth it.''Allergy Alert''Greenhouses, antique shops, saunas, sleeping bags, summer cottages, and hotel rooms are sources of increased ''mold exposure''. Automobile air conditioners may harbor mold.''Numerous cleaning products specializing in mold control are available. The active ingredients in these products that are effective against molds are bleach and ammonia. So why should you pay a premium for anti-mold preparations when you can readily prepare the mixture at home for a fraction of the cost? As long as you are aware of the fabric fading effects and the potentially caustic nature of these cleaning materials, there should be no problems. Limited areas of mold collection (as occurs in the bathroom) can be cleaned with a bleach solution. An old ''toothbrush'' and bleach work wonders on the dark mildew that often collects between the tiles. If there is carpet in the bathroom (ideally there shouldn\'t be since this is a ""moisture trap"" for mold), be careful not to drip the bleach on the carpet! Regularly using a ""squeegee"" along with a bottle of diluted bleach will help keep the mold spores under control.'""Shower curtains present a special problem for mold control. Once the curtain is stained with mold spots, it might be worth a wash and rinse cycle with bleach. Usually, however, by the time you can see dime-size deposits of mold on the plastic shower curtain, it's probably not worth the effort. At this point, it would be better to purchase a vinyl curtain with a mold inhibitor. (These are available for use in motel rooms.)""""Larger areas, especially under the house, should be treated with either Orthocine, Captan's powder (8 oz in a gallon of water), or bleach (mix 1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water). These products are available in hardware stores. Using rubber gloves, scrub the affected areas, and repeat the process in 2 hours.""'For even more extensive molds under the house, buy a 5 lb. bag of Bordeaux mixture (mostly copper sulfate) from any regular nursery and mix it with 15 to 20 gallons of water in a large tank sprayer. Spray the areas under the house, the ground, and all wood thoroughly at least 3 to 4 times a year for the first several years.''If the Bordeaux mixture is unavailable or does not control the problem, Ziram can be used in a 1-2% spray solution. Mix 3 ounces of the concentrate to 1 gallon of water. Ziram can also be used in the home for walls and floors. When applied to some fabrics, it may produce a slightly yellow color. Protective clothing should always be used when spraying this fungicide. One application of Ziram is usually sufficient for mold control.''Caution: DO NOT STORE FUNGICIDES NEAR FIRE OR OPEN FLAMES. ALWAYS BE SURE THERE IS GOOD VENTILATION DURING USE BECAUSE MANY OF THESE SUBSTANCES ARE TOXIC!''Farmers, gardeners, bakers, brewers, florists, carpenters, mill workers, upholsterers, and paperhangers have increased exposure to mold due to their occupations. Your allergist can offer specific recommendations for handling these work environments.' Lower the humidity level in the house. Use fans for proper ventilation. Clean visible mold from walls and ceilings. Keep firewood outside since the bark is covered with mold. Add mold inhibitor to paint before applying if it will be used in a damp environment, especially on brick and cinderblock walls in a basement or shady areas. Mold tends to grow in closets, as they tend to be dark and damp. Dry shoes and boots before storing them. Consider a chemical moisture remover (desiccant) such as calcium carbonate flakes or crystals. One brand is Dri-Out Dome, which is readily available through allergy catalogs and home improvement stores. Do not carpet the bathroom. Mold grows in refrigerators. Keep them clean and defrosted. Remove spoiled food, preferably before it gets that way! Correct seepage or flooding problems and remove the water-damaged carpet. Carpet and pad should not be laid on a concrete floor since this is a great place for moisture to accumulate, resulting in a flourishing population of dust mites and mold. Remove moldy stored items from the basement and keep it clean."
How can people with allergies ideally control the air quality and climate in their homes?,"'Controlling the air quality and climate of your home may sound daunting, but it is actually not that difficult to achieve and can lead to substantial benefits. Good maintenance of these systems can increase the benefits you will receive and prolong the life-span of these devices.''HEPA Filters:'' HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air-filter. These devices were developed during the Apollo era of space exploration. They can filter most substances from the air, down to 0.3 microns in size. (A micron is a unit of length equivalent to 1/1000 of a millimeter.) They are helpful in filtering pollen, mold spores, animal dander, and fumes.'""HEPA filters aren't for dust mites. Dust mite allergens are heavy and fall to the ground quickly, thus avoiding being trapped by HEPA filters.""'It is important to remember that you can not filter the world. In other words, you need to run these filters with the windows closed. The size of the room also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding what size HEPA filter to purchase.''HEPA filters have become increasingly available in many discount home improvement stores. Previously, these devices had been primarily available through allergy supply companies and catalogs at a premium price. Now, you can do some comparative shopping before you buy it. Other factors to consider before buying include the required interval between changing filters, the ease of obtaining replacement filters, and warranties. One critical factor in the use of HEPA filters is the noise level generated. Many people stop operating the unit due to the ""white noise"" associated with the device. Make sure that you listen to the device before you purchase it. The good news is that the newer generation of filters is much quieter.''Another type of filter is the electrostatic filter. So far, these have not been shown to be as efficient as the HEPA filter.''An important point to make here is that HEPA filters are not the ultimate solution to the problem of indoor allergens. They can help to some degree but in no way do they replace cleaning, temperature and humidity reduction, clutter removal, and avoidance of allergens such as pet dander.''Dehumidifiers & Humidifiers:'' Remember, house mites require high humidity to thrive. Dehumidifying the air is easily accomplished with an air conditioner, but this is practical only in hot weather. The correct placement and use of fans and vents can help reduce humidity as can a dehumidifier machine. It pays to find a knowledgeable sales source that can help you determine the appropriate size machine needed for your individual home or office. Clearly, the most important point about a dehumidifier is that it must be kept scrupulously clean. Otherwise, molds will flourish in the collection chamber making your problem worse than it was in the first place. Dehumidifiers must be cleaned daily. Some models have an automatic shut off mechanisms that keep the tank from overflowing and some have a continuous drainage system.''Humidity gauges are readily available at any hardware store. A range of 40-50% humidity is good. Humidity lower than 35% can make ''breathing'' uncomfortable for some people with ''asthma'' or other respiratory conditions. Generally speaking, low humidity is not the health problem that high humidity can be.''Humidifiers are rarely needed except for children with ''croup''. In most parts of the country, the humidity seldom drops below 35% and the nostrils and airways provide natural moisture. However, it is true that in certain parts of the country, a well-heated home can become overly dry.''Croup is a viral infection in small children that is characterized by a harsh, barking ''cough''. The condition is frequently worse at night. One of the recommended treatments is mist or steam, which is best provided by a cool air humidifier. Vaporizers should be avoided due to the risk of ''burns''.''As previously noted, some central hot-air systems may include built-in humidifiers that can make the air more comfortable to breathe. However, there are definite problems with this type of system. Not only can these units blow mold spores and dust all through the air, but keeping these systems mold and bacteria-free is extremely difficult.''Stand-alone humidifiers are available and are frequently used in homes with antiques or fine art that could be damaged from excessive dryness. They are often recommended for people with respiratory problems and ''eczema'', which can be worsened by dryness. The truth is, though, that humidifiers tend to cause more problems than they solve. They should be used only sparingly, as their health benefits are primarily limited to infants or young children with croup.''The most frequently used stand-alone unit is the evaporative humidifier. This system uses a wick or pad to absorb water from a reservoir. A fan then disperses the water vapor through the air. This method can cause bacterial counts in the air to skyrocket, leading to ""humidifier ''fever'',"" a ''flu-like'' infection of the respiratory tract.''Although ultrasonic humidifiers kill the bacteria, they also spray parts of the dead microorganisms into the air along with ''minerals'"" that then deposit on surfaces throughout homes. Fine white dust on furniture evidence these mineral deposits. Generally, the ultrasonic models are no longer distributed but these devices are kept for years, so be sure to check what type of model you might own. A newer type of device is a vibratory humidifier that doesn't cause mineral deposits. All humidifiers should be used sparingly and MUST be cleaned after each use to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria and mold spores. Just by lowering the temperature of the home during the winter, the air will contain more moisture and the need for humidifiers will be minimized.""'Air Conditioning & Heating Systems:'' Air conditioners are critical in filtering summertime air for patients allergic to molds and pollens. They also function as excellent dehumidifiers, thus limiting the growth of dust mites and molds. Another unexpected benefit is that the airflow discourages cockroaches since they prefer non-ventilated spaces.''Filters on both central and window units require frequent changing and or cleaning to remain efficient and prevent mold growth.''Separate room or area filtration units are more effective than whole house filtration units that are installed on central air systems. Claims that an entire house can be adequately filtered with just one unit are false. A HEPA filter can only cover a certain number of cubic ''feet'' and separate units need to be installed throughout the system.''Central air-conditioning and heating systems may also come with electrostatic filters that catch smaller particles than regular filters. The filters charge the particles in the air as they pass through the filter. The charged particles are then trapped by an oppositely charged plate in the unit. These devices must be cleaned frequently as well.''A concern about electrostatic filters has been ozone production, which can make asthma worse. This hazard has been reduced by the addition of charcoal filters.''Unfortunately, it is not clear whether the special filters available for home heating and air-conditioning units are completely effective. Be sure to inquire about the particle size that the filter is guaranteed to trap. A minimum of 5 microns is recommended. At this point, it appears that of the two options, HEPA filtration is superior.''Another option is the placement of individual filters over the outlet ducts themselves. These filters should be cleaned weekly and replaced as necessary. They are readily available from most allergy supply stores and catalogs and home hardware stores.'""Some forced-air heating systems come with built-in humidifiers. This feature can backfire because dust particles are stirred up by the hot air and mold can flourish in the humidifier itself. Cleaning these units is of the utmost importance, but this can be a cumbersome task. If mold is a problem, it's probably best to have the humidifier removed.""'Options apart from forced air systems include space heaters and radiant-heat systems. These two methods of heating are advantageous in that allergens and irritants are not distributed throughout the home environment as they are with forced air systems.' "
How can dust covers help?,"'People with allergies to dust mites and molds are well served by encasing their pillows, mattress, and box springs in zippered, allergen-impermeable encasings. These covers provide the patient with a protective barrier against dust mites, their fecal particles, and mold antigens. This is critical in reducing your dust mite exposure, especially if you take into account that most people spend at least one-third of each day in the bedroom. The bedroom is also a haven for dust mites due to its warmth and humidity and to the abundant food source from human skin flakes and secretions.''Formerly, dust covers were only available in plastic. Fortunately, the technology has improved to the point that the newer fabrics allow airflow but completely prevent the passage of antigens through the impermeable fibers. The flow of air and ''perspiration'' through the fabric provides excellent comfort without the clammy feel associated with plastic. These products are increasingly available through various allergy catalogs, allergy supply houses, home supply stores, and an ever-increasing number of online computer sites. Grocery store chains are increasingly carrying these products as awareness of their effectiveness has grown. Be sure to examine the samples available so you will be comfortable with your product choice. There is a range of prices for these products, so be sure to compare them. Your allergist will typically have an array of catalogs and order forms to assist you in your search.'""When people invest in dust covers, they sometimes omit the purchase of the box spring cover in an effort to economize. Since the body is not in direct contact with the box spring, people might think it is not important enough to bother with it. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Several years ago, a study compared the dust mite counts of beds with partial versus complete coverings. It was quite clear that unless all parts are covered, the entire bed becomes reinfested with dust mites in a short period of time. The good news is that you can use a less expensive vinyl cover on the box spring since it does not touch the skin. The investment in complete dust covers is well worth the money.""""Researchers in Spain recently found that children sleeping in the bottom and top bunks of bunk beds were equally likely to develop an allergy to dust mites. However, the child sleeping on the bottom bunk was at a significantly higher risk of developing asthma than the child on the top bunk. It may be that the health aspects of bunking together should be considered when planning children's room designs, especially for families with asthma and allergy histories."" "
What are carpet powders? Can they help?,"""By this point, we all know how important it is to remove the carpets, especially in the bedroom. Sometimes though, this just is not practical. Perhaps you are renting your home or apartment or maybe you just had the carpet replaced before you became aware of your dust mite allergy. Don't worry, there are ways around this.""""One option is tannic acid (3% solution). Although the acid doesn't kill the dust mites, it does destroy the mite allergens. The solution can be easily sprayed on troublesome surfaces and is fast-acting. It may, however, cause staining of carpets and upholstery. On a positive note, tannic acid may inactivate cat allergens, but this requires a frequent application. Unfortunately, tannic acid has a temporary effect at best.""'Another option is an ""acaracide,"" which comes as a powder or spray that actually kills the dust mites and decreases the antigen levels. This product is available through allergy supply companies but remains unavailable in Canada.''The presence of a smoker in the home will sabotage the best of all possible treatment programs for allergies and asthma. If you, your spouse or partner, or your child has chronic allergies or asthma problems, '""don't smoke"""" and don't allow ""'smoking'' in the home. ''Smoking'' may be the reason why allergy and ''asthma symptoms'' are persisting despite an otherwise thorough allergy control and medication treatment program. Children who are exposed to ''cigarette'' smoke are at a 21% increased risk of developing asthma. There are no excuses and ""''smoking'' outside"" is not good enough. If you smoke, quit now. It\'s terrible for you and for everyone who lives with you.' "
What to do with the pets?,"'This is frequently a challenging issue for both doctors and allergy sufferers. Common sense and emotion often collide and differences of opinion amongst family members may complicate the problem. In order of their effectiveness, the recommended control measures for a significantly allergic or ''asthmatic'' individual are:''Even after you have found a new home for your pet, animal allergens may still persist in your home for many months in the typical reservoirs, carpeting, upholstery, and mattresses. Repeated vacuuming, steam cleaning, and applications of a 3% tannic acid solution will help neutralize the remaining allergens.''If parting with your pet is unacceptable, the following are additional tips for managing the home environment.''Kittens take to regular bathing better than do older cats. Start slowly with a few drops of tepid water (soap is not necessary) on its fur and then progress to a full rinse. Reward the cat with treats - this might help.' Find another home for the pet. Keep the pet outdoors at all times. Remember, though, that the allergens will come into your home on your clothes. Keep the pet out of the allergic person's bedroom at all times. When the pet is indoors, keep it in a room with few allergy reservoirs, such as the kitchen. Provide your cat or dog with its own bed. Use a HEPA filter in the bedroom and a portable room heater if needed. Seal off the room air ducts. Wear a mask when handling the litter box, or even better, have a non-allergic family member do it. Vacuum with a double filter or a HEPA filter. Wash the cat weekly to help remove surface allergens."
What do I do with those ghastly cockroaches?,"'The elimination of cockroaches is best accomplished by using a professional exterminator. However, this is only the first step. After the cockroaches have been eliminated, the areas they inhabited must be thoroughly cleaned since their residual debris is highly allergenic. Entry points should be sealed to prevent re-infestation. Use covered trash bins and empty them frequently. Do not store cardboard boxes, newspapers, grocery bags, or empty cans and bottles in your home as they can serve as breeding areas.'

What is a skin test?,"'A skin test is a test done on the skin to identify if a substance (an ''allergen'') is potentially triggering an ''allergic reaction''. Environmental allergens (aeroallergens), including furry animals, dust mites, tree ''pollen'', grass pollen, weed pollen, and molds can cause ''allergic'' eye symptoms, nasal symptoms, and ''asthma symptoms''. Allergens that can trigger allergic reactions involving the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and ''cardiovascular system'' include foods, medications, latex, and insect venoms.' "
How is an allergy skin test done?,"'Allergy'' skin testing is noninvasive and generally very well tolerated, even by small children. A small amount of the suspected ''allergy''-provoking substance (the allergen) is placed on the skin. The skin is then gently punctured through the small drop with a special sterile puncture device. An ''allergy'' skin test is also called a prick/puncture test. The older terminology was ""scratch test."" With venoms, certain medications, such as ''penicillin'', and in certain cases with aeroallergens, a second step of testing involves injecting a small amount of the allergen into the skin with a small needle. This is called an intradermal or an intracutaneous test. This type of testing should never be performed for foods.' "
What is a positive skin test result?,"'A positive skin test involves the formation of a bump (wheal) and redness (flare). In addition to the allergens in question, skin testing is also performed with a positive control (histamine) that should always cause a skin reaction, and a negative control, (saline), that should not cause a reaction. A test is positive if the allergen causes a wheal 3 mm greater than the negative control, and if the skin has a response to the histamine, as well. It is important to know that individuals cannot undergo skin testing if they are using ''antihistamines'', since this blocks the histamine-mediated reaction.''For example, if a specific ''food allergy'"" is suspected, a skin test uses a dilute extract of the suspected food. A small drop of this particular liquid extract is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. This underlying skin is gently punctured through the small drop with a special puncture device. The test is positive if there is a wheal and flare response described above. A positive test raises the possibility of a true allergy but is not diagnostic or confirmatory for having a true allergy. If there is no reaction with a wheal and flare, the test is read as negative and being allergic is very unlikely. If the skin test is positive, it implies that the patient has a type of antibody (IgE) on specialized cells in the skin that release histamine to cause symptoms of an allergic reaction. These cells are called mast cells and the IgE antibody bound to them is specific to the food being tested, like a puzzle piece. It is important to note that a positive skin test does not automatically mean a person is allergic to a food, medication, or aeroallergen. The skin test is one component of the information an allergist uses to make an accurate diagnosis, but the most important information comes from the patient's reported symptoms."" "
What are the advantages of skin tests?,"'Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe. They can be very helpful in specifically identifying causes of ''allergies''.' "
Is there danger to a skin test?,"'In very rare cases, patients may have a ''severe allergic reaction'' involving multiple body systems to skin testing. For this reason, skin testing should be completed by an experienced allergist who is well prepared to diagnose and treat a severe allergic reaction. Although both are safe, intradermal or intracutaneous skin testing is more likely to cause a severe allergic reaction compared to prick/puncture testing.' "
What is done if a skin test can't be done?,"'For these patients, a doctor may use special blood tests, such as the RAST and the ''ELISA''. These tests measure the presence of specific types of IgE in the blood.''These tests may cost more than skin tests, and results are not available immediately. As with skin testing, positive RAST and ''ELISA tests'' do not by themselves necessarily make the final diagnosis.' "
What are causes and risk factors for hair loss?,"'Because there are many types of hair loss, finding the cause can be challenging. This review will cover the most common causes of hair loss occurring on normal unscarred scalp skin. The medical term for hair loss is alopecia.''Most hair loss is not associated with systemic or internal disease, nor is poor ''diet'' a frequent factor. Hair may simply thin as a result of predetermined genetic factors and the overall ''aging'' process. Many men and women may notice mild physiologic thinning of hair starting in their 30s and 40s. Life vicissitudes, including illness, emotional ''trauma'', protein deprivation (during strict ''dieting''), and hormonal changes like those in ''pregnancy'', ''puberty'', and ''menopause'' may cause hair loss.''Several health conditions, including thyroid disease, ''iron deficiency anemia'', and secondary ''syphilis'', can cause hair loss. While ''thyroid blood tests'' and other lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), on people who have ordinary hair loss are usually normal, it is important to exclude treatable causes of hair loss.' "
What types of doctors treat hair loss?,"'A family physician, internist, or gynecologist can perform a basic health screening. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in problems of skin, hair, and nails and may provide more advanced diagnosis and treatment of hair thinning and loss. Sometimes a scalp biopsy may be necessary.''Although many medications list ""hair loss"" among their potential side effects, most ''drugs'' are not likely to induce hair loss. On the other hand, ''cancer'' treatment (for example, chemotherapy or ''radiation therapy'') and immunosuppressive medications commonly produce hair loss. Complete hair loss after chemotherapy usually regrows after six to 12 months.' "
How do physicians classify hair loss?,"'There are numerous ways to categorize hair loss. One must first examine the scalp to determine if the hair loss is due to the physical destruction and loss of hair follicles (scarring or cicatricial alopecia). If the scalp appears perfectly normal with plenty of empty hair follicles, this is called non-scarring hair loss. On the other hand, cicatricial alopecia permanently destroys the follicles. Non-scarring hair loss also happens in situations where there is physical or chemical damage to the hair shaft, resulting in breakage. Occasionally, it may be necessary to do a biopsy of the scalp to distinguish these conditions. Sometimes, a physician may pull a hair to examine the appearance of the hair shaft as well as the percentage of growing hairs (anagen phase). This article will concentrate on the non-scarring types of hair loss.''Some conditions produce small areas of hair loss, while others affect large areas of the scalp. Common causes of patchy hair loss are''Some common causes of diffuse hair loss are'   alopecia areata (small circular or coin size bald patches on the scalp that usually grow back within months), traction alopecia (thinning from tight braids or ponytails), trichotillomania (the habit of twisting or pulling hair out), tinea capitis (fungal infection), and secondary syphilis. pattern alopecia, drug-induced alopecia, protein malnutrition, and systemic disease-induced alopecia (cancer, endocrine disease, and telogen effluvium)."
What is alopecia areata?,"""A common skin condition, alopecia areata usually starts as a single quarter-sized circle of perfectly smooth bald skin. These patches usually regrow in three to six months without treatment. Sometimes, white hair temporarily regrows and then becomes dark. The most extensive form is alopecia totalis, in which the entire scalp goes bald. It's important to emphasize that patients who have localized hair loss generally don't go on to lose hair all over the scalp. Alopecia areata can affect hair on other parts of the body, too (for example, the beard or eyebrows).""'Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own hair follicles. Most patients, however, do not have systemic problems and need no medical tests. While people frequently blame alopecia areata on ""''stress'',"" in fact, it may be the other way around; that is, having alopecia may cause ''stress''.''Treatments for alopecia areata include injecting small amounts of steroids like triamcinolone into affected patches to stimulate hair growth. Although localized injections may not be practical for large areas, often this is a very effective treatment in helping the hairs return sooner. Other treatments, such as oral steroids, other immunosuppressives, or ultraviolet light therapy, are available for more widespread or severe cases but may be impractical for most patients because of potential side effects or risks. In most mild cases, patients can easily cover up or comb over the affected areas. In more severe and chronic cases, some patients wear hairpieces; nowadays, some men shave their whole scalp now that this look has become fashionable. Recently, investigators have noted some beneficial results in small groups of patients with extensive alopecia areata or alopecia totalis with a JAK1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib (Olumiant). Long-term studies are under way.' "
What is traction alopecia?,"""This is a small or localized hair loss area caused by repetitive or persistent pulling or traction on hair roots. Tight braids and ponytails can pull hard enough on hairs to make them fall out. If this happens, it's best to choose hairstyles that put less tension on hair. Doing this sooner helps to avoid permanent damage."" "
What is trichotillomania?,"""This refers to the habitual pulling or twisting of one's own hair. The scalp and eyelashes are often affected. Unlike alopecia areata patches, which are perfectly smooth, hair patches in trichotillomania show broken-off hairs. Treatment is often entirely behavioral. One has to notice the behavior and then consciously stop. Severe or resistant cases may require stress counseling with a therapist or psychologist or medical treatment with a psychiatrist. Several ""'antidepressant'' or anti-''anxiety'' medications can help with this condition.' "
What is tinea capitis?,"'Tinea'' is the medical word for fungal infection, and ''capitis'' means head. ''Tinea capitis'' is fungal infection of the scalp that for the most part affects school-age children. Tinea capitis is more common in black African or African-American scalps. This condition is rare in healthy adults. Bald spots usually show broken-off hairs accompanied by a ''dermatitis''. Oral antifungals can penetrate the hair roots and cure the infection, after which hair grows back. Sharing hats or combs and brushes may transmit tinea capitis.' "
What is generalized (diffuse) hair loss?,"'This is an overall hair thinning without specific bald spots or patterns. While this type of hair loss may not be noticeable to others, often the individual will feel their hair is not as thick or full as it previously was. Common conditions in this category are' telogen effluvium (rapid shedding after childbirth, fever, or sudden weight loss); androgenetic or androgenic hair loss (""male-pattern baldness,"" ""female-pattern baldness"")."
What is telogen effluvium?,"'Under normal conditions, scalp hairs live for about three years (the anagen, or growing, phase); they then enter the telogen, or resting, phase. During the three-month telogen period, the hair root shrivels up into a small ""club,"" then the hair falls out. It is therefore normal to lose about 100 hairs every day, more of them on days when shampooing loosens the hairs that are ready to fall out. The body then replaces the hairs.'""Sometimes people who worry about losing their hair start noticing hairs on their pillow or in the sink, not realizing that they've always been there. A close look at these will usually reveal the club at the end, showing that these hairs shed normally. Normally, about 10% of scalp hairs are in the telogen phase.""'Several circumstances produce a ""''shock'' to the system"" that alters the hair growth rhythm. As a result, as much as 30%-40% of the hairs can cycle into telogen. Three months later, hairs come out in a massive shedding (effluvium), especially near the front of the scalp. These include'""None of these need be life threatening, nor does hair loss usually follow them. (Moreover, it can happen after one pregnancy, but not the next.) But when the hair falls out, it's all over the place -- covering the pillow, clogging the drain, and so forth. Paradoxically, the more dramatic the hair loss, the better the prognosis, because when the body gets back into normal rhythm, most if not all of that hair comes back; these people need no special treatment. Normal shampooing can continue, because this only loosens hairs that were going to come out anyway.""   childbirth, high fever, sudden weight loss (crash dieting), surgery, severe illness, severe emotional stress or loss."
"What is androgenetic or androgenic alopecia (""male-pattern baldness,"" ""female-pattern baldness"")?","'This type of alopecia is often attributed to genetic predisposition and family history. Androgenic alopecia appears in both men and women. The hair loss in men is often faster, earlier onset, and more extensive.''Doctors refer to common baldness as ""androgenetic alopecia"" or ""androgenic alopecia,"" which implies that a combination of hormones and heredity (genetics) is necessary to develop the condition. The exact cause of this pattern is unknown. (The male hormones involved are present in both men and women.)''Even men who never ""go bald"" thin out somewhat over the years. Unlike those with reversible telogen shedding, those with common male-pattern hair loss don\'t notice much hair coming out; they just see that it\'s not there anymore. Adolescent boys notice some receding near the temples as their hairlines change from the straight-across boys\' pattern to the more ""M-shaped"" pattern of adult men. This normal development does not mean they are losing hair.' People inherit baldness through their mother's male relatives. Actually, genes from both the mother and the father determine baldness. Looking at one's family can give someone at best an educated guess about how he or she will turn out. Studies are ongoing in this field, and current research has been inconclusive about the inheritance patterns. Longer hair puts a strain on roots. It doesn't. And hats don't choke off the circulation to the scalp to cause hair loss either. Shampooing does not accelerate balding. ""Poor circulation"" does not cause hair loss, and massaging doesn't stop it."
What treatment is there for hair loss in men?,"'There are few scientifically proven and FDA-approved treatments for hair loss. There are thousands of unproven claims and products to help with hair regrowth. Many conditioners, shampoos, ''vitamins'', and other products claim to help hair grow in some unspecified way. Nioxin has been a popular brand of shampoo for hair loss, but there is no compelling evidence showing it is any more effective than regular shampoos. These products are usually harmless but generally not scientifically proven and therefore potentially useless. To slow down hair loss, there are at least four potentially effective, basic options. These include medications like Minoxidil, and Propecia, which are for long-term use. Stopping these drugs does not seem to worsen or exacerbate the prior hair loss. The patient will simply revert to the state he would have been in had he never started treatment.'   Minoxidil (Rogaine): This topical medication is available over the counter, and no prescription is required. Men and women can use it. It works best on the crown, less on the frontal region. Minoxidil is available as a 2% solution, 4% solution, an extra-strength 5% solution, and a new foam or mousse preparation. Rogaine may grow a little hair, but it's better at holding onto what's still there. There are few side effects with Rogaine. The main problem with this treatment is the need to keep applying it once or twice daily, and most men get tired of it after a while. In addition, minoxidil tends to work less well on the front of the head, which is where baldness bothers most men. Inadvertent application to the face or neck skin can cause unwanted hair growth in those areas. Finasteride (Propecia): This medication is FDA approved for use in only men with androgenic hair loss. Finasteride is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. It helps reduce hair loss by blocking the action of natural hormones in scalp hair follicles. Propecia is a lower-dose version of a commercially available drug called Proscar that helps shrink enlarged prostates in middle-aged and older men. Women of child-bearing potential should avoid finasteride. Propecia 1 mg tablets are available by prescription and taken once daily. Propecia may grow and thicken hair to some extent for some people, but its main use is to keep (maintain) hair that's still there. Studies have shown that this medication works well in some types of hair loss, and patients should use it for about six to 12 months before full effects are determined. This medication does not ""work"" in days to weeks, and its onset of visible improvement tends to be gradual. It may be best for men who still have enough hair to retain but also can help some regrow hair. Possible but very unlikely side effects include impotence or a decreased sex drive (libido). Studies show that these side effects were possibly slightly more common than seen in the general population and are reversible when patients stop taking the drug. The cost is about $70-$100/month, and most health insurers do not reimburse for the expense. A group of topical medications called prostaglandin analogs have recently began undergoing testing for potential hair regrowth. They may be used in men and women. These drugs are not currently FDA approved for scalp hair loss. Currently, these are primarily used for eyelash enhancement. One of the new medications is called bimatoprost (Latisse). Further testing and studies are required to assess the efficacy of these products in scalp hair loss. Bimatoprost solution is sometimes used off-label for help in selected cases of hair loss. It is currently FDA approved for cosmetic eyelash enhancement. Studies have shown it can treat hypotrichosis (short or sparse) of the eyelashes by increasing their growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. This medication is also commercially available as Lumigan, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is not known exactly how this medication works in hair regrowth, but it is thought to lengthen the anagen phase (active phase) of hair growth. Interestingly, during routine medical use of Lumigan eyedrops for glaucoma patients, it was serendipitously found that eyelashes got longer and thicker in many users. This led to clinical trials and the approval of cosmetic use of Latisse for eyelashes."
What other options do people have for hair loss?,"'There are many options and alternative cosmetic treatments for hair loss. Some of these are listed here and include hair-''fiber'' powders, hairpieces, synthetic wigs, human hair wigs, hair extensions, hair weaves, laser, and surgery.'   Hair-fiber powders: Colored, powdery fiber sprinkles are commercially available and may work to camouflage balding areas. These colored sprinkles have special properties that help them attach to hair and give a fuller appearance. Toppik is one manufacturer of these products and can be found online. These cosmetic products are available without a prescription, are fairly inexpensive ($20-$40 range), and quite safe with minimal risk. Often these may be used in addition to medical treatments like Rogaine, Propecia, and hair transplants, and they are a great temporary measure to tide one over for special occasions. Hairpieces: Among the time-honored ways to add hair temporarily are hairpieces or hair weaving, in which a mesh is attached to the remaining hair and artificial or human hair of similar color and texture is woven with existing hair. Quality varies considerably with price; also, hairpieces and weaves may stretch, oxidize, and loosen. Surgery or hair transplants: Surgical hair restoration approaches include various versions of hair transplantation (taking hair from the back and putting it near the front) or scalp reduction (cutting away bald areas and stitching the rest together). Transplant procedures have improved greatly in recent years. They can produce much more attractive and natural-looking results than older methods that sometimes leave a ""checkerboard"" or hair plug look. Many transplant patients now take Propecia to maintain or keep what they've transplanted. When considering a hair transplant, check the surgeon's credentials and experience carefully. Micrografts are some of the newest techniques whereby surgeons transplant single one to two hair follicles. Hair transplants may be very expensive and time-consuming procedures ranging widely anywhere from $1,000-$20,000, depending on the number of hair grafts transplanted. Typically, 500 or more hairs may be transplanted in a session. Low level laser devices approved by the FDA are promoted for use in male pattern hair loss. These devices are used at home without a physician's prescription and vary in cost from $50 to over $1,000. They come in the form of combs, helmets, and hats. Limited studies are moderately persuasive that they stimulate hair growth. Platelet rich plasma obtained from the processed whole blood of male patients with pattern hair loss and then reinjected into their own scalp has been suggested as an adjuvant treatment. The efficacy of this form of therapy is currently under investigation."
Is hair loss in women different than men?,"'Women lose hair on an ''inherited'' (genetic) basis, too, but female pattern hair loss tends to be more diffuse, with less likelihood of the crown and frontal hairline being lost. Although some women may notice hair thinning as early as their 20s, the pace of hair loss tends to be gradual, often taking years to become obvious to others. There seems to be a normal physiologic thinning that comes with age and occurs in many women in their early to mid-30s. More women have underlying causes of hair loss than men. These include treatable conditions like ''anemia'' and thyroid disease and ''polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS'""). These conditions are diagnosed by blood tests along with a historical and physical evidence. Although a few studies have suggested that baldness may be inherited through the mother's family genes, these theories require further testing. Current studies are inconclusive. Although not indicated for female pattern balding, ""'spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') has had some success in treating this condition.''While stories about hats choking off follicles or long hair pulling on the roots may be more folklore, repeat hair trauma like tightly woven hair pulled back and consistent friction can potentially worsen or cause localized hair loss in some individuals. Individuals who pull their hair tightly back in a rubber band can develop a localized hair loss at the front of the scalp.'   Longer hair does not necessarily put a strain on roots. Shampooing does not accelerate hair loss; it just removes those that were ready to fall out anyway. Coloring, perming, and conditioning the hair do not usually cause hair loss. Burns or severe processing may produce hair fragility and breakage. Styles that pull tight may cause some loss, but hair coloring and ""chemicals"" usually don't."
What about pregnancy hair loss?,"'Pregnancy may cause many changes in the scalp hair. As the hormones fluctuate during pregnancy, a large number of women feel their hair thickens and becomes fuller. This may be related to change in the number of hairs ''cycling'' in the growth phase of hair growth, but the exact reason is unknown. Quite often, there may be a loss of hair (telogen effluvium) after delivery or a few months later which will eventually normalize.' "
What specific treatments are there for hair loss in women?,"'Female hair loss treatments include minoxidil (Rogaine), hair transplants, hair-powder fibers like Toppik, wigs, hair extensions, and weaves.' Minoxidil (Rogaine) is available over the counter and available in 2%, 4%, and 5% concentrations. It may be something of a nuisance to apply twice daily, but it has been shown to help conserve hair and may even grow some. Minoxidil tends to grow very fine small hairs wherever it is applied. It is important to avoid running the liquid onto the face or neck where it can also grow hair. It is marketed for women at the 2% concentration but may be used in higher strengths as directed by a doctor. Surgical procedures like hair transplants can be useful for some women as well as men to ""fill in"" thinned-out areas."
What vitamins are good for hair loss? Are there home remedies for hair loss?,"'A good daily multivitamin containing zinc, vitamin B, folate, iron, and calcium is a reasonable choice, although there is no good evidence that ''vitamins'' have any meaningful benefit in alopecia. Newer studies suggest that ''vitamin D'' may be somewhat helpful and worth considering. Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies like iron or vitamin B12 may be diagnosed by blood tests and treated.''Multiple vitamins, including biotin, have been promoted for hair growth, but solid scientific studies for many of these claims are lacking. While taking biotin and other ''supplements'"" marketed for hair, skin, and nails probably won't worsen anything, it may also not necessarily help the situation. Therefore, advertised hair-regrowth ""'supplements'' should be approached with mild caution. There is only anecdotal evidence that oral or topical application ''garlic'', onion juice, saw palmetto, coconut oil, ''evening primrose oil'', apple cider vinegar, creatine, and pumpkin seed oil are of benefit for hair loss.'  "
Can itchy scalp cause hair loss?,"'Itchy scalp'' may be a symptom of a scalp disease that could produce hair loss. Causes may include ''seborrheic dermatitis'' (''dandruff'') and ''psoriasis''. Treatments may include medicated shampoos like ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''), OTC ''dandruff'' shampoos, and topical steroid creams and lotions to help decrease ''itching''.' "
What is the prognosis for hair loss?,'The prognosis for androgenic non-scarring hair loss is guarded due to the fact that there is no cure for the problem. Medications must be taken indefinitely. Other types of hair loss have a good chance of spontaneously resolving.' 
How do people prevent hair loss?,"'Hair-loss prevention depends on the underlying cause. Good hair hygiene with regular shampooing is a basic step but is probably of little benefit. Good ''nutrition'', especially adequate levels of iron and vitamin B, is helpful. Treatment of underlying medical conditions like thyroid disease, anemia, and hormonal imbalances may useful in prevention.' "
What is alopecia areata?,'Alopecia areata is an acquired skin disease that can affect all hair-bearing skin and is characterized by localized areas of non-scarring alopecia (''hair loss'').' Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other medical problems. Most often these bald areas regrow their hair spontaneously. Alopecia areata is rare before 3 years of age. There seems to be a significant inherited predisposition for the development of alopecia areata.
What causes alopecia areata?,"""Current evidence suggests that alopecia areata is caused by an abnormality in the immune system that damages hair follicles. This particular abnormality leads to autoimmunity, a misguided immune system that tends to attack its own body. As a result, the immune system attacks particular tissues of the body. In alopecia areata, for unknown reasons, the body's own immune system attacks the hair follicles and disrupts normal hair formation. Biopsies of affected skin show immune lymphocytes penetrating into the hair bulb of the hair follicles."" Alopecia areata is occasionally associated with other autoimmune conditions such asthyroid disease,vitiligo,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andulcerative colitis. thyroid disease, vitiligo, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis or treatment of these diseases is unlikely to affect the course of alopecia areata. Sometimes, alopecia areata occurs within family members, suggesting a role of genes."
What are the signs and symptoms of the different patterns of alopecia areata?,"   The most common pattern is one or more well-defined spots of hair loss on the scalp. If alopecia occurs in an ophiasis pattern (hair loss involving the temporal and posterior scalp) or if large areas of the scalp are involved for long periods of time, the prognosis is worse. A more generalized form of hair loss is referred to as diffuse alopecia areata where there is widespread dramatic thinning of the scalp hair. Occasionally, all of the scalp hair is entirely lost, a condition referred to as alopecia totalis. Less frequently, the loss of all of the hairs on the entire body, called alopecia universalis, occurs."
Who is affected by alopecia areata?," Alopecia areata tends to occur most often in adults 30 to 60 years of age. However, it can also affect older individuals and, rarely, young children. Alopecia areata is not contagious. It should be distinguished from hair shedding that may occur following the discontinuation of hormonal estrogen and progesterone therapies for birth control or the hair shedding associated with the end of pregnancy. There are a number of treatable conditions that could be confused with alopecia areata."
How do health care professionals diagnose alopecia areata?," The characteristic finding of alopecia areata is one or more well-circumscribed areas of otherwise normal, hairless skin in hair-bearing areas. Occasionally, it may be necessary to biopsy the scalp to confirm the diagnosis. Other findings that may be helpful are the appearance of short hairs that presumably represent fractured hairs, short thin hairs, and gray hair growing in a bald area. Other causes of hair loss are generally excluded from the consideration by history and clinical evaluation."
What is the treatment for alopecia areata?,"'The course of typical alopecia areata is not predictable with a high likelihood of spontaneous remission. The longer the period of time of hair loss and the larger the area involved, the less likely the hair will regrow spontaneously. Therefore, there are a variety of treatments, but none of these can confidently be predicted to impact the course of this disease.'   Local steroid injections intracutaneously may be very helpful in restarting the hair growth cycle in treated areas. Steroid creams, lotions, and shampoos have been used for many years but are of limited benefit at best. Although oral systemic steroids are known to induce hair growth in affected patients, their long-term use is contraindicated because of the likelihood of undesirable side effects. The topical sensitizers, diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutylester, have been used in those suffering from recalcitrant alopecia areata or those with more than 50% hair loss. The goal of treatment is to create an allergic contact dermatitis of the scalp. This alteration in the immune response occasionally is accompanied by hair regrowth. The efficacy of the topical sensitizers has been demonstrated in both young children and adults, but it probably works less than half the time. Recent success using oral janus kinase inhibitors, including tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, and baricitinib, have been shown to be efficacious in severe, extensive alopecia areata in adults, but long-term therapy has potential side effects. The durability of response to these medications is variable, and most patients experience recurrence of hair loss after discontinuation. Perhaps topical therapy with these types of drugs may be available in the near future. There is no known effective method of prevention, although the elimination of emotional stress is felt to be helpful. No drugs or hair care products have been associated with the onset of alopecia areata. Although not precisely a treatment, the cosmetic camouflage of alopecia areata is certainly an important consideration in patient management. The damaging emotional effect of significant hair loss for both women and men can be considerable."
What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)?,"'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a disorder that causes a deficiency or absence of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein in the blood. AAT is made in the liver and sent through the bloodstream to the lungs, to protect the lungs from damage. Having low levels of ATT (or no ATT) can allow the lungs to become damaged, making ''breathing'' hard. Age of onset and severity of AATD can vary based on how much ATT an affected person is missing. In adults, symptoms may include ''shortness of breath''; reduced ability to ''exercise''; ''wheezing''; respiratory infections; ''fatigue''; vision problems; and ''weight loss''. Some people have ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') or ''asthma''. Liver disease (''cirrhosis'') may occur in affected children or adults. Rarely, AATD can cause a skin condition called ''panniculitis'"".[1] AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and is inherited in a codominant manner.[2] Treatment is based on each person's symptoms and may include bronchodilators; antibiotics for ""'upper respiratory tract infections''; intravenous therapy of AAT; and/or lung transplantation in severe cases.[1][3]' "
Chart of signs and symptoms of lung and liver disease caused by AATD,"'The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies.''Approximate number of patients (when available)'  "
How common is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. This disorder affects about 1 in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry. It is uncommon in people of Asian descent. Many individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are likely undiagnosed, particularly people with a lung condition called ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD). COPD can be caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; however, the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is often never diagnosed. Some people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are misdiagnosed with ''asthma''.' "
What gene mutations cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"'Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.''The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin. This protein protects the body from being damaged by a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (such as lung tissue) if not carefully controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. Uncontrolled, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli, which can lead to emphysema. The abnormal form of alpha-1 antitrypsin can also accumulate in the liver and may damage this organ.'  "
What tests diagnose AATD?,"'AATD may first be suspected in people with evidence of liver disease at any age, or lung disease (such as emphysema), especially when there is no obvious cause or it is diagnosed at a younger age.''Confirming the diagnosis involves a blood test showing a low serum concentration of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, and either:''Specialists involved in the diagnosis may include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and/or hepatologists (liver specialists).[4]' detecting a functionally deficient AAT protein variant by isoelectric focusing (a method for detecting mutations); or detecting SERPINA1 gene mutations on both copies of the gene with molecular genetic testing. (This confirms the diagnosis when the above-mentioned tests are not performed or their results are not in agreement.)[3]"
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency treatment and management guidelines,"'Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. COPD and other related lung diseases are typically treated with standard therapy.[3][4] Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easier.[4]''Intravenous augmentation therapy (regular infusion of purified, human AAT to increase AAT concentrations) has been recommended for people with established fixed airflow obstruction (determined by a specific lung function test).[3] This therapy raises the level of the AAT protein in the blood and lungs.[4]''Lung transplantation may be an appropriate option for people with end-stage lung disease. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for advanced liver disease.[3]''When present, panniculitis may resolve on its own or after ''dapsone'' or ''doxycycline'' therapy. When this therapy does not help, it has responded to intravenous augmentation therapy in higher than usual doses.[3]''All people with severe AATD should have pulmonary function tests every 6 to 12 months. Those with ATT serum concentrations 10% to 20% of normal should have periodic evaluation of liver function to detect liver disease. People with established liver disease should have periodic ultrasounds of the liver to monitor for fibrotic changes and ''liver cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma'').[3]''Yearly vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus are recommended to lessen the progression of lung disease. Vaccination against ''hepatitis A'' and B is recommended to lessen the risk of liver disease. People with AATD should avoid ''smoking'' and occupations with exposure to environmental pollutants.[3]''Parents, older and younger siblings, and children of a person with severe AATD should be evaluated to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures.[3]' GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.

Alpha Thalassemia Facts*,"'*''Alpha thalassemia'' facts medical author: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD' Alpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of normal hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. There are four types of alpha thalassemia, hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis 
syndrome or Hb Bart syndrome (the more severe form), HbH disease, silent carrier 
state and trait. Alpha thalassemia occurs frequently in people from Mediterranean countries, North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Central Asia. Alpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. People who have alpha thalassemia trait can have mild anemia. However, many people with this type of thalassemia have no signs or symptoms.  Treatments for thalassemias depend on the type and severity of the disorder."
What is alpha thalassemia?,'Alpha thalassemia is a blood disorder that reduces the production of normal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.' 
What are the symptoms of alpha thalassemia?,"""In people with the characteristic features of alpha thalassemia, a reduction in the amount of normal hemoglobin prevents enough oxygen from reaching the body's tissues. Affected individuals also have a shortage of red blood cells (""'anemia''), which can cause ''pale skin'', ''weakness'', ''fatigue'', and more serious complications.'  "
What are the types of alpha thalassemia?,"'Two types of alpha thalassemia can cause health problems. The more severe type is known as hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis syndrome or Hb Bart syndrome. The milder form is called HbH disease.''Hb Bart syndrome'' is characterized by hydrops fetalis, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. Additional signs and symptoms can include severe anemia, an ''enlarged liver'' and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), ''heart'' defects, and abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia. As a result of these serious health problems, most ''babies'' with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth. Hb Bart syndrome can also cause serious complications for women during ''pregnancy'', including dangerously ''high blood pressure'' with swelling (''preeclampsia''), premature delivery, and abnormal bleeding.''HbH disease ''causes mild to moderate anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (''jaundice''). Some affected individuals also have bone changes such as overgrowth of the upper jaw and an unusually prominent forehead. The features of HbH disease usually appear in early childhood, but affected individuals typically live into adulthood.' "
How Common Is Alpha Thalassemia?,"'Alpha thalassemia is a fairly common blood disorder worldwide. Thousands of infants with Hb Bart syndrome and HbH disease are born each year, particularly in Southeast Asia. Alpha thalassemia also occurs frequently in people from Mediterranean countries, North Africa, the Middle East, India, and Central Asia.' "
What Genes Are Related to Alpha Thalassemia,"'Alpha thalassemia typically results from deletions involving the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Both of these genes provide instructions for making a protein called alpha-globin, which is a component (subunit) of hemoglobin.''People have two copies of the HBA1 gene and two copies of the HBA2 gene in each cell. Each copy is called an allele. For each gene, one allele is ''inherited'' from the father, and the other is inherited from the mother. As a result, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin. The different types of alpha thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles.'""Hb Bart syndrome, the most severe form of alpha thalassemia, results from the loss of all four alpha-globin alleles. HbH disease is caused by a loss of three of the four alpha-globin alleles. In these two conditions, a shortage of alpha-globin prevents cells from making normal hemoglobin. Instead, cells produce abnormal forms of hemoglobin called hemoglobin Bart (Hb Bart) or hemoglobin H (HbH). These abnormal hemoglobin molecules cannot effectively carry oxygen to the body's tissues. The substitution of Hb Bart or HbH for normal hemoglobin causes anemia and the other serious health problems associated with alpha thalassemia.""'Two additional variants of alpha thalassemia are related to a reduced amount of alpha-globin. However, cells still produce some normal hemoglobin, these variants tend to cause few or no health problems, and the loss of two of the four alpha-globin alleles results in alpha thalassemia trait. People with alpha thalassemia trait may have unusually small, pale red blood cells and mild anemia. A loss of one alpha-globin allele is found in alpha thalassemia silent carriers. These individuals typically have no thalassemia-related signs or symptoms.' "
How Do People Inherit Alpha Thalassemia?,"'The inheritance of alpha thalassemia is complex. Each person inherits two alpha-globin alleles from each parent. If both parents are missing at least one alpha-globin allele, their children are at risk of having Hb Bart syndrome, HbH disease, or alpha thalassemia trait. The precise risk depends on how many alleles are missing and which combination of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes is affected.' "
What is the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) blood test?,"'The most abundant plasma protein found in the human fetus is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AFP is a protein normally made by the immature ''liver'' cells in the fetus. Healthy, nonpregnant adults have very low levels of AFP in the bloodstream (undetectable to about 10 ng/ml). At birth, infants have relatively high levels of AFP in the blood, which fall to normal low adult levels by the first year of life.''Pregnant'' women carrying ''babies'' with ''neural tube defects'' may have high levels of AFP in both the bloodstream, urine, and in the ''amniotic fluid''. A neural tube defect is an abnormal fetal brain or spinal cord that is caused by ''folic acid'' deficiency during ''pregnancy''. Examples of these ''birth defects'' include ''spina bifida'' and ''anencephaly''. Women carrying twins or other multiples may also have elevated levels of AFP due to the presence of multiple fetuses producing AFP. Lower than normal AFP levels in pregnant women are sometimes seen in pregnant women carrying babies with genetic conditions such as ''Down syndrome''.''It is important to note that abnormal levels of AFP in pregnancy do not necessarily mean there is a problem with the baby. If AFP levels are not normal, it means that more tests should be done to determine the cause. The American Pregnancy Association says that all pregnant women should be offered an AFP test sometime between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. AFP is typically part of the triple screen or quad screen test (along with human chorionic gonadotropin or HCG, estriol, and inhibin A) used in the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy to determine whether additional testing is necessary.''Alpha-fetoprotein is also produced by certain ''cancers'', such as liver or ''testicular cancer'', and is sometimes measured as a ''tumor'' marker (see below).''The AFP tumor marker test can be performed on a blood sample, urine sample, or sample of amniotic fluid.. Other names for the test include total AFP, MSAFP (maternal serum AFP), and alpha-fetoprotein-L3 percent (%)'  "
"In which situations are high blood (serum) levels of AFP used as a tumor 
marker?","'In nonpregnant adults, high blood levels (over 500 nanograms/milliliter [or ng/ml]) of AFP are seen in only a few situations, such as' hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary cancer of the liver; germ cell tumors (a type of cancer of the testes and ovaries, such as embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumors); and ataxia telangiectasia, a severely disabling and rare genetic neurodegenerative disease."
What tests measure AFP?,"'Several assays (tests) for measuring AFP in the blood (serum) are available to laboratories. Generally, normal levels of AFP are below 10 ng/ml. People with various types of acute and chronic liver diseases without documentable ''liver cancer'' can have mild or even moderate elevations of AFP, though usually less than 500 ng/ml.'""The blood sample for an AFP test can be obtained in any doctor's office or clinic where blood samples are drawn. The sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis."" "
What is the sensitivity of AFP for diagnosing liver cancer?,"'Primary liver ''cancer'', or hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma, is more common in some forms of chronic ''liver disease''. As a screening test in patients with chronic ''hepatitis B'' and C, or ''hemochromatosis'', AFP has a sensitivity for liver ''cancer'' of about 70%. In other words, an elevated AFP blood test is seen in about 70% people with primary liver cancer. That leaves about 30% of patients in these high-risk groups who can have liver cancer but have normal AFP levels. Consequently, the test is not diagnostic but is an indicator of a potential situation. Therefore, a normal AFP does not exclude liver cancer. For example, AFP levels are normal in a patient with fibrolamellar carcinoma, a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma.''As noted above, an abnormal AFP does not mean that an individual has liver cancer. It is important to note, however, that people with ''cirrhosis'' (scarring) of the liver and an abnormal AFP, despite having no evidence of liver cancer, still are at very high risk of developing liver cancer. Thus, anyone with ''cirrhosis'' and an elevated AFP, particularly with steadily rising blood levels, will either most likely develop liver cancer or actually already have an undiscovered liver cancer.''An AFP greater than 500 ng/ml is very suggestive of liver cancer. In fact, the blood level of AFP loosely relates to (correlates with) the size of the liver cancer.''Finally, in patients with liver cancer and abnormal AFP levels, the AFP may be used as a marker of response to treatment. For example, an elevated AFP is expected to fall to normal in a patient whose liver cancer is successfully removed surgically (resected). If AFP then increases again, liver cancer recurrence is likely.''In certain cancers of the testis as described above, the AFP is measured at diagnosis and followed as a tumor marker in a fashion similar to that described above in people with liver cancer.''AFP is not recommended as a screening tool for detection of cancer in normal, healthy people.' "
What is Alport syndrome?,"'Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by ''kidney disease'', ''hearing loss'', and eye abnormalities.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Alport syndrome?,"'People with Alport syndrome experience progressive loss of kidney function. Almost all affected individuals have blood in their urine (hematuria), which indicates abnormal functioning of the kidneys. Many people with Alport syndrome also develop high levels of protein in their urine (''proteinuria''). The kidneys become less able to function as this condition progresses, resulting in ''end-stage renal disease'' (''ESRD'').''People with Alport syndrome frequently develop sensorineural ''hearing'' loss, which is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear, during late childhood or early adolescence. Affected individuals may also have misshapen lenses in the eyes (anterior lenticonus) and abnormal coloration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (''retina''). These eye abnormalities seldom lead to ''vision loss''.''Significant hearing loss, eye abnormalities, and progressive kidney disease are more common in males with Alport syndrome than in affected females.' "
How common is Alport syndrome?,"'Alport syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns.' "
What genes are related to Alport syndrome?,"'Mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes cause Alport syndrome. These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type IV collagen. This protein plays an important role in the kidneys, specifically in structures called glomeruli. Glomeruli are clusters of specialized blood vessels that remove water and waste products from blood and create urine. Mutations in these genes result in abnormalities of the type IV collagen in glomeruli, which prevents the kidneys from properly filtering the blood and allows blood and protein to pass into the urine. Gradual scarring of the kidneys occurs, eventually leading to ''kidney failure'' in many people with Alport syndrome.''Type IV collagen is also an important component of inner ear structures, particularly the organ of Corti, that transform sound waves into nerve impulses for the brain. Alterations in type IV collagen often result in abnormal inner ear function, which can lead to hearing loss. In the eye, this protein is important for maintaining the shape of the ''lens'' and the normal color of the retina. Mutations that disrupt type IV collagen can result in misshapen lenses and an abnormally colored retina.' "
How do people inherit Alport syndrome?,"'Alport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. About 80 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene and are inherited in an X-linked pattern. This gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the COL4A5 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause kidney failure and other severe symptoms of the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one copy of the COL4A5 gene usually only results in hematuria, but some women experience more severe symptoms. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.''In approximately 15 percent of cases, Alport syndrome results from mutations in both copies of the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The parents of an individual with the autosomal recessive form of this condition each have one copy of the mutated gene and are called carriers. Some carriers are unaffected and others develop a less severe condition called thin basement membrane nephropathy, which is characterized by hematuria.''Alport syndrome has autosomal dominant inheritance in about 5 percent of cases. People with this form of Alport syndrome have one mutation in either the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene in each cell. It remains unclear why some individuals with one mutation in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene have autosomal dominant Alport syndrome and others have thin basement membrane nephropathy.' "

MS vs. ALS differences,"  ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig’s disease) and MS (multiple sclerosis) are not the same disease. They sometimes are confused because they have some similarities. However, they have more differences than similarities. MS is neurodegenerative disease that results in the destruction the protective coating (myelin sheath) on nerves of the CNS (central nervous system), which causes a faulty relay of instructions from the brain to the body. Many people may have mild symptoms for years with periods of remission. In contrast, ALS destroys the nerve cells (neurons) so that the body cannot communicate with the brain. Symptoms of ALS progress continually, and result in paralysis, and death a few years after the initial diagnosis. The similarities between these two conditions are that both MS and ALS are so-called neurodegenerative diseases that affect the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system or CNS). Both affect the body's muscles and nerves. ALS and MS have no known cure."
What are the main differences between MS vs. ALS,"  Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, while ALS is hereditary in 1 out of 10 people due to a mutated protein. MS has more mental impairment and ALS has more physical impairment. Late stage MS rarely is debilitating or fatal, while ALS is completely debilitating leading to paralysis and death. The age of diagnosis of MS usually is between age 20 and 50; rarely, it can occur in children and teens. MS is more common in women and ALS is more common in men."
What are the differences between the symptoms and signs of MS vs. ALS?," Numbness and tingling in the body Vision problems Sexual dysfunction Bowel problems Depression Mood swings Fatigue, often when warming up to exercise Slowed or fuzzy memory (cognitive problems) Mild problems walking Periods with few symptoms followed by relapses Muscle cramps Trips and falls easily Clumsiness Problems holding the head up"
What are the similarities between signs and symptoms of MS vs. ALS?,"'Some of the signs and ''symptoms of MS'' and ALS are similar, and include:' Fatigue Difficulty walking Involuntary muscle spasms Muscle weakness Slurred speech or difficulty swallowing (less frequent for multiple sclerosis) No known cure"
What are the causes of MS vs. ALS?,"'ALS is not considered an autoimmune disease, although some researchers theorize that it might be, due in part, to a disorganized immune response. Hereditary factors such as genes are thought to play a significant role in some patients because about one of every 10 patients has ''inherited'"" the disease. However, nine of 10 patients seem to have a spontaneous mutation in their genes that causes production of an unusual protein (ubiquilin2) that is speculated to play a significant role in the cause of the disease. Scientists don't know what triggers the onset of ALS. However, researchers suggest that a chemical imbalance (high levels of glutamate, a chemical messenger) also may play a role in causing the disease. In addition, researchers have noticed that members of the military have a much higher rate of ALS than the non-military population, but the cause of this statistical finding is unknown.""'MS is considered to be an autoimmune disease, although we do not know what triggers it. However, we know what occurs in the body. The body perceives myelin (a substance that coats nerve cells that allows them to function optimally) as a foreign substance and begins to destroy it. This results in intermittent and/or poor functionality of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, that in turn, cause ''MS symptoms''.' "
Do MS and ALS have the same risk factors?,"'Age is risk factor for both ALS and MS, but ALS usually is diagnosed in older individuals (aged about 40 to 70), with an average age of onset of 55. While MS is diagnosed in a younger population (aged 20 to 50).''ALS is more common in men by about 20%, while MS is about 2 to 3 times more likely to develop in women.''Heredity plays a significant role in some individuals that develop ALS (about 10%). MS is not considered to be a hereditary disease, but new data may modify this conclusion.''In addition, being a member of the military raises the risk (twice as likely) of developing ALS. However, military service is not considered a risk factor for MS.''If you have an identical twin with MS, there is a 30% chance for you to develop MS.' "
How are MS vs. ALS  diagnosed?,"'If the history, symptoms, and physical exam suggest that ALS is a possible diagnosis, the patient is usually referred to a ''neurologist'' and given an ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') to test muscle and nerve function. If these functions are not normal, an ''MRI'' of the spinal cord and brain is typically ordered. Some patients will also have a ''spinal tap'' and blood tests to help exclude other diseases. The diagnosis of ALS is by exclusion. This means that ALS is diagnosed after other possible diseases have been ruled out. A neurology consultant specialist usually does this diagnosis.''The same methods are used to diagnose MS. Moreover, like ALS, ''multiple sclerosis'' is a diagnosis of exclusion (proving that other conditions are not the cause of symptoms). However, MS has two additional diagnostic components that most neurologists to diagnose MS. The first is evidence of damage in the central nervous system in two separate areas (for example, ''MRI'' findings of damage in the brain, spinal cord, and/or ''optic nerve''), and the evidence that the damage occurred at two different points in time.''Treatments for ALS cannot reverse the nerve damage, but they can only slow progression of disease. The US FDA has approved two ''drugs'' for the treatment of ALS-''riluzole'' (''Rilutek'') and edaravone (Radicava).''MS treatment is not a cure for ''multiple sclerosis''. Treatments may help speed recovery from an MS exacerbation of symptoms and may slow the progression of the disease. Although a few patients may have mild symptoms, and not require treatment. Treatments for MS attacks can include ''corticosteroids'' and plasma exchange (plasmapheresis, in which the liquid portion of your blood is removed, treated, and returned to the body). For progressive recurrent MS, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved therapy. There are a number of other drugs for relapsing-remitting MS that may be prescribed by a neurologist to help reduce symptoms.''Treatment protocols for ALS and MS are best determined by your individual situation. Treatments are best determined in consultation with your primary care physician and a consultant such as a neurologist.' "

In contrast, the life expectancy of a person with ALS is only about 2 to 5 years after the time of diagnosis, although about 20% may live somewhat longer than five years.

What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.'

Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is complementary or alternative treatment or CAM?,"'CAM (''complementary and alternative medicine'') is care provided in addition (integrative medicine) to or instead of traditional or standard medical practices. This group of therapies is wide-ranging, and includes:'""Some people who seek out alternative medicine feel that conventional therapy has not successfully controlled their symptoms, or that the potential side effects associated with traditional therapy aren't acceptable. Others find that adding complementary medicine to their program allows improved control of symptoms. ""'When complementary medicine is added to traditional routes, it is referred to as integrative medicine.''Recent studies through the US Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC), specifically the National Health Interview Survey, suggest that as many as 38% of residents within the United States seek out CAM.'""Many therapies that are considered within the group of complementary and alternative medicines haven't been studied extensively or investigated in comparison to conventional treatment options.""  acupuncture,  herbal supplements,  dietary 
modifications,  magnets,  reflexology, and  much more.

What is of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a disease that causes ''demyelination'"" of the brain and spinal cord, or a loss of the covering around axons. When this occurs, the axons (the parts of the nerve cells that transmit impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas of the central nervous system are affected by the loss of myelin, different symptoms develop. "" "
What are the symptoms of MS?,"'The ''specific symptom seen in ''MS'' is related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Examples of symptoms of MS include: '   a numbness, burning ors tingling feeling, or weakness in certain areas of 
	the body; the weakness might be mild or severe enough to cause paralysis of 
	one side of the body; bladder and bowel symptoms such as incontinence, difficulty in starting 
	to urinate, a strong and/or frequent urge to urinate, even loss of control of 
	the bladder or an inability to empty the bladder; eye problems such as eye discomfort, double vision, uncontrollable eye 
	movements, optic neuritis, and vision loss; difficulty moving the arms or legs, difficulty walking, or problems with 
	coordination and fine motor skills; 
	sexual problems 
	in men and a 
	
	vaginal dryness (decrease in vaginal 
	lubrication in women); Nerve and brain problems such as dizziness, depression, memory loss, 
	balance problems, poor judgment, and memory loss; and  as MS progresses, some patients are left with muscle spasticity, which is an 
involuntary painful contraction of some muscles. "
What alternative treatments can be used for MS symptoms?,"'Fatigue'' and spasticity seem to respond best to CAM. ''Therapies that have been shown to be of some benefit for fatigue have included:''Spasticity has reportedly been reduced with the use of acupuncture and massage therapy. A sense of tingling (paresthesias) have been reportedly improved with reflexology.''Symptoms including ''depression'', memory loss, ''urinary incontinence'', and progression of MS itself (including relapses, disease extent as measured on ''MRI''), and disability have had limited improvement when treated with CAM. ''Therapies tested in an effort to improve these symptoms have included:''None of these treatments led to any significant benefit in the studied symptoms.'  exercise, for example, yoga, ,swimming, walking, and other types of 
	regular exercise; magnet therapy; and  gingko biloba 
supplements.  a

What about medical marijuana (cannabis) for MS symptoms?,"'There have been a number of studies looking at the potential benefits of medical marijuana (cannabis) on MS symptoms, including spasticity and ''chronic pain''. There is some suggestion that FDA approved forms of medical cannabis (Marinol or Sativex) may be beneficial in improving spasticity or bladder frequency. However, there are no reports that ingested or inhaled medical marijuana is beneficial for conditions associated with MS. The''National Multiple Sclerosis Society'' has more information about medical marijuana for ''MS symptoms'' (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines/Marijuana)' "
Who is eligible to pursue treatment with CAM?,"'Anyone can participate CAM therapy. However, it is important to recognize that most of these therapies are not covered by insurance, and may be an ""out of pocket"" cost for patients with MS.''Patients who decide to pursue CAM need to share this information with their physicians, as some supplements may interact with convention medication and lead to side effects.' "
How much does CAM cost?,"'The costs of CAM can vary widely; regular exercise and yoga can be low or no-cost options, while massage therapy, acupuncture, and some supplements can be quite expensive. Every patient must have a good relationship with treating health-care professionals of traditional and non-traditional therapies to best understand potential costs.' "
What are the potential risks and side effects of CAM?,"'Side effects of CAM vary depending on the treatment.''It is important to discuss any potential or ongoing use of CAM with your health-care professional, who may need to adjust your current therapies to prevent any adverse effects caused by interactions between the two types of therapies.'

Introduction to menopause and hot flashes,"'Women frequently ask what symptoms they can anticipate during menopause. In reality, each woman experiences menopause differently. Some women have changes in several areas of their lives. It is not always possible to tell if these changes are related to ''aging'', menopause or both. While one woman is certain that ''insomnia'' is a menopause symptom for her, another feels joint aches are her primary menopause symptom. Doctors find it difficult to communicate to their patients about menopause and what could be a host of uncomfortable symptoms. For example, medical science cannot explain how declining hormone levels during menopause could cause ''joint pain''.'""Menopause is not an illness, but a natural transition when a woman's reproductive ability ends. Yet many of the menopausal symptoms may mimic signs caused by diseases. When do women undergoing menopause need treatment in the first place? The same pattern of hot flashes in two women can have a very different psychological impact. For one woman, they can greatly disturb her daily functioning, while another may hardly be bothered."" "
What are hot flashes?,"'Hot flashes are experienced by many women, but not all women undergoing menopause have this experience. A hot flash is a feeling of warmth that spreads over the body, but is often most strongly felt in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes may be accompanied by perspiration or flushing. On average, they usually last from 30 seconds to several minutes. Although the exact cause of hot flashes is not fully understood, they are thought to be due to a combination of hormonal and biochemical fluctuations brought on by declining estrogen levels. What is known is they can vary in severity, frequency, and duration.''""About 70 percent of women experience hot flashes, but their underlying physiology isn\'t well understood,"" said Rebecca Thurston, an assistant professor of psychiatry, psychology, and epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. ''Sometimes hot flashes are accompanied by ''night sweats'' (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime). This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing ''sleep'' and daytime ''tiredness''. '  "
How are hot flashes usually treated?,"'Traditionally, hot flashes have been treated with oral (by mouth) or transdermal (patch) forms of estrogen. ''Hormone therapy'' (HT), also referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'') or ''postmenopausal'' hormone therapy (PHT), consists of estrogens or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). Oral and transdermal estrogen are available as estrogen alone or estrogen combined with progesterone. Whether oral or transdermal, all available prescription ''estrogen replacement'' medications are effective in reducing hot flash frequency and severity.''However, long-term studies (NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving oral preparations of combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive HT. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for ''heart'' attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.'""The decision in regard to starting or continuing hormone therapy, therefore, is a very individual choice in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and treatment benefits, plus each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time.""  "
Which alternative prescription medications are effective in treating hot flash symptoms of menopause?,"'A few prescription medications, in addition to estrogen, can provide relief for hot flashes. While none of these ''drugs'' is as effective as estrogen, studies show that non-estrogen drugs may have up to 70% of the effectiveness of estrogen therapy when treating hot flashes.' Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): This class of medication is used to treat depression and anxiety. In clinical studies, however, low doses of SSRIs and SNRIs have been shown to be effective in decreasing menopausal hot flashes. The SNRI that has been tested most extensively is venlafaxine (Effexor), although there is also evidence showing that the SSRIs paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil CR) and fluoxetine (Prozac) can be effective in controlling hot flashes. Clonidine: Clonidine (Catapres) acts in the brain to decrease blood pressure. It has a long history of being used for blood pressure control, but it has potentially annoying side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, or difficulty sleeping. Clonidine effectively relieves hot flashes in some women but is completely ineffective in others. Clonidine is available in pill or patch form. Megestrol acetate (Megace): This medication is a type of progesterone, a female hormone. It can be effective in relieving hot flashes, but can only be taken over the short term (for several months). Serious effects can occur if the medication is abruptly discontinued, and megestrol is not usually recommended as a first-line drug to treat hot flashes. Megestrol use can also lead to weight gain. Studies of another form of progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera), which is administered by injection, has also been useful in treating hot flashes. This drug can be used long-term but may have side effects that include weight gain and bone loss. Gabapentin: Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a drug that is primarily used for the treatment of seizures that appears to be moderately effective in treating hot flashes. The drug is well tolerated by most women, but often causes drowsiness."
Why are some doctors reluctant to recommend nonprescription therapies for menopause symptoms?,"'Nonprescription products such as herbal ''supplements'' are not controlled by the FDA because they are considered food ''supplements'' by law. Because they are not regulated like prescription medications, their ingredients and potency vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and even from bottle to bottle from the same manufacturer. Also, careful testing and proof of safety is not required as it is with prescription medications. (The only way the FDA can recall a nonprescription product is by proving that it is dangerous.) Furthermore, there are so many nonprescription products available that a doctor cannot possibly know exactly what is in each preparation. Moreover, not one of these products has been scientifically proven to be safe or effective.''So, how well have the nonprescription alternatives to hormone therapy been tested? Not one study has adhered to all of the stringent requirements that are necessary for approval of prescription medicines. '   Specifically, sugar pills (placebos) have not been included in many studies of nonprescription alternative medications. Therefore, it is not possible to know if the product worked at all, since any effects seen with the product might have been seen with a placebo.  Many studies evaluated women who were taking products without supervision. Obviously, these women were aware that they were taking something to improve their symptoms. Thus, the element of objectivity was eliminated, and bias was introduced. Most available studies have been carried out for only a few months. Physicians do not want to recommend a product that hasn't been proven safe over the long-term.  Lastly, each study seems to have a different way of judging whether the medication helps. Some analyze hot flashes alone, while others evaluate a group of symptoms without specifically segregating out hot flashes. Other studies examine multiple but individual symptoms. Even the studies that evaluate hot flashes may record different factors; the number of hot flashes per day, the severity of the hot flashes, or the duration of the hot flashes, etc. "
What alternative treatments for menopause have been scientifically studied?,"'The alternative treatments for menopause that have been studied in well-designed trials include phytoestrogens (plant estrogens, isoflavones), black cohosh, and vitamin E.''Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants (such as chick peas and lentils) that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. ''Red clover'' is another source of isoflavones that has been used by some women in an attempt to relieve hot flashes. Isoflavones have a chemical structure that is similar to the estrogens naturally produced by the body, but their effectiveness as an estrogen has been estimated to be much lower than true estrogens.''Some studies have shown that these compounds may help relieve hot flashes and other ''symptoms of menopause''. In particular, women who have had ''breast cancer'' and do not want to take hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen sometimes use soy products for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, some phytoestrogens can actually have anti-estrogenic properties in certain situations, and the overall risks of these preparations have not yet been determined. There is some concern because of the fact that these products are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), that phytoestrogens may stimulate breast ''cancer'' growth or limit the antitumor effects of ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''). Data are conflicting in this regard, and it is important for women to understand that the long-term risks and potential effects of phytoestrogens have not been fully characterized. For example, researchers have shown that long-term use of phytoestrogens in postmenopausal women led to an increase in endometrial hyperplasia (overgrowth of the tissues lining the uterus) which can be a precursor to ''cancer''.''There is a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" remedies and therefore safer than HT, but their safety has never been proven scientifically. Further research is needed to fully characterize the safety and potential risks of phytoestrogens.''Black cohosh is an herbal preparation that has been popular in Europe for hot flash relief. This herb is becoming more popular in the U.S., and the North American Menopause Society does support the short-term use of black cohosh for treating menopausal symptoms. The recommended use is up to six months because of its relatively low incidence of side effects. Some studies have shown that black cohosh can reduce hot flashes, but most of the studies have not been considered to be rigorous enough in their design to firmly prove any benefit. The Herbal Alternatives for Menopause Trial (HALT) study, a one-year study described below, failed to establish any benefit of black cohosh in the treatment of hot flashes. There have also not been scientific studies done to establish the long-term benefits and safety of this product. Research is ongoing to further determine the effectiveness and safety of black cohosh. There is some concern about the potential estrogenic effect of black cohosh on the breast, and it is not recommended as a safe therapy for women with breast cancer or who are at high risk for breast cancer.''The Herbal Alternatives for Menopause Trial (HALT) was a one-year study carried out with 351 peri- or postmenopausal women experiencing hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. The women were randomly assigned to receive one of five treatments: black cohosh alone, a multibotanical regimen that included black cohosh (and other herbal ingredients such as ''ginseng'' and ''dong quai''), the multibotanical regimen plus dietary soy counseling, conjugated estrogen 0.625 mg (with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate), or placebo. After one year of therapy, conjugated estrogen reduced hot flashes more than placebo, but there was no significant reduction in the frequency or severity of hot flashes with black cohosh or with any of the herbal interventions when compared to placebo at any of the follow-up times.''Some women report that vitamin E supplements can provide relief from mild hot flashes, but scientific studies are lacking to prove the effectiveness of vitamin E in relieving hot flashes. Taking a dosage greater than 400 international units (IU) of Vitamin E may not be safe, since some studies have suggested that greater dosages may be associated with ''cardiovascular disease'' risk.''There are many supplements and substances, including ginseng; ''licorice''; ''evening primrose oil''; dong quai; chasteberry; and ''wild yam'', that have been advertised as ""natural"" treatments for menopause. Scientific studies have not been performed to prove the safety and effectiveness of these products, although the HALT study (see black cohosh, previously) showed that ginseng and dong quai were no more effective than placebo in the treatment of hot flashes.''The North American Menopause Society recommends that women try behavioral modifications such as attempting to keep the core body temperature cooler to help relieve hot flashes. Other modifications include regular ''exercise'', ''yoga'' and meditation. Several studies have failed to prove a beneficial effect of ''exercise'' on hot flashes, possibly because exercise raises core body temperature and may, in fact, trigger hot flashes. Still, regular exercise has important benefits in the ''prevention'' of ''obesity'', cardiovascular disease, ''diabetes'', and other conditions.''Relaxation therapy and ''stress management'' interventions do not appear to be effective in the management of hot flashes, according to scientific studies. However, these interventions may be beneficial for women in maintaining overall health, physical well-being, and emotional well-being during the menopausal transition.' "
What is dry socket?,"'The typical scenario for dry socket is the occurrence of throbbing ''pain'' about two to four days after the tooth is extracted. Dry socket ''pain'' is often accompanied by ''bad breath'' and a foul taste in the mouth. With this onset of pain, it is obvious that proper healing has been interrupted.''Dry socket is a condition in which there is inflammation of the jawbone (or alveolar bone) after a tooth extraction. It is also referred to as ""alveolar osteitis"" and is one of the many complications that can occur from a tooth extraction. The occurrence of dry socket is relatively rare, occurring in about 2% of tooth extractions. However, that percentage rises to at least 20% when it involves the removal of mandibular impacted third molars (lower ''wisdom teeth'').' "
What causes dry socket?,"'A dry socket is caused by the partial or total loss of a ''blood clot'' in the tooth socket after a tooth extraction. Normally, after a tooth is extracted, a ''blood clot'' will form as the first step in healing to cover and protect the underlying jawbone. If the blood clot is lost or does not form, the bone is exposed and healing is delayed.''In general, a dry socket is a result of bacterial, chemical, mechanical, and physiologic factors. Below are examples for each:' Bacterial: Preexisting infection that is present in the mouth prior to a dental extraction such as periodontal disease (or periodontitis) can prevent proper formation of a blood clot. Certain oral bacteria can cause the breakdown of the clot. Chemical: Nicotine used by smokers causes a decrease in the blood supply in the mouth. As a result, the blood clot may fail to form at the site of a recent tooth extraction. Mechanical: Sucking through a straw, aggressive rinsing, spitting, or dragging on a cigarette causes dislodgement and loss of the blood clot. Physiologic: Hormones, dense jawbone, or poor blood supply are factors that prevent blood clot formation."
What are risk factors for getting dry socket?,"'Prior to a tooth extraction, risk factors for developing a dry socket include ''smoking'', presence of impacted wisdom tooth, being female, and being above the age of 30.''Smoking'' is a risk factor for developing a dry socket due to the nicotine found in cigarettes. Exposure to nicotine reduces the blood supply available to the healing socket and can prevent the proper formation of a blood clot at the extraction site.''Extraction of impacted third molars (''wisdom teeth'') can be traumatic as some surrounding gum tissue and jawbone may need to be removed or may be adversely affected during surgery. Although the extraction is necessary, the resulting ''trauma'' can increase the chances of dry socket.''Previous infections such as periodontal disease or ''pericoronitis'' at the site of the extraction can predispose an individual to dry socket.''Women have been found to develop a dry socket more so than men. This may be related to hormonal factors such as use of ''oral contraceptives'"" or normal hormonal changes during a woman's cycle.""'Patients older than 30 years of age with impacted third molars have an increased risk of dry socket. With age, the jawbone becomes more dense and has less blood supply available. A dense jawbone increases the risk of a traumatic extraction and less blood supply decreases the chances of blood clot formation and timely healing.' "
What are dry socket symptoms and signs?,'A tell-tale sign is a socket that has a partial or total loss of a blood clot. The jawbone may be visible in the socket and the surrounding tissue may appear gray due to poor healing.''Symptoms of a dry socket include a throbbing steady pain that presents a few days after a tooth extraction. The pain may radiate to other parts of the head such as the ears and eyes on the same side of the face. ''Bad breath'' and a bad taste may also be present due to the accumulation of food debris and bacteria in the socket.'  
How is dry socket diagnosed?,"""Diagnosis of a dry socket is based on history of dental treatment, clinical examination, and the individual's symptoms. Timing of when symptoms begin may be an indicator for a dry socket. During normal healing, the discomfort of an extraction should lessen over time. However, if the pain increases, this is an indication that healing is delayed and could possibly be due to a dry socket. Typically, symptoms for a dry socket develop two to four days after a tooth extraction. Most dry sockets happen within the first week after tooth extraction."" "
What is the treatment for dry socket?,"'Treatment usually involves symptomatic support while the socket heals. Initially, the dentist will gently irrigate to clear the socket of food debris. Next, an analgesic medicated dressing or packing is placed within the socket to cover the exposed bone. This usually provides immediate relief. This dressing may need to be replaced every few days during the healing process. The dressing is often coated with ""dry socket paste,"" which is made up of ingredients with pain-relieving properties, including eugenol (clove oil).''Additionally, medications can be prescribed to manage the pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (such as ''Advil'' or ''Aleve'') or narcotics (such as ''hydrocodone/acetaminophen'' [''Vicodin'']) are often used to relieve pain.'  "
Are there home remedies for dry socket?,"'Home treatment for a dry socket usually involves temporary management of pain until a dental professional can be seen for treatment. Methods to provide some relief include use of ''over-the-counter'' pain medications for ''pain management'', ''cold'' compress, or insulated ice pack on the affected side of face (15 minutes on and 15 minutes off), rinsing with saltwater to remove food debris and use of clove oil (place a one to two drops of clove oil on a clean cotton swab and gently apply to the affected area). Again, these methods are only for temporary relief of pain. Delaying a follow-up visit with the dentist or surgeon could prolong the pain as well as the recovery time.' "
What is the average healing time for dry socket?,"'Average healing time is seven to 10 days, as this is the amount of time it takes for new tissue to grow to cover the exposed socket.'  "
What is the prognosis for dry socket?,"'Prognosis is good as there usually are no long-term consequences. Once the tissue is able to cover the bone, the healing will progress normally.' "
Is it possible to prevent dry socket?,"'The ''prevention'' of developing a dry socket may be influenced by the methods used by the dentist or surgeon performing the tooth extraction. Such preventive methods include (1) placement of a packing at surgery with or without antibiotic (for example, ''tetracycline'') and/or (2) placement of ''sutures'' to protect the blood clot. These details can be discussed with the dentist or surgeon prior to the procedure to determine if these preventive methods would be recommended.''After extraction, there are a few day-to-day activities that should be avoided: ''smoking'', drinking with a straw, and vigorous spitting or rinsing. ''Diet'' should be a soft food ''diet''. The area should be kept as clean as possible with gentle rinsing with an antibacterial solution such as chlorhexidine rinse (''Peridex''). This oral rinse can be prescribed by your surgeon. It is important to follow any special instructions given by the dentist or surgeon in caring for the extraction site at home.''Lastly, recent studies have shown that the incidence of dry socket with women is significantly decreased when tooth extractions are performed during their ''menstrual period'' (menses). When ''teeth'' extractions can be electively planned, the recommendation is to perform this procedure during the menstrual period. In this way, the risk of dry socket due to cycle-related hormonal changes can be eliminated.' "
What is Alzheimer's disease?,"""Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive disease of the brain that is characterized by impairment of memory and eventually by disturbances in reasoning, planning, language, and perception. Many scientists believe that Alzheimer's disease results from an increase in the production or accumulation of a specific protein (beta-amyloid protein) in the brain that leads to nerve cell death.""""The likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease increases substantially after the age of 70 and may affect 38% of persons over the age of 85. Nonetheless, Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of ""'aging'"" and is not something that inevitably happens in later life. For example, many people live to over 100 years of age and never develop Alzheimer's disease."" "
What's the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia?,"'Dementia is a syndrome characterized by:''Although some kinds of ''memory loss'' are normal parts of ''aging'"", the changes due to aging are not severe enough to interfere with the level of function. Although many different diseases can cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause for dementia in the United States and in most countries in the world.""   impairment in memory, impairment in another area of thinking such as the ability to organize thoughts and reason, the ability to use language, or the ability to see accurately the visual world (not because of eye disease), and these impairments are severe enough to cause a decline in the patient's usual level of functioning."
Who's at risk for getting Alzheimer's disease?,"""The main risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is increased age. As a population ages, the frequency of Alzheimer's disease continues to increase. Fifteen percent of people over 65 years of age and 50% of those over 85 years of age have Alzheimer's disease. Unless new treatments are developed to decrease the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease, the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease in the United States is expected to be 13.8 million by the year 2050.""""There are also genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Most people develop Alzheimer's disease after age 70. However, less than 10% of people develop the disease in the fourth or fifth decade of life (40s or 50s). At least half of these early onset patients have ""'inherited'"" gene mutations associated with their Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the children of a patient with early onset Alzheimer's disease who has one of these gene mutations has a 50% risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.""'Common forms of certain genes increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\'s disease, but do not invariably cause Alzheimer\'s disease. The best-studied ""risk"" gene is the one that encodes apolipoprotein E (apoE).'""This means that in majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease, no genetic risk factor has yet been found. Most experts do not recommend that adult children of patients with Alzheimer's disease should have genetic testing for the apoE4 gene since there is no treatment for Alzheimer's disease. When medical treatments that prevent or decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease become available, genetic testing may be recommended for adult children of patients with Alzheimer's disease so that they may be treated.""""Many, but not all, studies have found that women have a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease than men. It is certainly true that women live longer than men, but age alone does not seem to explain the increased frequency in women. The apparent increased frequency of Alzheimer's disease in women has led to considerable research about the role of estrogen in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that estrogen should not be prescribed to post-menopausal women for the purpose of decreasing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, the role of estrogen in Alzheimer's disease remains an area of research focus.""""Other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include:""""Some studies have found that Alzheimer's disease occurs more often among people who suffered significant traumatic head injuries earlier in life, particularly among those with the apoE4 gene.""""In the majority of Alzheimer's disease cases, however, no specific genetic risks have yet been identified."" The apoE gene has three different forms (alleles) -- apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. The apoE4 form of the gene has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in most (but not all) populations studied. The frequency of the apoE4 version of the gene in the general population varies, but is always less than 30% and frequently 8% to 14%. People with one copy of the E4 gene usually have about a two- to three-fold increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Persons with two copies of the E4 gene (usually around 1% of the population) have about a nine-fold increase in risk. Nonetheless, even persons with two copies of the E4 gene don't always get Alzheimer's disease. At least one copy of the E4 gene is found in 40% of patients with sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease. High blood pressure (hypertension) Heart disease Diabetes Possibly elevated blood cholesterol Individuals who have completed less than eight years of education also have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. These factors increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but by no means do they mean that Alzheimer's disease is inevitable in persons with these factors. A majority of people with Down syndrome will develop the brain changes of Alzheimer's disease by 40 years of age. This fact was also a clue to the ""amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease"" Some studies have found that Alzheimer's disease occurs more often among people who suffered significant traumatic head injuries earlier in life, particularly among those with the apoE4 gene."
Ten warning signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease,"""The following list of warning signs include common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Individuals who exhibit several of these symptoms should see a physician for a complete evaluation.""""It is normal for certain kinds of memory, such as the ability to remember lists of words, to decline with normal aging. In fact, normal individuals 50 years of age will recall only about 60% as many items on some kinds of memory tests as individuals 20 years of age. Furthermore, everyone forgets, and every 20 year old is well aware of multiple times he or she couldn't think of an answer on a test that he or she once knew. Almost no 20 year old worries when he/she forgets something, that he/she has the 'early stages of Alzheimer's disease,' whereas an individual 50 or 60 years of age with a few memory lapses may worry that they have the 'early stages of Alzheimer's disease.""   Memory loss (forgetting important dates or events) Difficulty performing familiar tasks (problems remembering the rules to a favorite game or driving to a familiar place) Problems talking with others or writing (For example, a person may struggle to find the right words for items or names of people or places.) Disorientation to time and place (for example, forgetting where they are, loosing track of the seasons, dates, and passage of time) Poor or decreased judgment (for example, poor hygiene or poor judgment when dealing with money or financial matters) Vision problems (problems reading or judging distances) Problems with solving problems or planning (for example, problems tracking regular bills or following familiar recipes) Misplacing things (for example, a person put items in unusual places and then are not able to retrace their steps find them again) Changes in mood, personality, or behavior Loss of initiative or withdrawal from social or work activities"
What are the stages of Alzheimer's disease?,"'The onset of Alzheimer\'s disease is usually gradual, and it is slowly progressive. Memory problems that family members initially dismiss as ""a normal part of aging"" are in retrospect noted by the family to be the first stages of Alzheimer\'s disease. When memory and other problems with thinking start to consistently affect the usual level of functioning; families begin to suspect that something more than ""normal aging"" is going on.''Problems of memory, particularly for recent events (''short-term memory'"") are common early in the course of Alzheimer's disease. For example, the individual may, on repeated occasions, forget to turn off an iron or fail to recall which of the morning's medicines were taken. Mild personality changes, such as less spontaneity, apathy, and a tendency to withdraw from social interactions, may occur early in the illness.""""As the disease progresses, problems in abstract thinking and in other intellectual functions develop. The person may begin to have trouble with figures when working on bills, with understanding what is being read, or with organizing the day's work. Further disturbances in behavior and appearance may also be seen at this point, such as agitation, irritability, quarrelsomeness, and a diminishing ability to dress appropriately.""'Later in the course of the disorder, affected individuals may become confused or disoriented about what month or year it is, be unable to describe accurately where they live, or be unable to name a place being visited. Eventually, patients may wander, be unable to engage in conversation, erratic in mood, uncooperative, and lose bladder and bowel control. In late stages of the disease, persons may become totally incapable of caring for themselves. Death can then follow, perhaps from ''pneumonia'' or some other problem that occurs in severely deteriorated states of health. Those who develop the disorder later in life more often die from other illnesses (such as ''heart disease'"") rather than as a consequence of Alzheimer's disease.""  "
What causes Alzheimer's disease?,"'The cause(s) of '""Alzheimer's disease""' is (are) not known. The ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" is the most widely discussed and researched hypothesis about the cause of '""Alzheimer's disease""'. The strongest data supporting the amyloid cascade hypothesis comes from the study of early-onset inherited (genetic) '""Alzheimer's"""" disease. Mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease have been found in about half of the patients with early-onset disease. In all of these patients, the mutation leads to excess production in the brain of a specific form of a small protein fragment called ABeta (Aβ). Many scientists believe that in the majority of sporadic (for example, non-inherited) cases of Alzheimer's disease (these make up the vast majority of all cases of Alzheimer's disease) there is too little removal of this Aβ protein rather than too much production. In any case, much of the research in finding ways to prevent or slow down Alzheimer's disease has focused on ways to decrease the amount of Aβ in the brain."" "
How Is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?,"""No specific blood test or imaging test exists for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed when:""'Ten other causes of dementia are:'""Because many other disorders can be confused with Alzheimer's disease, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is essential in arriving at a correct diagnosis. Such an assessment should include at least three major components; 1) a thorough general medical workup, 2) a neurological examination including testing of memory and other functions of thinking, and 3) a psychiatric evaluation to assess mood, ""'anxiety'', and clarity of thought.''Such an evaluation takes time - usually at least an hour. In the United States healthcare system, neurologists, psychiatrists, or geriatricians frequently become involved. Nonetheless, any physician may be able to perform a thorough evaluation.''The American Academy of Neurology has published guidelines that include imaging of the brain in the initial evaluation of patients with dementia. These studies are either a noncontrast ''CT scan'' or an ''MRI'"" scan. Other imaging procedures that look at the function of the brain (functional neuroimaging), such as SPECT, PET, and MRI, may be helpful in specific cases, but generally are not needed. However, in many healthcare systems outside of the United States, brain imaging as not a standard part of the assessment for possible Alzheimer's disease.""""Despite many attempts, identification of a blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease has remained elusive. Such testing is neither widely available nor recommended."" A person has sufficient cognitive decline to meet criteria for dementia; The clinical course is consistent with that of Alzheimer's disease; No other brain diseases or other processes are better explanations for the dementia. Neurological disorders: Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease and strokes, brain tumors, blood clots, and multiple sclerosis can sometimes be associated with dementia although many patients with these conditions are cognitively normal. Infectious diseases: Some brain infections such as chronic syphilis, chronic HIV, or chronic fungal meningitis can cause dementia. Side effects of medications: Many medicines can cause cognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients. Perhaps the most frequent offenders are drugs used to control bladder urgency and incontinence. ""Psychiatric medications"" such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications and ""neurological medications"" such as anti-seizure medications can also be associated with cognitive impairment. If a physician evaluates a person with cognitive impairment who is on one of these medications, the medication is often gently tapered and/or discontinued to determine whether it might be the cause of the cognitive impairment. If it is clear that the cognitive impairment preceded the use of these medications, such tapering may not be necessary. On the other hand, ""psychiatric,"" ""neurological,"" and ""incontinence"" medications are often appropriately prescribed to patients with Alzheimer's disease. Such patients need to be followed carefully to determine whether these medications cause any worsening of cognition. Psychiatric disorders: In older persons, some forms of depression can cause problems with memory and concentration that initially may be indistinguishable from the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes, these conditions, referred to as pseudodementia, can be reversed. Studies have shown that persons with depression and coexistent cognitive (thinking, memory) impairment are highly likely to have an underlying dementia when followed for several years. Substance Abuse: Abuse of legal and/or illegal drugs and alcohol abuse is often associated with cognitive impairment. Metabolic Disorders: Thyroid dysfunction, some steroid disorders, and nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency or thiamine deficiency are sometimes associated with cognitive impairment. Trauma: Significant head injuries with brain contusions may cause dementia. Blood clots around the outside of the brain (subdural hematomas) may also be associated with dementia. Toxic Factors: Long term consequences of acute carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to an encephalopathy with dementia. In some rare cases, heavy metal poisoning can be associated with dementia. Tumors: Many primary and metastatic brain tumors can cause dementia. However, many patients with brain tumors have no or little cognitive impairment associated with the tumor."
"What treatment and management options are available for Alzheimer's disease 
patients?","""The management of Alzheimer's disease consists of medication based and non-medication based treatments. Two different classes of pharmaceuticals are approved by the FDA for treating Alzheimer's disease: cholinesterase inhibitors and partial glutamate antagonists. Neither class of drugs has been proven to slow the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, many ""'clinical trials'' suggest that these medications are superior to placebos (''sugar'' pills) in relieving some symptoms.'  "
Alzheimer's disease medications,"""In patients with Alzheimer's disease there is a relative lack of a brain chemical neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. (Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers produced by nerves that the nerves use to communicate with each other in order to carry out their functions.) Substantial research has demonstrated that acetylcholine is important in the ability to form new memories. The cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) block the breakdown of acetylcholine. As a result, more acetylcholine is available in the brain, and it may become easier to form new memories.""'Four ChEIs have been approved by the FDA, but only ''donepezil'' hydrochloride (''Aricept''), ''rivastigmine'' (''Exelon''), and ''galantamine'' (''Razadyne'' - previously called Reminyl) are used by most physicians because the fourth drug, ''tacrine'"" (Cognex) has more undesirable side effects than the other three. Most experts in Alzheimer's disease do not believe there is an important difference in the effectiveness of these three drugs. Several studies suggest that the progression of symptoms of patients on these drugs seems to plateau for six to 12 months, but inevitably progression then begins again.""""Of the three widely used ChEIs, rivastigmine and galantamine are only approved by the FDA for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, whereas donepezil is approved for mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether rivastigmine and galantamine are also effective in severe Alzheimer's disease, although there does not appear to be any good reason why they shouldn't.""'The principal side effects of ChEIs involve the gastrointestinal system and include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', cramping, and ''diarrhea''. Usually these side effects can be controlled with change in size or timing of the dose or administering the medications with a small amount of food. A majority of patients will tolerate therapeutic doses of ChEIs.''Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. One theory suggests that too much glutamate may be bad for the brain and cause deterioration of nerve cells. ''Memantine'' (''Namenda'') works by partially decreasing the effect of glutamate to activate nerve cells. Studies have demonstrated that some patients on memantine can care for themselves better than patients on ''sugar'' pills (placebos). Memantine is approved for treatment of moderate and severe dementia, and studies did not show it was helpful in mild dementia. It is also possible to treat patients with both AchEs and memantine without loss of effectiveness of either medication or an increase in side effects.'""In 2014, Namzaric was FDA approved for use as a fixed-dose combination of memantine hydrochloride extended-release (an NMDA receptor antagonist) and donepezil hydrochloride (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) for treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's.""'Memantine ER (extended release) is currently marketed under the name ''Namenda XR'"", and it is used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's.""

"Non-drug based treatments 
for Alzheimer's disease","""Non-medication based treatments include maximizing patients' opportunities for social interaction and participating in activities such as ""'walking'', singing, dancing that they can still enjoy.

Treatment of psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease,"""Symptoms of Alzheimer's disease""' include agitation, ''depression'', ''hallucinations'', ''anxiety'', and ''sleep disorders'"". Standard psychiatric drugs are widely used to treat these symptoms although none of these drugs have been specifically approved by the FDA for treating these symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. If these behaviors are infrequent or mild, they often do not require treatment with medication. Non-pharmacologic measures can be very useful.""""Nevertheless, frequently these symptoms are so severe that it becomes impossible for caregivers to take care of the patient, and treatment with medication to control these symptoms becomes necessary. Agitation is common, particularly in middle and later stages of Alzheimer's disease. Many different classes of agents have been tried to treat agitation including:""'Studies are conflicting about the usefulness of these different drug classes. It was thought that newer, atypical antipsychotic agents such as ''clozapine'' (''Clozaril''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa'', ''Zydis''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), and ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon'"") might have advantages over the older antipsychotic agents because of their fewer and less severe side effects and the patients' ability to tolerate them. However, more recent studies have not demonstrated superiority of the newer antipsychotics. Some research shows that these newer antipsychotics may be associated with increased risk of ""'stroke'' or sudden death than the older antipsychotics, but many physicians believe this question is still not resolved.''Apathy and ''difficulty concentrating'"" occur in most Alzheimer's disease patients and should not be treated with ""'antidepressant'"" medications. However, many Alzheimer's disease patients have other symptoms of ""'depression'' including sustained feelings of unhappiness and/or inability to enjoy their usual activities. Such patients may benefit from a trial of antidepressant medication. Most physicians will try selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), or ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac'""), as first-line agents for treating depression in Alzheimer's disease.""'Anxiety'"" is another symptom in Alzheimer's disease that occasionally requires treatment.

Non-''benzodiazepine'' anxiolytics, such as ''buspirone'' (Buspar) or SSRIs, are probably preferable.''Difficulty sleeping (''insomnia'"") occurs in many patients with Alzheimer's disease at some point in the course of their disease. Many Alzheimer's disease specialists prefer the use of sedating atypical antidepressants such as trazodone (Desyrel). However, other specialists may recommend other classes of medications.

What is the prognosis for a person with Alzheimer's disease?,"""Alzheimer's disease is invariably progressive. Different studies have stated that Alzheimer's disease progresses over two to 25 years with most patients in the eight to 15 year range. Nonetheless, defining when Alzheimer's disease starts, particularly in retrospect, can be very difficult. Patients usually don't die directly from Alzheimer's disease. They die because they have ""'difficulty swallowing'' or walking and these changes make overwhelming infections, such as ''pneumonia'', much more likely.'""Most persons with Alzheimer's disease can remain at home as long as some assistance is provided by others as the disease progresses. Moreover, throughout much of the course of the illness, individuals maintain the capacity for giving and receiving love, sharing warm interpersonal relationships, and participating in a variety of meaningful activities with family and friends.""""A person with Alzheimer's disease may no longer be able to do math but still may be able to read a magazine with pleasure. Playing the piano might become too stressful in the face of increasing mistakes, but singing along with others may still be satisfying. The chessboard may have to be put away, but playing tennis may still be enjoyable. Thus, despite the many exasperating moments in the lives of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families, many opportunities remain for positive interactions. Challenge, frustration, closeness, anger, warmth, sadness, and satisfaction may all be experienced by those who work to help the person with Alzheimer's disease.""""The reaction of a patient with Alzheimer's disease to the illness and his or her capacity to cope with it also vary, and may depend on such factors as lifelong personality patterns and the nature and severity of ""'stress'' in the immediate environment. Depression, severe uneasiness, ''paranoia'', or ''delusions'"" may accompany or result from the disease, but these conditions can often be improved by appropriate treatments. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, treatments are available to alleviate many of the symptoms that cause suffering."" "

Online support groups make it possible for caregivers to receive support without having to leave home. The Alzheimer's Association and other organizations sponsor support groups. Study your day to see if you can develop a routine that makes things go more smoothly. If there are times of day when the person with Alzheimer's is less confused or more cooperative, plan your routine to make the most of those moments. Keep in mind that the way the person functions may change from day to day, so try to be flexible and adapt your routine as needed. Consider using adult day care or respite services to ease the day-to-day demands of caregiving. These services allow you to have a break while knowing that the person with Alzheimer's is being well cared for. Begin to plan for the future. This may include getting financial and legal documents in order, investigating long-term care options, and determining what services are covered by health insurance and Medicare."
Communicating with a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Trying to communicate with a person who has Alzheimer's disease can be a challenge. Both understanding and being understood may be difficult.""  Choose simple words and short sentences and use a gentle, calm tone of voice. Avoid talking to the person with Alzheimer's like a baby or talking about the person as if he or she weren't there. Minimize distractions and noise—such as the television or radio—to help the person focus on what you are saying. Make eye contact and call the person by name, making sure you have his or her attention before speaking. Allow enough time for a response. Be careful not to interrupt. If the person with Alzheimer's is struggling to find a word or communicate a thought, gently try to provide the word he or she is looking for. Try to frame questions and instructions in a positive way. Be open to the person's concerns, even if he or she is hard to understand."
Bathing a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""While some people with Alzheimer's disease don't mind bathing, for others it is a frightening, confusing experience. Advance planning can help make bath time better for both of you."" Plan the bath or shower for the time of day when the person is most calm and agreeable. Be consistent. Try to develop a routine. Respect the fact that bathing is scary and uncomfortable for some people with Alzheimer's. Be gentle and respectful. Be patient and calm. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step, and allow him or her to do as much as possible. Prepare in advance. Make sure you have everything you need ready and in the bathroom before beginning. Draw the bath ahead of time. Be sensitive to the temperature. Warm up the room beforehand if necessary and keep extra towels and a robe nearby. Test the water temperature before beginning the bath or shower. Minimize safety risks by using a handheld showerhead, shower bench, grab bars, and nonskid bath mats. Never leave the person alone in the bath or shower. Try a sponge bath. Bathing may not be necessary every day. A sponge bath can be effective between showers or baths."
Dressing a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""For someone who has Alzheimer's, getting dressed presents a series of challenges: choosing what to wear, getting some clothes off and other clothes on, and struggling with buttons and zippers. Minimizing the challenges may make a difference."" Try to have the person get dressed at the same time each day so he or she will come to expect it as part of the daily routine. Encourage the person to dress himself or herself to whatever degree possible. Plan to allow extra time so there is no pressure or rush. Allow the person to choose from a limited selection of outfits. If he or she has a favorite outfit, consider buying several identical sets. Store some clothes in another room to reduce the number of choices. Keep only one or two outfits in the closet or dresser. Arrange the clothes in the order they are to be put on to help the person move through the process. Hand the person one item at a time or give clear, step-by-step instructions if the person needs prompting. Choose clothing that is comfortable, easy to get on and off, and easy to care for. Elastic waists and Velcro® enclosures minimize struggles with buttons and zippers."
Eating: Getting a Person with Alzheimer's Disease to Eat,"""Eating can be a challenge. Some people with Alzheimer's disease want to eat all the time, while others have to be encouraged to maintain a good ""'diet''.'   View mealtimes as opportunities for social interaction and success for the person with Alzheimer's. Try to be patient and avoid rushing, and be sensitive to confusion and anxiety. Aim for a quiet, calm, reassuring mealtime atmosphere by limiting noise and other distractions. Maintain familiar mealtime routines, but adapt to the person's changing needs. Give the person food choices, but limit the number of choices. Try to offer appealing foods that have familiar flavors, varied textures, and different colors. Serve small portions or several small meals throughout the day. Make healthy snacks, finger foods, and shakes available. In the earlier stages of dementia, be aware of the possibility of overeating. Choose dishes and eating tools that promote independence. If the person has trouble using utensils, use a bowl instead of a plate, or offer utensils with large or built-up handles. Use straws or cups with lids to make drinking easier. Encourage the person to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day to avoid dehydration. As the disease progresses, be aware of the increased risk of choking because of chewing and swallowing problems. Maintain routine dental checkups and daily oral health care to keep the mouth and teeth healthy."
Activities for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""What to do all day? Finding activities that the person with Alzheimer's disease can do and is interested in can be a challenge. Building on current skills generally works better than trying to teach something new.""  Don't expect too much. Simple activities often are best, especially when they use current abilities. Help the person get started on an activity. Break the activity down into small steps and praise the person for each step he or she completes. Watch for signs of agitation or frustration with an activity. Gently help or distract the person to something else. Incorporate activities the person seems to enjoy into your daily routine and try to do them at a similar time each day. Try to include the person with Alzheimer's in the entire activity process. For instance, at mealtimes, encourage the person to help prepare the food, set the table, pull out the chairs, or put away the dishes. This can help maintain functional skills, enhance feelings of personal control, and make good use of time. Take advantage of adult day services, which provide various activities for the person with Alzheimer's, as well as an opportunity for caregivers to gain temporary relief from tasks associated with caregiving. Transportation and meals often are provided."
Exercise for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'Incorporating ''exercise'"" into the daily routine has benefits for both the person with Alzheimer's disease and the caregiver. Not only can it improve health, but it also can provide a meaningful activity for both of you to share."" Think about what kind of physical activities you both enjoy, perhaps walking, swimming, tennis, dancing, or gardening. Determine the time of day and place where this type of activity would work best. Be realistic in your expectations. Build slowly, perhaps just starting with a short walk around the yard, for example, before progressing to a walk around the block. Be aware of any discomfort or signs of overexertion. Talk to the person's doctor if this happens. Allow as much independence as possible, even if it means a less-than-perfect garden or a scoreless tennis match. See what kinds of exercise programs are available in your area. Senior centers may have group programs for people who enjoy exercising with others. Local malls often have walking clubs and provide a place to exercise when the weather is bad. Encourage physical activities. Spend time outside when the weather permits. Exercise often helps everyone sleep better."
Incontinence in a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""As the disease progresses, many people with Alzheimer's begin to experience ""'incontinence'"", or the inability to control their bladder and/or bowels. Incontinence can be upsetting to the person and difficult for the caregiver. Sometimes incontinence is due to physical illness, so be sure to discuss it with the person's doctor."" Have a routine for taking the person to the bathroom and stick to it as closely as possible. For example, take the person to the bathroom every 3 hours or so during the day. Don't wait for the person to ask. Watch for signs that the person may have to go to the bathroom, such as restlessness or pulling at clothes. Respond quickly. Be understanding when accidents occur. Stay calm and reassure the person if he or she is upset. Try to keep track of when accidents happen to help plan ways to avoid them. To help prevent nighttime accidents, limit certain types of fluids—such as those with caffeine—in the evening. If you are going to be out with the person, plan ahead. Know where restrooms are located, and have the person wear simple, easy-to-remove clothing. Take an extra set of clothing along in case of an accident."
Sleep Problems for Caregivers and a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'For the exhausted caregiver, ''sleep'' can\'t come too soon. For many people with Alzheimer\'s disease, however, the approach of nighttime may be a difficult time. Many people with Alzheimer\'s become restless, agitated, and irritable around dinnertime, often referred to as ""sundowning"" syndrome. Getting the person to go to bed and stay there may require some advance planning.'   Encourage exercise during the day and limit daytime napping, but make sure that the person gets adequate rest during the day because fatigue can increase the likelihood of late afternoon restlessness. Try to schedule physically demanding activities earlier in the day. For example, bathing could be done in the morning, or the largest family meal could be served at midday. Set a quiet, peaceful tone in the evening to encourage sleep. Keep the lights dim, eliminate loud noises, even play soothing music if the person seems to enjoy it. Try to keep bedtime at a similar time each evening. Developing a bedtime routine may help. Limit caffeine. Use night-lights in the bedroom, hall, and bathroom if the darkness is frightening or disorienting. "
Hallucinations and Delusions in a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease may experience ""'hallucinations'' and/or ''delusions''. Hallucinations are when the person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something that is not there. Delusions are false beliefs that the person thinks are real.' Sometimes hallucinations and delusions are signs of physical illness. Keep track of what the person is experiencing and discuss it with the doctor. Avoid arguing with the person about what he or she sees or hears. Try to respond to the feelings he or she is expressing. Comfort the person if he or she is afraid. Try to distract the person to another topic or activity. Sometimes moving to another room or going outside for a walk may help. Turn off the television set when violent or disturbing programs are on. The person with Alzheimer's may not be able to distinguish television programming from reality. Make sure the person is safe and does not have access to anything he or she could use to harm anyone. Discuss with the doctor any illness the person has had or medicines he or she is taking. Sometimes an illness or medicine may cause hallucinations or delusions."
Wandering: A Problem for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Keeping the person safe is one of the most important aspects of caregiving. Some people with Alzheimer's disease have a tendency to wander away from their home or their caregiver. Knowing how to limit wandering can protect a person from getting lost.""  Make sure that the person carries some kind of identification or wears a medical bracelet. Consider enrolling the person in the Alzheimer's Association Safe Return program if the program is available in your area. If the person gets lost and is unable to communicate adequately, identification will alert others to the person's medical condition. Notify neighbors and local authorities in advance that the person has a tendency to wander. Keep a recent photograph or videotape of the person with Alzheimer's to assist police if the person becomes lost. Keep doors locked. Consider a keyed deadbolt or an additional lock up high or down low on the door. If the person can open a lock because it is familiar, a new latch or lock may help. Install an ""announcing system"" that chimes when the door opens. "
Home Safety for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'Caregivers of people with Alzheimer\'s disease often have to look at their homes through new eyes to identify and correct safety risks. Creating a safe environment can prevent many stressful and dangerous situations. The ADEAR Center offers the booklet, Home Safety for People with Alzheimer\'s Disease, which lists many helpful tips. See ""For More Information"" to contact the ADEAR Center.' Install secure locks on all outside windows and doors, especially if the person is prone to wandering. Remove the locks on bathroom doors to prevent the person from accidentally locking himself or herself in. Use childproof latches on kitchen cabinets and anyplace where cleaning supplies or other chemicals are kept. Label medications and keep them locked up. Also make sure knives, lighters and matches, and guns are secured and out of reach. Keep the house free from clutter. Remove scatter rugs and anything else that might contribute to a fall. Make sure lighting is good both inside and outside the home. Be alert to and address kitchen-safety issues, such as the person forgetting to turn off the stove after cooking. Consider installing an automatic shut-off switch on the stove to preventburns or fire. Be sure to secure or put away anything that could cause danger, both inside and outside the home."
Driving: Decisions for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Making the decision that a person with Alzheimer's is no longer safe to drive is difficult, and it needs to be communicated carefully and sensitively. Even though the person may be upset by the loss of independence, safety must be the priority."" Look for clues that safe driving is no longer possible, including getting lost in familiar places, driving too fast or too slow, disregarding traffic signs, or getting angry or confused. Be sensitive to the person's feelings about losing the ability to drive, but be firm in your request that he or she no longer do so. Be consistent—don't allow the person to drive on ""good days"" but forbid it on ""bad days."" Ask the doctor to help. The person may view the doctor as an authority and be willing to stop driving. The doctor also can contact the Department of Motor Vehicles and request that the person be reevaluated. If necessary, take the car keys. If just having keys is important to the person, substitute a different set of keys. If all else fails, disable the car or move it to a location where the person cannot see it or gain access to it. Ask family or friends to drive the person or find out about services that help people with disabilities get around their community. "
Visiting the Doctor with a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""It is important that the person with Alzheimer's disease receive regular medical care. Advance planning can help the trip to the doctor's office go more smoothly."" Try to schedule the appointment for the person's best time of day. Also, ask the office staff what time of day the office is least crowded. Let the office staff know in advance that this person may be confused because of Alzheimer's disease. Ask them for help to make the visit go smoothly. Don't tell the person about the appointment until the day of the visit or even shortly before it is time to go. Be positive and matter-of-fact. Bring along something for the person to eat and drink and any materials or activities that he or she enjoys. Have a friend or another family member go with you on the trip, so that one of you can be with the person while the other speaks with the doctor. Take a brief summary listing the person's medical history, primary care doctor, and current medications. "
Coping with Holidays for Caregivers and a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Holidays are bittersweet for many Alzheimer's disease caregivers. The happy memories of the past contrast with the difficulties of the present, and extra demands on time and energy can seem overwhelming. Finding a balance between rest and activity can help."" Keep or adapt family traditions that are important to you. Include the person with Alzheimer's as much as possible. Recognize that things will be different, and be realistic about what you can do. Encourage friends and family to visit. Limit the number of visitors at one time, and try to schedule visits during the time of day when the person is at his or her best. Avoid crowds, changes in routine, and strange places that may cause confusion or agitation. Do your best to enjoy yourself. Try to find time for the holiday things you like to do. Ask a friend or family member to spend time with the person while you are out. At larger gatherings such as weddings or family reunions, try to have a space available where the person can rest, be alone, or spend some time with a smaller number of people, if needed. "
Visiting a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Visitors are important to people with Alzheimer's. They may not always remember who the visitors are, but the human connection has value. Here are some ideas to share with someone who is planning to visit a person with the disease."" Plan the visit for the time of day when the person with Alzheimer's is at his or her best. Consider bringing along an activity, such as something familiar to read or photo albums to look at, but be prepared to skip it if necessary. Be calm and quiet. Avoid using a loud tone of voice or talking to the person as if he or she were a child. Respect the person's personal space and don't get too close. Try to establish eye contact and call the person by name to get his or her attention. Remind the person who you are if he or she doesn't seem to recognize you. Don't argue if the person is confused. Respond to the feelings you hear being communicated, and distract the person to a different topic if necessary. Remember not to take it personally if the person doesn't recognize you, is unkind, or responds angrily. He or she is reacting out of confusion. "
Choosing a Nursing Home for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'For many caregivers, there comes a point when they are no longer able to take care of their loved one at home. Choosing a residential care facility—a group home, assisted living facility, or ''nursing'' home—is a big decision, and it can be hard to know where to start.'  It's helpful to gather information about services and options before the need actually arises. This gives you time to explore fully all the possibilities before making a decision. Determine what facilities are in your area. Doctors, friends and relatives, hospital social workers, and religious organizations may be able to help you identify specific facilities. Make a list of questions you would like to ask the staff. Think about what is important to you, such as activity programs, transportation, or special units for people with Alzheimer's disease. Contact the places that interest you and make an appointment to visit. Talk to the administration, nursing staff, and residents. Observe the way the facility runs and how residents are treated. You may want to drop by again unannounced to see if your impressions are the same. Find out what kinds of programs and services are offered for people with Alzheimer's and their families. Ask about staff training in dementia care, and check to see what the policy is about family participation in planning patient care. Check on room availability, cost and method of payment, and participation in Medicare or Medicaid. You may want to place your name on a waiting list even if you are not ready to make an immediate decision about long-term care. Once you have made a decision, be sure you understand the terms of the contract and financial agreement. You may want to have a lawyer review the documents with you before signing. Moving is a big change for both the person with Alzheimer's disease and the caregiver. A social worker may be able to help you plan for and adjust to the move. It is important to have support during this difficult transition."

What is Alzheimer's disease?,"""Alzheimer's""' disease (also termed Alzheimer disease) is a progressive mental deterioration that can occur in middle-aged individuals, but usually occurs in individuals that are about 60 to 65 years old or older. Early or younger onset Alzheimer’s can occur in individuals aged about 40 – 65. The disease is due to generalized deterioration of brain function related to plaques that develop in the brain tissue. The cause of '""Alzheimer's"""" is unknown. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of premature ""'senility'"". In 214, as many as 5 million Americans age 65 and older had Alzheimer's and approximately 200,000 individuals have younger or early onset Alzheimer's disease. Statisticians predict by 2060 about 14 million people will have Alzheimer’s disease."" "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and stages of Alzheimer's disease?","""Although the course of Alzheimer's disease varies from person to person, several stages are recognized. How many stages are recognized depends on what expert you consult (described stages may range from 3 to 7). Almost all experts agree that there at least three major stages:""""Those experts that list up to seven stages do so by breaking the three stages into subsets (for example, the severe stage is broken into severe decline and very severe decline). These stages are defined by certain signs and symptoms. The object of this article is to list those signs and symptoms that usually appear in these stages. Unfortunately, some people with Alzheimer's disease may have some symptoms that may cross over stages.""'People with Alzheimer\'s disease, family members, and others are often told that the affected person has mild, moderate or severe disease. However, others are told they are in one of seven Alzheimer\'s stages (stages previously used by some physicians and other health-care professionals). This seven stage designation is termed the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). A few other experts even break down the seven stages into subsets (for example, stage into 6a -6f). Moreover, the stages have various names depending on who is describing them. Consequently, people can be confused if they hear about various ""stages"" of Alzheimer\'s disease. In an effort to clarify the situation, all seven Global Deterioration Scale will be presented along with their names (subsets will not be presented) and then each Global Deterioration Scale stage will then be rated as mild, moderate or severe.''The Alzheimer Association provides a list of 10 ""early"" signs and symptoms of Alzheimer\'s disease; they are:''Although some of the signs and symptoms may appear occasionally with age-related changes and not be due to Alzheimer’s disease, if the above signs and symptoms cause anyone to worry about a potential diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, the individual should be seen and evaluated by a health-care professional.' mild (early stage), moderate (middle stage), and severe (late stage). Reduced ability in planning or problem-solving Difficulty completing familiar tasks done at home, work or at leisure Confusion due to loss of understanding of dates and time Difficulty understanding visual images and spatial relationships Memory loss that disrupts daily life Problems with speaking or writing Misplacing things in unusual places and not being able to retrace steps to find items Decreasing judgment and/or poor judgment when dealing with finances and/or personal hygiene Avoiding work and/or social activities Changes in personality, behavior, and mood."
Stage 1: No impairment,"'Global Deterioration Scale stage 1 of Alzheimer\'s disease is termed ""no impairment,"" which means that the person has no noticeable symptoms, and is fully independent with no memory or reasoning problems (mild Alzheimer\'s disease).'   No noticeable memory problems No noticeable reasoning problems"
Stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline,"'Stage 2 of early Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease is termed ""very mild cognitive decline."" The signs and symptoms of the second stage of Alzheimer\'s disease are:'""Usually, these patients can function socially and at work (mild Alzheimer's disease)."" Mild memory loss Forgetting names of known individuals Minor problems with concentration"
Stage 3: Mild cognitive decline,"'Deterioration Scale stage 3 of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""mild cognitive decline,"" is characterized by worsening of the first and second Global Deterioration Scale stage symptoms and also can include:'""Family members and co-workers may begin to notice these changes, but many people remain undiagnosed at this stage (mild Alzheimer's disease). "" Forgetting new information Declining work performance Difficulty with making future plans  Becoming less able to organize Repeating questions"
Stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline,"'Stage 4 of the Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease, termed ""moderate decline,"" like the third stage, involves worsening of the conditions seen in previous stages. For example, ''memory loss'"" and memory deficits become more prominent and difficulties with complex actions become more obvious. Other examples of symptoms of the fourth stage of Alzheimer's disease include:""'Since the above problems become prominent and ''mood swings'"" are usually out of character for the individual, this is the stage when most of the people have theirs doctors diagnose them with Alzheimer's disease (moderate Alzheimer's disease).""  Difficulties with complex actions (for example, balancing the checkbook) Cannot plan ahead easily Mood changes and/or mood swings May become depressed May become withdrawn from social contacts May shun challenging situations (for example, family money matters)"
Stage 5: Moderately severe decline,"'Stage 5 of Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease, termed ""moderately severe decline,"" is determined when the individual is no longer able to do routine tasks without some assistance. Typical problems of the previous stages become worse; added to these problems are the patient\'s inability to remember to do common daily tasks (moderate Alzheimer\'s disease), for example, the person:' May have difficulty remembering common information (for example, home address or phone number) Can no longer do routine tasks such as making a meal without some assistance May become disoriented to time or place Has a noticeable decline in personal hygiene habits, for example, brushing the teeth and/or bathroom hygiene"
Stage 6: Severe decline,"'In stage 6 of the Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""severe decline,"" all of the problems seen in the other 5 stages considerably worsen, especially memory (severe Alzheimer\'s disease), for example:'   Daily activities such as getting dressed are compromised. Affected individuals forget the names of people they should know (for example the names of their spouses and/or children). The personality changes of the person become more pronounced and may include paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions. Affected individuals will require personal help with daily tasks including personal hygiene (for example, they may not be able to take a shower unless assisted). Many people with Alzheimer's disease will need monitoring as some will walk out of their residence and become lost. "
Stage 7: Very severe decline,"'In Global Deterioration Scale stage 7 of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""very severe decline,"" affected individuals have declined so much that they require continual assistance to carry out basic activities such as getting out of the chair or feeding themselves (severe Alzheimer\'s disease). Those people affected:' Can decline so far that they may not be able to talk or respond to their environment Will not be able to control muscle movement That talk may have only meaningless verbiage May not be able to even sit without support, while others may become rigid Eventually will not be able to swallow foods and/or liquids"
Conclusion," Individuals usually are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease during the moderate stages of the disease (stage 2 of 3 in the simplified staging system or Global Deterioration Scale stage 4 to 7). The disease is progressive and progresses at different rates with varying symptoms in each individual diagnosed with this disease. Treatment methods may vary with each individual according to their stage and severity of symptoms. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments may help reduce or slow the development of the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Staging may help family, caregivers, and friends to better understand what Alzheimer's disease is doing to the individual."
Introduction,"'As you and your family evaluate your long-term care needs for dealing with '""Alzheimer's""' disease, it is important to consider financing options including health coverage, Medicare, and Medicaid. Long-term financial planning is important for everyone -- but is essential if you are coping with the expense of a long-term illness, such as '""Alzheimer's"""" disease. Many people pay careful attention to their health after they are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. They research their treatment plan, take their medications on schedule, and consult with their physician regularly. However, it may take some time for patients and caregivers to realize that a progressive illness like Alzheimer's can have a tremendous effect on their financial well-being.""""This article offers some basic information on how to handle your finances while living with Alzheimer's disease."" "
Developing a Plan,"""Alzheimer's disease gets worse over time, and dealing with a progressive illness is difficult. There is no way to know how you will feel or what you will be able to do days, months, or years from now. But for your own security and that of your family, you need to plan ahead, knowing that Alzheimer's disease will lead to increasing disability. There are professional financial managers and medical lawyers who deal with financial planning for people with long-term or progressive illnesses. Ask your doctor for a referral, or speak with a national association or support group to find a reputable professional in this area."" "

or your financial planner. If you are unemployed and you do not have coverage, you should look for the 
highest level of coverage that you can afford. The Alzheimer's Association may 
be able to give you a list of insurers with a high level of Alzheimer's 
coverage. If you are 65 or over, you qualify for Medicare. You can supplement this 
insurance with a ""Medigap"" 
policy available through a private insurer. Note also that many states have 
prescription assistance/reimbursement programs for low-income senior 
citizens. If you are disabled but too young to qualify for Social Security, you may 
be eligible to receive a form of Medicare for the disabled. If you cannot get insurance and your income is low, you may qualify for 
Medicaid, a government ""safety net"" program that pays for medical costs that 
exceed a person's ability to pay."
Investigate Long- and Short-term Disability Insurance,"'Check to see if your employer has private disability insurance, and contact your human resources department to investigate your eligibility, the cost of enrolling, and how much of your salary it will cover.''Medicare and Medicaid' If you are unable to continue working. If you are too young to qualify for Social Security, you should consider 
state-run disability programs, unless you are enrolled in your employer's 
disability coverage. If your total income is below a certain level, you may qualify for 
federally subsidized Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If you collect SSI, 
regardless of your age, you are a candidate for Medicaid."
What Is Medicare?,"'Medicare is a federal health insurance program providing health care benefits to all Americans age 65 and over, as well as some disabled individuals under age 65. Eligibility for Medicare is linked to Social Security and railroad retirement benefits.''Medicare has co-payments and deductibles. A deductible is an initial amount you are responsible for paying before Medicare coverage begins. A co-payment is a percentage of the amount of covered expense you are required to pay.' "
What Are Medicare's Coverage Options?,"'Medicare has two parts:''Part A Medicare coverage includes:''Part B Medicare coverage includes:''Part B Medicare benefits require that you pay a monthly premium. You must also be entitled to Part A benefits to receive Part B benefits.' Part A (hospital insurance) Part B (medical insurance) All normal hospital services. Skilled nursing facility care. Home health services, including a visiting nurse or a physical, 
occupational, or speech 
therapist. Medical supplies. Hospice services. Eighty percent of reasonable charges from doctors and other health care 
professionals (after the annual deductible is met). Medically necessary ambulance services. Physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Home health care services (physician certification is necessary). Medical supplies and equipment. Transfusion of blood and blood components provided on an outpatient 
basis. Outpatient surgery."
Medicare Coverage of Skilled Nursing Care Facilities,"'In order to receive care in a nursing home under Medicare:' You must have had a three-day hospital stay prior to admission into the 
skilled nursing facility. You must be admitted into the skilled nursing facility within 30 days of 
discharge from the hospital. You must enter the skilled nursing facility for treatment of the same 
condition for which you were hospitalized. You must require daily skilled care. The condition must be one that can be improved by admission to the 
facility. The facility must be Medicare-certified. Your physician must write a care plan. The care plan must be carried out by 
the skilled nursing facility. (Once the patient meets the level of functioning 
laid out in the care plan, Medicare will no longer pay for services.)"
Medicare Coverage of Home Care,"'In order to receive home care under Medicare:' The patient must be homebound. The physician must certify a plan of care. Care must be needed on a non-continuous basis. Care cannot exceed 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day. Physical or speech 
therapy must be provided on a ""necessary and reasonable"" basis. There are no 
restrictions on the number of days or hours per week of these therapies. If a person qualifies for home health care, he or she is entitled to a home 
health aide to provide some personal care."
What Is Medicaid?,"'Medicaid is a joint federal-state health insurance program providing medical assistance primarily to low-income Americans. It also is available to people under 65 if they are blind or disabled.''The purpose of Medicaid is to provide preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative health services and supplies that are essential to attain an optimum level of well-being.' "
How Do People Receive Medicaid Benefits?,"'There are two ways to receive Medicaid:' Through Supplemental Security Income (SSI) -- People who receive a cash 
grant under SSI and Aid to Dependent Children are automatically eligible for 
Medicaid benefits. Medicaid spend down -- This is similar to a deductible or a co-payment 
that you must pay every month. Once you meet your ""spend down"" amount, you are 
eligible for Medicaid for the remainder of the month."
Who Is Eligible for Medicaid?,"'Medicaid eligibility requirements depend on financial need, low income, and low assets. In determining Medicaid eligibility, officials do not review rent, car payments, or food costs. They only review medical expenses. Medical expenses include:' Care from hospitals, doctors, clinics, nurses, dentists, podiatrists and 
chiropractors. Medications. Medical supplies and equipment. Health insurance premiums. Transportation to get medical care."
Medicaid Coverage,"""Medicaid coverage varies from state to state. For specific coverage guidelines, contact your state's Department of Human Services. Generally, Medicaid benefits include:""'Transportation''Ambulatory Centers''Hospital Services''Home Health Care''Skilled Nursing Facilities''For More Information:''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' Health Care Financing Administration'' 6325 Security Blvd.''Baltimore, MD 21207''(410) 786-3000''WebMD Medical Reference' Ambulance services when other means of transportation are detrimental to 
the patient's health. Transportation to and from the hospital at time of admission or discharge 
when required by the patient's condition. Transportation to and from a hospital, outpatient clinic, doctor's office,

agencies that are not part of a hospital. They provide preventive, diagnostic, 
therapeutic, and rehabilitative services under the direction of a doctor. 
Ambulatory services covered by Medicaid include dental, pharmaceutical, 
diagnostic, and vision care. Inpatient hospital care. Private hospital rooms only when the illness requires the patient to be 
isolated for his or her own health or the health of others. Outpatient preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. Professional and technical laboratory and radiological services.

Tips for Caregivers of a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'Caring for a person with '""Alzheimer's disease""' at home is a difficult task and can become overwhelming at times. Each day brings new challenges as the ''caregiver'' copes with changing levels of ability and new patterns of behavior. Research has shown that caregivers themselves often are at increased risk for ''depression'' and illness, especially if they do not receive adequate support from family, friends, and the community. One of the biggest struggles caregivers face is dealing with the difficult behaviors of the person they are caring for. Dressing, bathing, eating—basic activities of daily living—often become difficult to manage for both the person with '""Alzheimer's""' and the caregiver. Having a plan for getting through the day can help caregivers cope. Many caregivers have found it helpful to use strategies for dealing with difficult behaviors and stressful situations. Through trial and error you will find that some of the following tips work, while others do not. Each person with '""Alzheimer's""' is unique and will respond differently, and each person changes over the course of the disease. Do the best you can, and remind yourself to take breaks. ' "
Dealing with the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,"'Finding out that a loved one has '""Alzheimer's disease""' can be stressful, frightening, and overwhelming. As you begin to take stock of the situation, here are some tips that may help:'  Ask the doctor any questions you have about Alzheimer's disease. Find out what treatments might work best to alleviate symptoms or address behavior problems. Contact organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral (ADEAR) Center for more information about the disease, treatment options, andcaregiving resources. Some community groups may offer classes to teach caregiving, problem-solving, and management skills. See ""For More Information"" below to contact the ADEAR Center and a variety of other helpful organizations. Find a support group where you can share your feelings and concerns. Members of support groups often have helpful ideas or know of useful resources based on their own experiences. Online support groups make it possible for caregivers to receive support without having to leave home. The Alzheimer's Association and other organizations sponsor support groups. Study your day to see if you can develop a routine that makes things go more smoothly. If there are times of day when the person with Alzheimer's is less confused or more cooperative, plan your routine to make the most of those moments. Keep in mind that the way the person functions may change from day to day, so try to be flexible and adapt your routine as needed. Consider using adult day care or respite services to ease the day-to-day demands of caregiving. These services allow you to have a break while knowing that the person with Alzheimer's is being well cared for. Begin to plan for the future. This may include getting financial and legal documents in order, investigating long-term care options, and determining what services are covered by health insurance and Medicare."
Communicating with a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Trying to communicate with a person who has Alzheimer's disease can be a challenge. Both understanding and being understood may be difficult.""  Choose simple words and short sentences and use a gentle, calm tone of voice. Avoid talking to the person with Alzheimer's like a baby or talking about the person as if he or she weren't there. Minimize distractions and noise—such as the television or radio—to help the person focus on what you are saying. Make eye contact and call the person by name, making sure you have his or her attention before speaking. Allow enough time for a response. Be careful not to interrupt. If the person with Alzheimer's is struggling to find a word or communicate a thought, gently try to provide the word he or she is looking for. Try to frame questions and instructions in a positive way. Be open to the person's concerns, even if he or she is hard to understand."
Bathing a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""While some people with Alzheimer's disease don't mind bathing, for others it is a frightening, confusing experience. Advance planning can help make bath time better for both of you."" Plan the bath or shower for the time of day when the person is most calm and agreeable. Be consistent. Try to develop a routine. Respect the fact that bathing is scary and uncomfortable for some people with Alzheimer's. Be gentle and respectful. Be patient and calm. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step, and allow him or her to do as much as possible. Prepare in advance. Make sure you have everything you need ready and in the bathroom before beginning. Draw the bath ahead of time. Be sensitive to the temperature. Warm up the room beforehand if necessary and keep extra towels and a robe nearby. Test the water temperature before beginning the bath or shower. Minimize safety risks by using a handheld showerhead, shower bench, grab bars, and nonskid bath mats. Never leave the person alone in the bath or shower. Try a sponge bath. Bathing may not be necessary every day. A sponge bath can be effective between showers or baths."
Dressing a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""For someone who has Alzheimer's, getting dressed presents a series of challenges: choosing what to wear, getting some clothes off and other clothes on, and struggling with buttons and zippers. Minimizing the challenges may make a difference."" Try to have the person get dressed at the same time each day so he or she will come to expect it as part of the daily routine. Encourage the person to dress himself or herself to whatever degree possible. Plan to allow extra time so there is no pressure or rush. Allow the person to choose from a limited selection of outfits. If he or she has a favorite outfit, consider buying several identical sets. Store some clothes in another room to reduce the number of choices. Keep only one or two outfits in the closet or dresser. Arrange the clothes in the order they are to be put on to help the person move through the process. Hand the person one item at a time or give clear, step-by-step instructions if the person needs prompting. Choose clothing that is comfortable, easy to get on and off, and easy to care for. Elastic waists and Velcro® enclosures minimize struggles with buttons and zippers."
Eating: Getting a Person with Alzheimer's Disease to Eat,"""Eating can be a challenge. Some people with Alzheimer's disease want to eat all the time, while others have to be encouraged to maintain a good ""'diet''.'   View mealtimes as opportunities for social interaction and success for the person with Alzheimer's. Try to be patient and avoid rushing, and be sensitive to confusion and anxiety. Aim for a quiet, calm, reassuring mealtime atmosphere by limiting noise and other distractions. Maintain familiar mealtime routines, but adapt to the person's changing needs. Give the person food choices, but limit the number of choices. Try to offer appealing foods that have familiar flavors, varied textures, and different colors. Serve small portions or several small meals throughout the day. Make healthy snacks, finger foods, and shakes available. In the earlier stages of dementia, be aware of the possibility of overeating. Choose dishes and eating tools that promote independence. If the person has trouble using utensils, use a bowl instead of a plate, or offer utensils with large or built-up handles. Use straws or cups with lids to make drinking easier. Encourage the person to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day to avoid dehydration. As the disease progresses, be aware of the increased risk of choking because of chewing and swallowing problems. Maintain routine dental checkups and daily oral health care to keep the mouth and teeth healthy."
Activities for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""What to do all day? Finding activities that the person with Alzheimer's disease can do and is interested in can be a challenge. Building on current skills generally works better than trying to teach something new.""  Don't expect too much. Simple activities often are best, especially when they use current abilities. Help the person get started on an activity. Break the activity down into small steps and praise the person for each step he or she completes. Watch for signs of agitation or frustration with an activity. Gently help or distract the person to something else. Incorporate activities the person seems to enjoy into your daily routine and try to do them at a similar time each day. Try to include the person with Alzheimer's in the entire activity process. For instance, at mealtimes, encourage the person to help prepare the food, set the table, pull out the chairs, or put away the dishes. This can help maintain functional skills, enhance feelings of personal control, and make good use of time. Take advantage of adult day services, which provide various activities for the person with Alzheimer's, as well as an opportunity for caregivers to gain temporary relief from tasks associated with caregiving. Transportation and meals often are provided."
Exercise for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'Incorporating ''exercise'"" into the daily routine has benefits for both the person with Alzheimer's disease and the caregiver. Not only can it improve health, but it also can provide a meaningful activity for both of you to share."" Think about what kind of physical activities you both enjoy, perhaps walking, swimming, tennis, dancing, or gardening. Determine the time of day and place where this type of activity would work best. Be realistic in your expectations. Build slowly, perhaps just starting with a short walk around the yard, for example, before progressing to a walk around the block. Be aware of any discomfort or signs of overexertion. Talk to the person's doctor if this happens. Allow as much independence as possible, even if it means a less-than-perfect garden or a scoreless tennis match. See what kinds of exercise programs are available in your area. Senior centers may have group programs for people who enjoy exercising with others. Local malls often have walking clubs and provide a place to exercise when the weather is bad. Encourage physical activities. Spend time outside when the weather permits. Exercise often helps everyone sleep better."
Incontinence in a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""As the disease progresses, many people with Alzheimer's begin to experience ""'incontinence'"", or the inability to control their bladder and/or bowels. Incontinence can be upsetting to the person and difficult for the caregiver. Sometimes incontinence is due to physical illness, so be sure to discuss it with the person's doctor."" Have a routine for taking the person to the bathroom and stick to it as closely as possible. For example, take the person to the bathroom every 3 hours or so during the day. Don't wait for the person to ask. Watch for signs that the person may have to go to the bathroom, such as restlessness or pulling at clothes. Respond quickly. Be understanding when accidents occur. Stay calm and reassure the person if he or she is upset. Try to keep track of when accidents happen to help plan ways to avoid them. To help prevent nighttime accidents, limit certain types of fluids—such as those with caffeine—in the evening. If you are going to be out with the person, plan ahead. Know where restrooms are located, and have the person wear simple, easy-to-remove clothing. Take an extra set of clothing along in case of an accident."
Sleep Problems for Caregivers and a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'For the exhausted caregiver, ''sleep'' can\'t come too soon. For many people with Alzheimer\'s disease, however, the approach of nighttime may be a difficult time. Many people with Alzheimer\'s become restless, agitated, and irritable around dinnertime, often referred to as ""sundowning"" syndrome. Getting the person to go to bed and stay there may require some advance planning.'   Encourage exercise during the day and limit daytime napping, but make sure that the person gets adequate rest during the day because fatigue can increase the likelihood of late afternoon restlessness. Try to schedule physically demanding activities earlier in the day. For example, bathing could be done in the morning, or the largest family meal could be served at midday. Set a quiet, peaceful tone in the evening to encourage sleep. Keep the lights dim, eliminate loud noises, even play soothing music if the person seems to enjoy it. Try to keep bedtime at a similar time each evening. Developing a bedtime routine may help. Limit caffeine. Use night-lights in the bedroom, hall, and bathroom if the darkness is frightening or disorienting. "
Hallucinations and Delusions in a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""As the disease progresses, a person with Alzheimer's disease may experience ""'hallucinations'' and/or ''delusions''. Hallucinations are when the person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something that is not there. Delusions are false beliefs that the person thinks are real.' Sometimes hallucinations and delusions are signs of physical illness. Keep track of what the person is experiencing and discuss it with the doctor. Avoid arguing with the person about what he or she sees or hears. Try to respond to the feelings he or she is expressing. Comfort the person if he or she is afraid. Try to distract the person to another topic or activity. Sometimes moving to another room or going outside for a walk may help. Turn off the television set when violent or disturbing programs are on. The person with Alzheimer's may not be able to distinguish television programming from reality. Make sure the person is safe and does not have access to anything he or she could use to harm anyone. Discuss with the doctor any illness the person has had or medicines he or she is taking. Sometimes an illness or medicine may cause hallucinations or delusions."
Wandering: A Problem for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Keeping the person safe is one of the most important aspects of caregiving. Some people with Alzheimer's disease have a tendency to wander away from their home or their caregiver. Knowing how to limit wandering can protect a person from getting lost.""  Make sure that the person carries some kind of identification or wears a medical bracelet. Consider enrolling the person in the Alzheimer's Association Safe Return program if the program is available in your area. If the person gets lost and is unable to communicate adequately, identification will alert others to the person's medical condition. Notify neighbors and local authorities in advance that the person has a tendency to wander. Keep a recent photograph or videotape of the person with Alzheimer's to assist police if the person becomes lost. Keep doors locked. Consider a keyed deadbolt or an additional lock up high or down low on the door. If the person can open a lock because it is familiar, a new latch or lock may help. Install an ""announcing system"" that chimes when the door opens. "
Home Safety for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'Caregivers of people with Alzheimer\'s disease often have to look at their homes through new eyes to identify and correct safety risks. Creating a safe environment can prevent many stressful and dangerous situations. The ADEAR Center offers the booklet, Home Safety for People with Alzheimer\'s Disease, which lists many helpful tips. See ""For More Information"" to contact the ADEAR Center.' Install secure locks on all outside windows and doors, especially if the person is prone to wandering. Remove the locks on bathroom doors to prevent the person from accidentally locking himself or herself in. Use childproof latches on kitchen cabinets and anyplace where cleaning supplies or other chemicals are kept. Label medications and keep them locked up. Also make sure knives, lighters and matches, and guns are secured and out of reach. Keep the house free from clutter. Remove scatter rugs and anything else that might contribute to a fall. Make sure lighting is good both inside and outside the home. Be alert to and address kitchen-safety issues, such as the person forgetting to turn off the stove after cooking. Consider installing an automatic shut-off switch on the stove to preventburns or fire. Be sure to secure or put away anything that could cause danger, both inside and outside the home."
Driving: Decisions for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Making the decision that a person with Alzheimer's is no longer safe to drive is difficult, and it needs to be communicated carefully and sensitively. Even though the person may be upset by the loss of independence, safety must be the priority."" Look for clues that safe driving is no longer possible, including getting lost in familiar places, driving too fast or too slow, disregarding traffic signs, or getting angry or confused. Be sensitive to the person's feelings about losing the ability to drive, but be firm in your request that he or she no longer do so. Be consistent—don't allow the person to drive on ""good days"" but forbid it on ""bad days."" Ask the doctor to help. The person may view the doctor as an authority and be willing to stop driving. The doctor also can contact the Department of Motor Vehicles and request that the person be reevaluated. If necessary, take the car keys. If just having keys is important to the person, substitute a different set of keys. If all else fails, disable the car or move it to a location where the person cannot see it or gain access to it. Ask family or friends to drive the person or find out about services that help people with disabilities get around their community. "
Visiting the Doctor with a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""It is important that the person with Alzheimer's disease receive regular medical care. Advance planning can help the trip to the doctor's office go more smoothly."" Try to schedule the appointment for the person's best time of day. Also, ask the office staff what time of day the office is least crowded. Let the office staff know in advance that this person may be confused because of Alzheimer's disease. Ask them for help to make the visit go smoothly. Don't tell the person about the appointment until the day of the visit or even shortly before it is time to go. Be positive and matter-of-fact. Bring along something for the person to eat and drink and any materials or activities that he or she enjoys. Have a friend or another family member go with you on the trip, so that one of you can be with the person while the other speaks with the doctor. Take a brief summary listing the person's medical history, primary care doctor, and current medications. "
Coping with Holidays for Caregivers and a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Holidays are bittersweet for many Alzheimer's disease caregivers. The happy memories of the past contrast with the difficulties of the present, and extra demands on time and energy can seem overwhelming. Finding a balance between rest and activity can help."" Keep or adapt family traditions that are important to you. Include the person with Alzheimer's as much as possible. Recognize that things will be different, and be realistic about what you can do. Encourage friends and family to visit. Limit the number of visitors at one time, and try to schedule visits during the time of day when the person is at his or her best. Avoid crowds, changes in routine, and strange places that may cause confusion or agitation. Do your best to enjoy yourself. Try to find time for the holiday things you like to do. Ask a friend or family member to spend time with the person while you are out. At larger gatherings such as weddings or family reunions, try to have a space available where the person can rest, be alone, or spend some time with a smaller number of people, if needed. "
Visiting a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"""Visitors are important to people with Alzheimer's. They may not always remember who the visitors are, but the human connection has value. Here are some ideas to share with someone who is planning to visit a person with the disease."" Plan the visit for the time of day when the person with Alzheimer's is at his or her best. Consider bringing along an activity, such as something familiar to read or photo albums to look at, but be prepared to skip it if necessary. Be calm and quiet. Avoid using a loud tone of voice or talking to the person as if he or she were a child. Respect the person's personal space and don't get too close. Try to establish eye contact and call the person by name to get his or her attention. Remind the person who you are if he or she doesn't seem to recognize you. Don't argue if the person is confused. Respond to the feelings you hear being communicated, and distract the person to a different topic if necessary. Remember not to take it personally if the person doesn't recognize you, is unkind, or responds angrily. He or she is reacting out of confusion. "
Choosing a Nursing Home for a Person with Alzheimer's Disease,"'For many caregivers, there comes a point when they are no longer able to take care of their loved one at home. Choosing a residential care facility—a group home, assisted living facility, or ''nursing'' home—is a big decision, and it can be hard to know where to start.'  It's helpful to gather information about services and options before the need actually arises. This gives you time to explore fully all the possibilities before making a decision. Determine what facilities are in your area. Doctors, friends and relatives, hospital social workers, and religious organizations may be able to help you identify specific facilities. Make a list of questions you would like to ask the staff. Think about what is important to you, such as activity programs, transportation, or special units for people with Alzheimer's disease. Contact the places that interest you and make an appointment to visit. Talk to the administration, nursing staff, and residents. Observe the way the facility runs and how residents are treated. You may want to drop by again unannounced to see if your impressions are the same. Find out what kinds of programs and services are offered for people with Alzheimer's and their families. Ask about staff training in dementia care, and check to see what the policy is about family participation in planning patient care. Check on room availability, cost and method of payment, and participation in Medicare or Medicaid. You may want to place your name on a waiting list even if you are not ready to make an immediate decision about long-term care. Once you have made a decision, be sure you understand the terms of the contract and financial agreement. You may want to have a lawyer review the documents with you before signing. Moving is a big change for both the person with Alzheimer's disease and the caregiver. A social worker may be able to help you plan for and adjust to the move. It is important to have support during this difficult transition."

What is Alzheimer's disease?,"""Alzheimer's""' disease (also termed Alzheimer disease) is a progressive mental deterioration that can occur in middle-aged individuals, but usually occurs in individuals that are about 60 to 65 years old or older. Early or younger onset Alzheimer’s can occur in individuals aged about 40 – 65. The disease is due to generalized deterioration of brain function related to plaques that develop in the brain tissue. The cause of '""Alzheimer's"""" is unknown. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of premature ""'senility'"". In 214, as many as 5 million Americans age 65 and older had Alzheimer's and approximately 200,000 individuals have younger or early onset Alzheimer's disease. Statisticians predict by 2060 about 14 million people will have Alzheimer’s disease."" "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and stages of Alzheimer's disease?","""Although the course of Alzheimer's disease varies from person to person, several stages are recognized. How many stages are recognized depends on what expert you consult (described stages may range from 3 to 7). Almost all experts agree that there at least three major stages:""""Those experts that list up to seven stages do so by breaking the three stages into subsets (for example, the severe stage is broken into severe decline and very severe decline). These stages are defined by certain signs and symptoms. The object of this article is to list those signs and symptoms that usually appear in these stages. Unfortunately, some people with Alzheimer's disease may have some symptoms that may cross over stages.""'People with Alzheimer\'s disease, family members, and others are often told that the affected person has mild, moderate or severe disease. However, others are told they are in one of seven Alzheimer\'s stages (stages previously used by some physicians and other health-care professionals). This seven stage designation is termed the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). A few other experts even break down the seven stages into subsets (for example, stage into 6a -6f). Moreover, the stages have various names depending on who is describing them. Consequently, people can be confused if they hear about various ""stages"" of Alzheimer\'s disease. In an effort to clarify the situation, all seven Global Deterioration Scale will be presented along with their names (subsets will not be presented) and then each Global Deterioration Scale stage will then be rated as mild, moderate or severe.''The Alzheimer Association provides a list of 10 ""early"" signs and symptoms of Alzheimer\'s disease; they are:''Although some of the signs and symptoms may appear occasionally with age-related changes and not be due to Alzheimer’s disease, if the above signs and symptoms cause anyone to worry about a potential diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, the individual should be seen and evaluated by a health-care professional.' mild (early stage), moderate (middle stage), and severe (late stage). Reduced ability in planning or problem-solving Difficulty completing familiar tasks done at home, work or at leisure Confusion due to loss of understanding of dates and time Difficulty understanding visual images and spatial relationships Memory loss that disrupts daily life Problems with speaking or writing Misplacing things in unusual places and not being able to retrace steps to find items Decreasing judgment and/or poor judgment when dealing with finances and/or personal hygiene Avoiding work and/or social activities Changes in personality, behavior, and mood."
Stage 1: No impairment,"'Global Deterioration Scale stage 1 of Alzheimer\'s disease is termed ""no impairment,"" which means that the person has no noticeable symptoms, and is fully independent with no memory or reasoning problems (mild Alzheimer\'s disease).'   No noticeable memory problems No noticeable reasoning problems"
Stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline,"'Stage 2 of early Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease is termed ""very mild cognitive decline."" The signs and symptoms of the second stage of Alzheimer\'s disease are:'""Usually, these patients can function socially and at work (mild Alzheimer's disease)."" Mild memory loss Forgetting names of known individuals Minor problems with concentration"
Stage 3: Mild cognitive decline,"'Deterioration Scale stage 3 of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""mild cognitive decline,"" is characterized by worsening of the first and second Global Deterioration Scale stage symptoms and also can include:'""Family members and co-workers may begin to notice these changes, but many people remain undiagnosed at this stage (mild Alzheimer's disease). "" Forgetting new information Declining work performance Difficulty with making future plans  Becoming less able to organize Repeating questions"
Stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline,"'Stage 4 of the Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease, termed ""moderate decline,"" like the third stage, involves worsening of the conditions seen in previous stages. For example, ''memory loss'"" and memory deficits become more prominent and difficulties with complex actions become more obvious. Other examples of symptoms of the fourth stage of Alzheimer's disease include:""'Since the above problems become prominent and ''mood swings'"" are usually out of character for the individual, this is the stage when most of the people have theirs doctors diagnose them with Alzheimer's disease (moderate Alzheimer's disease).""  Difficulties with complex actions (for example, balancing the checkbook) Cannot plan ahead easily Mood changes and/or mood swings May become depressed May become withdrawn from social contacts May shun challenging situations (for example, family money matters)"
Stage 5: Moderately severe decline,"'Stage 5 of Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease, termed ""moderately severe decline,"" is determined when the individual is no longer able to do routine tasks without some assistance. Typical problems of the previous stages become worse; added to these problems are the patient\'s inability to remember to do common daily tasks (moderate Alzheimer\'s disease), for example, the person:' May have difficulty remembering common information (for example, home address or phone number) Can no longer do routine tasks such as making a meal without some assistance May become disoriented to time or place Has a noticeable decline in personal hygiene habits, for example, brushing the teeth and/or bathroom hygiene"
Stage 6: Severe decline,"'In stage 6 of the Global Deterioration Scale of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""severe decline,"" all of the problems seen in the other 5 stages considerably worsen, especially memory (severe Alzheimer\'s disease), for example:'   Daily activities such as getting dressed are compromised. Affected individuals forget the names of people they should know (for example the names of their spouses and/or children). The personality changes of the person become more pronounced and may include paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions. Affected individuals will require personal help with daily tasks including personal hygiene (for example, they may not be able to take a shower unless assisted). Many people with Alzheimer's disease will need monitoring as some will walk out of their residence and become lost. "
Stage 7: Very severe decline,"'In Global Deterioration Scale stage 7 of Alzheimer\'s disease termed ""very severe decline,"" affected individuals have declined so much that they require continual assistance to carry out basic activities such as getting out of the chair or feeding themselves (severe Alzheimer\'s disease). Those people affected:' Can decline so far that they may not be able to talk or respond to their environment Will not be able to control muscle movement That talk may have only meaningless verbiage May not be able to even sit without support, while others may become rigid Eventually will not be able to swallow foods and/or liquids"
Conclusion," Individuals usually are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease during the moderate stages of the disease (stage 2 of 3 in the simplified staging system or Global Deterioration Scale stage 4 to 7). The disease is progressive and progresses at different rates with varying symptoms in each individual diagnosed with this disease. Treatment methods may vary with each individual according to their stage and severity of symptoms. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but treatments may help reduce or slow the development of the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Staging may help family, caregivers, and friends to better understand what Alzheimer's disease is doing to the individual."
What are antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)?,"'Between 95 and 98% of patients with ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' (''PBC'') have autoantibodies (antibodies to self) in their blood that react with the inner lining of mitochondria. These autoantibodies are called antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Mitochondria are the energy factories present inside all of our cells, not just the cells of the ''liver'' or bile ducts. (The mitochondria use the oxygen carried in the blood from the ''lungs'' as a fuel to generate energy.) AMA actually bind to protein antigens that are contained in multienzyme complexes (packages of enzymes) within the inner lining of the mitochondria. These multienzyme complexes produce key chemical reactions necessary for life. The complexes are referred to as multienzyme because they are made up of multiple enzyme units.''AMA specifically react against a component of this multienzyme complex called E2. In PBC, AMA preferentially react with the E2 component of one of the multienzymes that is called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Accordingly, the antigen is designated as PDC-E2. The practical importance of all of this is that the PDC-E2 antigen is now used, as discussed below, in a diagnostic test for PBC. The PDC-E2 antigen is also referred to as M2, a term introduced to designate it as the second mitochondrial antigen discovered by researchers interested in PBC.'  "
Do AMA cause the destruction of the bile ducts in PBC?,"'In as much as the bile ducts are the main targets of destruction in PBC, the question was asked whether the AMA reacts with the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts. So, investigators prepared antibodies to PDC-E2. As expected, they found that these antibodies bound to the mitochondria within the cells. But, sure enough, recent information suggests that these AMA autoantibodies also bind to PDC-E2 that lies outside the mitochondria, yet within the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts.''This accumulation of PDC-E2 within the biliary epithelial cells is observed exclusively in the livers of patients with PBC, and not in normal livers or in livers from patients with any other types of ''liver disease''. Interestingly, it was also observed in the livers of those two to five percent of PBC patients who do not have AMA in their blood (AMA-negative PBC). Furthermore, intense binding of these antibodies to biliary epithelial cells was also found to be the earliest indication of recurrence of PBC in a transplanted liver. (PBC is sometimes treated by liver transplantation.)''Nevertheless, no evidence exists that the AMA itself causes the destruction of the biliary epithelial cells lining the small bile ducts. Neither the presence nor the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood appears to be related to the inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts. Indeed, immunization of animals with PDC-E2 antigen results in production of AMA without any liver or bile duct damage (pathology).' "
How is the blood test for AMA done?,"""The most economical test for AMA applies diluted samples of a patient's serum onto tissue sections from rat stomach or kidney in the laboratory. (Remember that mitochondria are present in virtually all cells, not just the cells of the liver and bile ducts.) Serum antibodies that attach (bind) to mitochondrial membranes within the tissue cells can then be observed with a microscope. The most dilute sample of serum showing this binding reaction is reported, using the term titer. The titer indicates the most dilute serum sample that reacts with the tissue mitochondria. A higher titer means there is a greater amount of AMA in the serum.""'The antigen recognized by AMA in patients with PBC is now known to be PDC-E2 and is also often referred to as the M2 antigen. So, newly developed tests for antibodies that bind to PDC-E2 are more specific and are now available to confirm the diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is the value of the AMA blood test?,"'AMA are detectable in the serum in 95 to 98% of patients with PBC. So, AMA are tremendously important as a diagnostic marker in patients with PBC. The AMA titers in PBC are almost universally greater than or equal to 1 to 40. This means that a serum sample diluted with 40 times its original volume still contains enough antimitochondrial antibodies to be detected in the binding reaction. A positive AMA with a titer of at least 1:40 in an adult with an elevated ''alkaline phosphatase'' in the blood is highly specific for a diagnosis of PBC.' "
What Causes Amblyopia?,"'Amblyopia is usually starts when one eye has much better focus than the other eye. For example, one eye might be very nearsighted or have a lot of ''astigmatism'' , while the other does not. When the child\'s brain is confronted with both a blurry image and a clear image, it will begin to ignore the blurry image. If this goes on for months or years, the vision in the eye that sees the blurry image will start to deteriorate even further. Another possible result of the brain ignoring the poorly functioning eye is a change in the alignment of the eyes, with the poorly seeing eye turning inwards or outwards. This is why amblyopia is sometimes called ""''lazy eye''.""''Another form of lazy eye that can cause amblyopia is called ''strabismus''. ''Strabismus'' or ''ocular'' misalignment prevents the eyes from focusing together on an image. This can cause ''double vision'"". In order to combat this, the child's brain generally chooses to ignore the image from the deviated eye, causing the vision in that eye to eventually deteriorate.""'Other children cannot see well in one eye because there something blocks light from getting through. This could be due, among other causes, to a ''cataract'' or a small amount of blood or other material in the back of the eye.' "
How Is Amblyopia Diagnosed?,"""Your child's pediatrician or the vision program at school will check three aspects of your child's eye health:"" That your child's eyes let light all the way through That both eyes see equally well That the eyes are moving normally."
How Is Amblyopia Treated?,"'The most common treatment for amblyopia is to force the brain to start using the ""bad"" eye by putting a patch over the ""good"" eye. At first, the child will have a hard time seeing with just the weaker eye. However, it is very important that your child wear the patch diligently because this will eventually improve vision. It can take weeks, months, or even a year for an eye patch to improve vision.''As the child keeps using only the eye with amblyopia, his or her vision will continue to improve. After the doctor determines that vision is back to normal, your child will not have to wear the patch. In cases of mild amblyopia, the doctor might recommend using an eye drop called ''atropine'' in the ""good"" eye instead of a patch. Atropine makes it impossible for that eye to focus close-up, forcing the ""bad"" eye to do most of the work while the child is playing with toys, eating, drawing or reading.''If there is something blocking light from getting into the eye, the doctor might recommend surgery to remove the blockage. If ''strabismus'' is preventing the eyes from moving together correctly, your doctor might recommend surgery on the muscles of the eye. And if the focus of one eye is very different from the other, ''eyeglasses'' or ''contact lenses'' might be necessary.''Your doctor will discuss with you what treatment is most appropriate for your child.' "
What Is the Outlook for Children With Amblyopia?,"'If existing underlying problems are treated and the amblyopia is detected and treated early, most children will regain normal vision. Amblyopia becomes much more difficult to treat after about 6 years of age. Also, if there is too much vision lost in the eye with amblyopia, it might be impossible to get it all back.'""It is important that you follow your doctor's advice about treatment. This can be very difficult, because many children do not want to wear an eye patch every day. But with the establishment of atropine as an alternative method of treatment, success is now possible in a larger proportion of children with amblyopia.""'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.' "
What is amebiasis?,"'Amebiasis is a parasitic disease (also known as amebic dysentery or amoebic dysentery and/or amoebiasis) caused by infection with ''Entamoeba histolytica'' or another amoeba (for example, ''E. dispar''). Most individuals with the disease may have no symptoms. ''E. histolytica'' is the species that produces symptoms only in about 10% of those infected. The single or one-celled, flash-shaped or shifting shaped organism usually produces dysentery and occasionally invasive extra intestinal problems (invasive amebiasis), the most common of which are ''liver'' abscesses, although other organs can be involved. The disease is most common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. It is estimated that amebiasis causes 50,000-100,000 deaths worldwide each year.' "
What causes amebiasis?,"'The cause of amebiasis is infection by the protozoan parasite ''Entamoeba histolytica''. It begins when a person ''drinks'' contaminated water or eats foods contaminated with the cystic form (infective stage), comes in contact with contaminated colonic irrigation devices or the fecally contaminated hands of food handlers, or by oral-anal sexual practices.''The cystic form changes into trophozoites (invasive form) in the ilium or colon and invade the mucosal barrier, leading to tissue destruction and ''diarrhea''. These trophozoites can reach the portal blood circulation to the ''liver'' and eventually go to other organs. It only infects humans, and the CDC does not classify it as a free-living organism.' "
What are risk factors for amebiasis?,"'Risk factors include' drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated foods, association with food handlers whose hands are contaminated, anal sexual practices, contaminated medical devices such as colonic irrigation devices, malnourishment, recipients of corticosteroids, pregnancy, very young patients, and travelers to endemic areas such as Southeast Asia or Central America."
What is the incubation period for amebiasis?,"'The incubation period for amebiasis is variable. Symptoms begin to appear in about one to four weeks after ingestion of the ''cysts''; however, the range may be from a few days to years.' "
"Is amebiasis contagious? If so, what is the contagious period for amebiasis?","'Yes, amebiasis is contagious person to person. It is spread by the fecal-oral route by an infected person. The contagious period lasts as long as the infected patient excretes cysts in their stools. Consequently, the contagious period may last for weeks to many years if untreated.' "
What are amebiasis symptoms and signs?,"'Although only about 10%-20% of people infected with the parasites become ill, those individuals may produce the following symptoms and signs:'   Early symptoms (in about 1-4 weeks) include loose stools and mild abdominal cramping If the disease progresses, frequent, watery, and/or bloody stools with severe abdominal cramping (termed amoebic dysentery) may occur. If the trophozoites reach the intestinal walls and go through them, symptoms of liver infection such as liver tenderness and fever are the initial signs and symptoms of liver abscess formation (hepatic amebiasis). Other organs (heart, lungs, brain [meningoencephalitis], for example) may produce symptoms specific to the organ and produce severe illness and/or death. Abdominal tenderness and/or stomach pain Tenesmus Flatulence Appetite loss Weight loss Fatigue Anemia Occasionally cause skin lesions (cutaneous amebiasis)"
What specialists treat amebiasis?,"'In addition to your primary care physician, the following specialists may be consulted:' Gastroenterologist Infectious disease specialist General surgeon (especially if the patient develops severe disease like fulminant colitis) Occasionally, dermatologist"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose amebiasis?,"'If your recent health history and travel history suggests a possibility of amebiasis, your doctor may ask you to provide several ''stool'' samples to screen for the presence of ''E. histolytica'' cysts in your stools. In addition, some routine blood tests as well as other tests to determine if parasites spread to other organs may be initiated for laboratory diagnosis. These tests may include the following:' Liver function tests Serological tests Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Ultrasound of the liver CT scan of the liver and perhaps other organs Colonoscopy of the large intestine to search for parasites Your doctor may run other serological tests to rule out other infectious diseases like giardiasis, paragonimiasis, and arboviral brain infections, for example."
What are medical treatment options for amebiasis?,"'Asymptomatic infections are not treated unless they are occurring in non-endemic areas. If patients are shedding ''E. histolytica'' cysts, the following luminal agents (''drugs'' that work on cysts that are not invading the gastrointestinal epithelium) are as follows:''To treat invasive amebiasis, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'', ''MetroGel'', ''Noritate'') is recommended even for amoebic liver abscesses (up to 10 cm sized abscesses). Tinidazole (Tindamax) is FDA approved for treatment of both intestinal or extraintestinal (invasive) amebiasis. Other countries have similar ''drugs'' for treatments, but they are not available in the United States.''Amoebic ''colitis'' can be treated with nitroimidazoles, but they should be followed up by a luminal agent.''Treatment of hepatic amebiasis has been successful in some patients with ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or dehydroemetine (which is only available from the CDC and is not a preferred treatment because of potential heart toxicity).''If the gastrointestinal tract is suspected to be perforated (perforation can occur with fulminant amoebic colitis), broad-spectrum antibiotics may be used to prevent ''peritonitis''.'  Paromomycin (Humatin) Iodoquinol (Yodoxin) Diloxanide furoate"
What are surgical treatment options for amebiasis?,'Surgical treatments are required or indicated for amebiasis treatment due to the following:' Gastrointestinal bleeding (massive or uncontrolled) Perforated amoebic colitis Toxic megacolon Failure to respond to metronidazole after four days of treatment Amoebic liver abscesses greater than 10 cm in size Empyema after the liver abscess rupture Amoebic liver abscess representing risk of rupture to the pericardium Impending abscess rupture (no medical response in about 3-5 days to expanding abscess) Percutaneous drainage by catheter can be lifesaving in patients with amoebic pericarditis
Are there home remedies for amebiasis?,"'There are many home remedies for amebiasis available on the Internet. They range from increased fluid intake, coconut water, buttermilk, black tea, and herbal tea to ''garlic'', Indian lilac, oregano, and apple cider vinegar. If you think you have amebiasis, you should discuss your symptoms with a doctor before trying any self-treatment remedies.' "
What are complications of amebiasis?,"'Although infrequent, there can be serious complications of the disease. They include' liver abscesses (it is possible to develop these abscesses without the typical diarrhea stage), lung abscesses, brain abscesses, ameboma (a large local lesion of the bowel caused by the response to the infecting parasite), fulminant or necrotizing colitis, rectal rational fistula, bloody dysentery, toxic megacolon, increased risk for cancer, and death."
Is it possible to prevent amebiasis?,"'Yes, amebiasis can be prevented by stopping the fecal contamination of food and water by the Centers for Disease Control personnel by correcting poor sanitation. Identification and treatment of food handlers or other carriers of the parasite can reduce the chance of getting food-borne amebiasis. Avoiding sexual practices that involve fecal-oral contact also may reduce the chance of getting the disease. Avoiding malnutrition and ''alcohol'' use can reduce risk of the disease.'""Gal-lectin, an antigen from the parasite, has been used as a vaccine to protect animals against intestinal amebiasis and against amoebic liver abscesses. Other parasitic components are being tried as possible vaccine components to use in humans. Unfortunately, amebiasis doesn't result in any long-term immunity so that individuals can be reinfected multiple times."" "
What is the prognosis of amebiasis? What is the recovery time for amebiasis?,"'In general, the prognosis of amebiasis is good since the vast majority of infected individuals showed little or no symptoms. However, if complications develop such as abscesses, ''peritonitis'', or toxic megacolon, the prognosis may vary from fair to poor depending on the availability of medical support services.''Recovery time for amebiasis is related to the severity of the disease. If a person has no symptoms, there is no recovery time. Recovery time after medical treatment varies from about 1-2 weeks to as many as four weeks or more after surgery. You and your doctor need to discuss your estimated recovery time once treatment begins.' "
Facts you should know about amenorrhea," Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstrual periods; it may be either primary (meaning a woman never developed menstrual periods) or secondary (absence of menstrual periods in a woman who was previously menstruating). Genetic or inborn conditions are the most common causes of primary amenorrhea. Amenorrhea may result from disorders of the ovaries, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, or uterus. Intensive exercising, extreme weight loss, physical illness, and stress can all result in amenorrhea. Amenorrhea is a symptom and not a disease in itself, so amenorrhea can be prevented only to the extent that the underlying cause can be prevented. Infertility and possible bone loss (osteoporosis) are complications of amenorrhea. Treatments may include surgical correction of anatomical abnormalities, medications or hormone therapies, and treatment of any underlying conditions responsible for amenorrhea. The outlook for amenorrhea varies according to the cause of the amenorrhea."
Definition of primary and secondary amenorrhea,"'Amenorrhea is the medical term for the absence of menstrual periods, either on a permanent or temporary basis. Amenorrhea can be classified as primary or secondary. In primary amenorrhea, menstrual periods have never begun (by age 16), whereas secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstrual periods for three consecutive cycles or a time period of more than six months in a woman who was previously menstruating.''The ''menstrual cycle'' can be influenced by many internal factors such as transient changes in hormonal levels, ''stress'', and illness, as well as external or environmental factors. Missing one ''menstrual period'' is rarely a sign of a serious problem or an underlying medical condition, but amenorrhea of longer duration may signal the presence of a disease or chronic condition.'  "
What causes amenorrhea?,"'The normal ''menstrual cycle'' occurs because of changing levels of hormones made and secreted by the ovaries. The ovaries respond to hormonal signals from the ''pituitary gland'"" located at the brain's base, which, in turn, is controlled by hormones produced in the hypothalamus of the brain. Disorders that affect any component of this regulatory cycle can lead to amenorrhea. However, a common cause of amenorrhea in young females sometimes overlooked or misunderstood by the individual and others, is an undiagnosed ""'pregnancy''. Amenorrhea in ''pregnancy'' is a normal physiological function. Occasionally, the same underlying problem can cause or contribute to either primary or secondary amenorrhea. For example, hypothalamic problems, ''anorexia'' or extreme ''exercise'"" can play a major role in causing amenorrhea depending on the person's age and if she has experienced menarche.""'Primary amenorrhea is typically the result of a genetic or anatomic condition in young females that never develop menstrual periods (by age 16) and is not ''pregnant''. Many genetic conditions that are characterized by amenorrhea are circumstances in which some or all of the normal internal female organs either fail to form normally during ''fetal development'' or fail to function properly. Diseases of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus (a region of the brain important for the control of hormone production) can also cause primary amenorrhea since these areas play a critical role in the regulation of ovarian hormones.''Gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which the ovaries are prematurely depleted of follicles and oocytes (egg cells), leads to premature failure of the ovaries. It is one of the most common cases of primary amenorrhea in young women.''Another genetic cause is ''Turner syndrome'', in which women are lacking all or part of one of the two X chromosomes normally present in the female. In ''Turner syndrome'', the ovaries are replaced by ''scar tissue'' and ''estrogen'' production is minimal, resulting in amenorrhea. Estrogen-induced maturation of the external female genitalia and sex characteristics also fails to occur in ''Turner syndrome''.''Other conditions that may be causes of primary amenorrhea include ''androgen'' insensitivity (in which individuals have XY (male) chromosomes but do not develop the external characteristics of males due to a lack of response to testosterone and its effects), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and ''polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS'').''Pregnancy is an obvious cause of amenorrhea and is the most common reason for secondary amenorrhea. Further causes are varied and may include conditions that affect the ovaries, uterus, hypothalamus, or pituitary gland.''Hypothalamic amenorrhea is due to a disruption in the regulator hormones produced by the hypothalamus in the brain. These hormones influence the pituitary gland, which in turn sends signals to the ovaries to produce the characteristic cyclic hormones. A number of conditions can affect the hypothalamus:''Other types of medical conditions can cause secondary amenorrhea:''Women who have stopped taking oral ''contraceptive'' pills should experience the return of ''menstruation'' within three months after discontinuing pill use. Previously, it was believed that ''birth control pills'"" increased a woman's risk of amenorrhea following use of ""'the pill'', but this has been proven not to be the case. Women who do not resume ''menstruation'' after three months have passed since oral ''contraceptive'' pills were stopped should be evaluated for causes of secondary amenorrhea.' extreme weight loss, emotional or physical stress, rigorous exercise, and severe illness. tumors or other diseases of the pituitary gland that lead to elevated levels of the hormone prolactin (which is involved in milk production) also cause amenorrhea due to the elevated prolactin levels; hypothyroidism; elevated levels of androgens (male hormones), either from outside sources or from disorders that cause the body to produce too high levels of male hormones; ovarian failure (premature ovarian failure or early menopause); polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and Asherman's syndrome, a uterine disease that results from scarring of the uterine lining following instrumentation (such as dilation and curettage) of the uterine cavity to manage postpartum bleeding or infection."
What are amenorrhea symptoms and signs?,"'Primary or secondary amenorrhea (respectively) is considered to be present when a girl has:''Other symptoms and signs may be present, which are highly variable and depend upon the underlying cause of the amenorrhea. For example, symptoms of hormonal imbalance or male hormone excess can include irregular menstrual periods, unwanted hair growth, deepening of the voice, and ''acne''. Elevated prolactin levels as a cause of amenorrhea can result in galactorrhea (a milky discharge from the nipples that is not related to normal ''breastfeeding'').'   not developed menstrual periods by age 16; or a woman who has previously had a menstrual cycle stops having menstrual periods for three cycles in a row, or for a time period of six months or more and is not pregnant."
When should I seek medical care for amenorrhea?,"'It is always appropriate to seek medical attention for amenorrhea. Amenorrhea that is not related to pregnancy or the menopausal transition (time when there has been no menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months and no other biological or physiological cause can be identified, and the female is at the end of her biologically-determined child bearing years) should be further investigated to rule out serious conditions that may result in amenorrhea.' "
How do doctors diagnose amenorrhea?,"'The diagnosis of amenorrhea requires a careful medical history to document the presence of amenorrhea as well as any other coexisting medical conditions that may be the cause of amenorrhea. A physical examination, including a pelvic examination is also performed.''Depending upon the results of the history and physical examination further diagnostic tests may be ordered. Blood tests may be ordered to examine the levels of ovarian, pituitary, and ''thyroid'' hormones. These tests may include measurements of prolactin, ''follicle-stimulating hormone'' (FSH), estrogen, thyrotropin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and testosterone. For some individuals, a ''pregnancy test'' is the first test performed.''Imaging studies, such as ''ultrasound'', X-ray, and CT or ''MRI'' scanning may also be recommended in certain individuals to help establish the cause of amenorrhea.'  "
What is the treatment for amenorrhea?,"'Treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhea is determined by the specific cause. Treatment goals can be to relieve symptoms of hormonal imbalance, establish ''menstruation'', prevent complications, and/or to achieve ''fertility'', although not all of these goals can be achieved in every case.''In cases in which genetic or anatomical abnormalities are the cause of amenorrhea (typically primary amenorrhea), surgery may be recommended.''Hypothalamic amenorrhea that is related to ''weight loss'', excessive ''exercise'', physical illness, or emotional ''stress'' can typically be corrected by addressing the underlying cause. For example, ''weight gain'' and reduction in intensity of ''exercise'' can usually restore menstrual periods in women who have developed amenorrhea due to ''weight loss'' or overly intensive exercise who do not have additional causes of amenorrhea. In some cases, nutritional counseling may be of benefit.''In ''premature ovarian failure'', ''hormone therapy'' may be recommended both to avoid the unpleasant symptoms of estrogen depletion as well as prevent complications (see below) of low estrogen level such as ''osteoporosis''. This may consist of oral contraceptive pills for those women who do not desire pregnancy or alternative estrogen and ''progesterone'' medications. While ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'' has been associated with certain health risks in older women, younger women with premature ovarian failure can benefit from this therapy to prevent bone loss.''Women with ''PCOS'' (polycystic ovary syndrome) may benefit from treatments that reduce the level or activity of male hormones, or androgens.''Dopamine'' agonist medications such as ''bromocriptine'' (''Parlodel'"") can reduce elevated prolactin levels, which may be responsible for amenorrhea. Consequently, medication levels may be adjusted by the person's physician if appropriate.""'Assisted reproductive technologies and the administration of gonadotropin medications (''drugs'' that stimulate follicle maturation in the ovaries) can be appropriate for women with some types of amenorrhea who wish to attempt to become pregnant.''While many companies and individuals have marketed herbal therapies as a treatment for amenorrhea, none of these have been conclusively proved to be of benefit. These therapies are not regulated by the U.S. FDA and the quality of herbal preparations is not tested. Herbal remedies have been associated with serious and even fatal side effects in rare cases, and some preparations have been shown to contain high levels of toxins. Before deciding to take a natural or alternative remedy for amenorrhea, it is wise to seek the advice of your health care practitioner.'  "
What are the complications of amenorrhea?,"'Infertility'' is a significant complication of amenorrhea for women who desire to become pregnant. ''Osteopenia'' (a reduction in ''bone density'') or ''osteoporosis'' is a complication of low estrogen levels, which may occur with prolonged amenorrhea. Other complications of amenorrhea depend upon the underlying cause of the amenorrhea.' "
Is it possible to prevent amenorrhea?,"'Amenorrhea is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Therefore, amenorrhea can be prevented only to the extent that the underlying cause can be prevented. For example, amenorrhea that results from genetic or inborn conditions cannot be prevented. On the other hand, amenorrhea that results from self-imposed stringent ''dieting'' or intensive exercise is typically preventable.' "
What is the outlook for a woman suffering from amenorrhea?,"'The outlook for amenorrhea varies widely and is dependent upon the cause of the amenorrhea. Hypothalamic amenorrhea that is a result of stress, exercise, or ''weight loss'' generally can be corrected if the responsible factors can be corrected. Medical and hormonal therapies can be of great benefit in preventing unpleasant side effects or complications of amenorrhea in many women. ' "
What is the definition of homocysteine? What is it?,"'Homocysteine is an amino acid produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body. Most labs report normal ranges of homocysteine as about 4-15 µml/L.''Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a ''genetic disorder'' called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced ''atherosclerosis'' in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
What are hyperhomycysteinemia and homocystinuria? Are they inherited (genetic)?,"'Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a genetic disorder called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced atherosclerosis in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
"How many people have elevated homocysteine levels, and who gets the condition?","'Mild elevation in homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia) are common, and seen in about 5% to 12% of the general population. In specific populations such as, alcoholics (due to poor vitamin intake) or patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', this may be more common. The severe genetic form, homocystinuria, is rare (0.02%).'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria?,"'Homocystinuria has a constellation of signs and symptoms that include:'  Developmental delay Osteoporosis (thin bones) Visual abnormalities Formation of blood clots Advanced atherosclerosis or narrowing and hardening of blood vessels, a type of heart disease."
What are the more common causes of hyperhomocysteinemia?,"'More common causes of elevated homocysteine levels in the blood are milder genetic variations of homocystinuria. In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of a minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels (above 15 µmol/L), although much milder than in homocystinuria (above 100 µmol/L), by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.' "
How can homocysteine levels be lowered?,"'Eating cereals that are fortified with ''folic acid'', and to a lesser extent ''vitamins'' B6 and B12, can lower blood homocysteine levels. These ''supplements'' may even be beneficial in people with mild genetic hyperhomocysteinemia to lower their homocysteine levels. However, it is noteworthy that so far there is no compelling data to support the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia for ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' or treatment of known ''heart disease'' or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with ''heart'' disease (atherosclerosis) or other diseases.'  "
Who should get tested for elevated homocysteine levels? How is it treated?,"'Currently, there are no official recommendations as to who should undergo testing for homocysteine blood levels. Before data that are more scientific become available from the currently ongoing studies, many experts do not recommend a screening test for blood homocysteine levels, even in patients with unexplained ''blood clot'' formation. In addition, the consensus recommendation is against treating elevated homocysteine levels with ''vitamins'' to prevent heart disease. Rarely, a few specialists may test for elevated homocysteine levels in patients with early onset of ''blood clot'' formation, ''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', or other symptoms related to atherosclerosis, especially if these patients do not have typical risk factors, such as ''smoking'' cigarettes, ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', or high LDL ''cholesterol levels'' and they suspect genetic causes''There is also no consensus as to the optimal dose of folic acid and other B vitamins for the treatment of elevated blood homocysteine levels. (For example, treatment of patients with high homocysteine levels may require higher doses of folic acid and other B vitamins than the amounts contained in a multivitamin.) Therefore, a decision regarding testing should be individualized after consulting with your doctor and/or a specialist in genetic diseases. Some researchers recommend treatment guidelines that result in levels of homocysteine below 100 µmol/L but say the recommendation may change (possibly lowered) with new data.'  "
Does lowering homocysteine level prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'Currently, there is no direct proof that taking folic acid and B vitamins to lower homocysteine levels prevents ''heart attacks'' and strokes. However, in a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of ''multivitamins'') had fewer ''heart attacks'' than those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. In this study, the association between dietary intake of folate and vitamin B6 and risk of heart disease was more noticeable than between dietary intake of vitamin B12 and heart disease, which was minimal.''Many other observational studies have been performed to assess the effect of folate and the other B vitamins on heart disease. Most of these studies have concluded that oral intake of folate has been associated to lower risk of heart disease, possibly because due to lowering of homocysteine levels. The relation between oral intake of vitamin B12 and B6 and heart disease was not as obvious in many of these studies. In one study, it was concluded that even in people with elevated homocysteine levels due to genetic reasons, oral intake of folate and possibly the other B vitamins was related to lower incidence of heart disease.''Most of these data, however, are obtained from observational studies rather than purely controlled scientific data. Therefore, it is important to mention that despite these studies suggesting an association between the intake of these vitamins and the lower incidence of heart disease, in general, there is no compelling clinical evidence to treat hyperhomocysteinemia other than homocystinuria (the severe genetic form) in regards to heart disease, ''stroke'', or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with these problems.' "

What is amniocentesis?,"'Amniocentesis is a procedure wherein a sample of fluid is removed from the amniotic sac for analysis. The amniotic sac is found within the uterine ''cavity'"". The amniotic sac is the fluid-filled structure inside a pregnant woman's uterus within which the baby lives. Fetal cells, proteins, and fetal urine freely move within this sac.""""During amniocentesis, fluid is removed by placing a long needle through the abdominal wall into amniotic sac. Sometimes, the woman's skin is injected first with a local anesthetic, but this is not usually necessary. The amniocentesis needle is typically guided into the sac with the help of ""'ultrasound'' imaging performed either prior to or during the procedure. Once the needle is in the sac, a syringe is used to withdraw the clear amber-colored amniotic fluid, that resembles urine. The volume of fluid withdrawn depends upon the age of the fetus and the reason for the procedure.''The fluid can then be sent for evaluation of fetal lung maturity, genetic evaluation, evidence of ''spina bifida'' (a birth defect in spinal cord development) or other neural-tube defects, the presence of infection, or fetal chromosomal analysis. Chromosomes are structures which contain all of the genetic information within our cells. Amniotic fluid contains numerous free-floating fetal cells that can be grown in the laboratory. When these cells multiply and reach a certain number, their chromosomes are extracted and analyzed. It takes approximately two weeks to perform chromosomal analysis. The fluid also contains proteins, ''minerals'' and other compounds that can be tested. These additional studies may require 1 to 7 days to perform. Data obtained from amniotic fluid can help women make informed decisions regarding their ''pregnancies''.''For most patients, amniocentesis is a fairly rapid and comfortable procedure. Some women experience uterine cramping after the procedure. They may also feel faint during or following the test.'  "
Who is a candidate for amniocentesis?,"'Women over the age of 35 have an increased chance of having a baby with chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, the current recommendation is that women who will be age 35 or older at the time of delivery be offered a genetic amniocentesis for the testing of fetal chromosomes. Chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus can lead to intellectual disabilities or other ''birth defects'', as seen with '""Down's syndrome""'. The possibility of having a baby with a chromosomal defect increases with the age of the mother.''If there is a family history of chromosomal problems or history of prior births in which a chromosomal defect was identified, amniocentesis may be recommended. However, the exact benefit of amniocentesis in these situations is uncertain. Many chromosomal defects may not reappear in subsequent pregnancies, and ''genetic counseling'' can help a woman decide whether amniocentesis would be of value in these situations.' At age 35, the chance is about 1 in 178. By age 40, the rate increases to 1 in 63. By age 48, the ratio is 1 in 8. For women younger than 35, the risk of complications as a result of amniocentesis outweighs the possibility that the baby has a chromosomal abnormality (see below, ""Is Amniocentesis Safe?""). After 35, the chance of delivering a baby with a chromosomal abnormality may be more common than experiencing the complications associated with this procedure."
What does amniocentesis show?,"'Amniocentesis is very accurate in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and the gender of the fetus. Occasionally, the fetal cells harvested by amniocentesis do not grow in the culture, and no chromosomal data can be obtained. Additionally, \xa0physician may be unable to extract fluid from the uterus during amniocentesis due to a variety of technical reasons. In both instances, a subsequent extraction of fluid may be attempted.''Amniocentesis testing for ''lung maturity'' can help the doctor make decisions regarding timing of delivery for women in premature ''labor'', those with ''diabetes'', or other medical conditions requiring possible early delivery. Lung maturity testing is not perfect. In rare instances, a baby with lungs that are predicted to perform normally can still experience difficulty ''breathing''.''The AFP (alpha fetoprotein) blood test is currently available and can be used to screen for ''neural tube defects'' such as spina bifida, as well as '""Down's syndrome"""". An elevated AFP blood level may indicate the possibility that the fetus has a defect in the brain and/or spinal cord development. A low AFP level may indicate the potential for Down's syndrome. When abnormal blood levels of AFP are found, further evaluation with ultrasound and amniocentesis can be done to look for birth defects and chromosomal abnormalities.""'Amniocentesis can also help determine if there are specific ''genetic problems present in the fetus''. Testing for Tay-Sachs disease, ''cystic fibrosis'', ''sickle cell anemia'', and other ''inherited'' disorders can be performed on samples of amniotic fluid. Checking the cells for specific genes can now be done on the fetal cell cultures. It is also possible to look for a specific protein in the amniotic fluid that can signal a genetic abnormality. Testing for genetic (inherited) diseases is not routinely performed, but is available when necessary.''Another common reason for performing amniocentesis is to determine if the fetal lungs are mature enough so that the baby can be safely delivered before the due date. If the fetal lungs are not mature, an attempt can be made to stop premature ''labor'' with medications. If the lung tissues are mature, it may be safe for the premature baby to be born. This test can also help in the timing of delivery when the due date is uncertain.''Occasionally, a pregnant woman may have a ''fever'"" without an obvious site of infection. In these instances, an amniocentesis may be performed to determine if the cause of the mother's fever is from an ""'intrauterine infection''.''The overall possibility of birth defects in any pregnancy is approximately 3%. For defects such as ''cleft lip'', ''hernia'', and extra fingers or toes,\xa0amniocentesis will not be diagnostic. Ultrasound may be helpful in detecting these defects in the fetus.' "
When should amniocentesis be performed?,"'For genetic testing, chromosome analysis, and evaluation of an abnormal AFP test, amniocentesis is usually performed between the 15th and the 21st weeks of pregnancy. There is a higher rate of ''miscarriage'' associated with amniocentesis that is performed earlier than the 15th week. There is no time limit as to how late in the pregnancy amniocentesis can be performed.''If amniocentesis is performed to determine fetal lung maturity, it is often done anywhere between the 32nd and 36th week of pregnancy. In women with ''diabetes'', lung maturity testing may be done as late as the 39th week, because poorly controlled ''diabetes'' may delay fetal lung maturity.' "
Is amniocentesis safe?,"'Overall, amniocentesis is a safe procedure with the risk of fetal loss generally less than 1%. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin, there is a procedure-related rate of fetal loss ranging from 1/300 to 1/500 procedures.''Because there is still a slight possibility of pregnancy loss from the procedure, amniocentesis should be performed only when clearly indicated and its benefits have been determined to outweigh any associated risks. Many parents ask for the procedure to ""reassure"" themselves that everything is perfect. It should be emphasized that an amniocentesis with normal results does not guarantee that the baby will not have a birth or genetic defect. Many birth defects cannot be detected by amniocentesis. Besides fetal loss, other risks associated with amniocentesis include bleeding, cramping and leakage of fluid from the amniotic sac. These problems occur in about 1% of women undergoing the procedure, and they generally resolve on their own. If these symptoms arise following the procedure, the woman is often advised to stop work and remain at bed rest until the symptoms cease. Subsequently activity may be restricted by the doctor. Occasionally, the needle enters the fetus during an amniocentesis. This is generally harmless, but the infant should be monitored for a short time following the testing.''Amniocentesis is a relatively safe and painless procedure that can provide helpful information. The procedure can be offered to selected women after reviewing the anticipated risks and benefits involved.' "

What is amebiasis?,"'Amebiasis is a parasitic disease (also known as amebic dysentery or amoebic dysentery and/or amoebiasis) caused by infection with ''Entamoeba histolytica'' or another amoeba (for example, ''E. dispar''). Most individuals with the disease may have no symptoms. ''E. histolytica'' is the species that produces symptoms only in about 10% of those infected. The single or one-celled, flash-shaped or shifting shaped organism usually produces dysentery and occasionally invasive extra intestinal problems (invasive amebiasis), the most common of which are ''liver'' abscesses, although other organs can be involved. The disease is most common in people who live in tropical areas with poor sanitary conditions. It is estimated that amebiasis causes 50,000-100,000 deaths worldwide each year.' "
What causes amebiasis?,"'The cause of amebiasis is infection by the protozoan parasite ''Entamoeba histolytica''. It begins when a person ''drinks'' contaminated water or eats foods contaminated with the cystic form (infective stage), comes in contact with contaminated colonic irrigation devices or the fecally contaminated hands of food handlers, or by oral-anal sexual practices.''The cystic form changes into trophozoites (invasive form) in the ilium or colon and invade the mucosal barrier, leading to tissue destruction and ''diarrhea''. These trophozoites can reach the portal blood circulation to the ''liver'' and eventually go to other organs. It only infects humans, and the CDC does not classify it as a free-living organism.' "
What are risk factors for amebiasis?,"'Risk factors include' drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated foods, association with food handlers whose hands are contaminated, anal sexual practices, contaminated medical devices such as colonic irrigation devices, malnourishment, recipients of corticosteroids, pregnancy, very young patients, and travelers to endemic areas such as Southeast Asia or Central America."
What is the incubation period for amebiasis?,"'The incubation period for amebiasis is variable. Symptoms begin to appear in about one to four weeks after ingestion of the ''cysts''; however, the range may be from a few days to years.' "
"Is amebiasis contagious? If so, what is the contagious period for amebiasis?","'Yes, amebiasis is contagious person to person. It is spread by the fecal-oral route by an infected person. The contagious period lasts as long as the infected patient excretes cysts in their stools. Consequently, the contagious period may last for weeks to many years if untreated.' "
What are amebiasis symptoms and signs?,"'Although only about 10%-20% of people infected with the parasites become ill, those individuals may produce the following symptoms and signs:'   Early symptoms (in about 1-4 weeks) include loose stools and mild abdominal cramping If the disease progresses, frequent, watery, and/or bloody stools with severe abdominal cramping (termed amoebic dysentery) may occur. If the trophozoites reach the intestinal walls and go through them, symptoms of liver infection such as liver tenderness and fever are the initial signs and symptoms of liver abscess formation (hepatic amebiasis). Other organs (heart, lungs, brain [meningoencephalitis], for example) may produce symptoms specific to the organ and produce severe illness and/or death. Abdominal tenderness and/or stomach pain Tenesmus Flatulence Appetite loss Weight loss Fatigue Anemia Occasionally cause skin lesions (cutaneous amebiasis)"
What specialists treat amebiasis?,"'In addition to your primary care physician, the following specialists may be consulted:' Gastroenterologist Infectious disease specialist General surgeon (especially if the patient develops severe disease like fulminant colitis) Occasionally, dermatologist"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose amebiasis?,"'If your recent health history and travel history suggests a possibility of amebiasis, your doctor may ask you to provide several ''stool'' samples to screen for the presence of ''E. histolytica'' cysts in your stools. In addition, some routine blood tests as well as other tests to determine if parasites spread to other organs may be initiated for laboratory diagnosis. These tests may include the following:' Liver function tests Serological tests Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Ultrasound of the liver CT scan of the liver and perhaps other organs Colonoscopy of the large intestine to search for parasites Your doctor may run other serological tests to rule out other infectious diseases like giardiasis, paragonimiasis, and arboviral brain infections, for example."
What are medical treatment options for amebiasis?,"'Asymptomatic infections are not treated unless they are occurring in non-endemic areas. If patients are shedding ''E. histolytica'' cysts, the following luminal agents (''drugs'' that work on cysts that are not invading the gastrointestinal epithelium) are as follows:''To treat invasive amebiasis, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'', ''MetroGel'', ''Noritate'') is recommended even for amoebic liver abscesses (up to 10 cm sized abscesses). Tinidazole (Tindamax) is FDA approved for treatment of both intestinal or extraintestinal (invasive) amebiasis. Other countries have similar ''drugs'' for treatments, but they are not available in the United States.''Amoebic ''colitis'' can be treated with nitroimidazoles, but they should be followed up by a luminal agent.''Treatment of hepatic amebiasis has been successful in some patients with ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or dehydroemetine (which is only available from the CDC and is not a preferred treatment because of potential heart toxicity).''If the gastrointestinal tract is suspected to be perforated (perforation can occur with fulminant amoebic colitis), broad-spectrum antibiotics may be used to prevent ''peritonitis''.'  Paromomycin (Humatin) Iodoquinol (Yodoxin) Diloxanide furoate"
What are surgical treatment options for amebiasis?,'Surgical treatments are required or indicated for amebiasis treatment due to the following:' Gastrointestinal bleeding (massive or uncontrolled) Perforated amoebic colitis Toxic megacolon Failure to respond to metronidazole after four days of treatment Amoebic liver abscesses greater than 10 cm in size Empyema after the liver abscess rupture Amoebic liver abscess representing risk of rupture to the pericardium Impending abscess rupture (no medical response in about 3-5 days to expanding abscess) Percutaneous drainage by catheter can be lifesaving in patients with amoebic pericarditis
Are there home remedies for amebiasis?,"'There are many home remedies for amebiasis available on the Internet. They range from increased fluid intake, coconut water, buttermilk, black tea, and herbal tea to ''garlic'', Indian lilac, oregano, and apple cider vinegar. If you think you have amebiasis, you should discuss your symptoms with a doctor before trying any self-treatment remedies.' "
What are complications of amebiasis?,"'Although infrequent, there can be serious complications of the disease. They include' liver abscesses (it is possible to develop these abscesses without the typical diarrhea stage), lung abscesses, brain abscesses, ameboma (a large local lesion of the bowel caused by the response to the infecting parasite), fulminant or necrotizing colitis, rectal rational fistula, bloody dysentery, toxic megacolon, increased risk for cancer, and death."
Is it possible to prevent amebiasis?,"'Yes, amebiasis can be prevented by stopping the fecal contamination of food and water by the Centers for Disease Control personnel by correcting poor sanitation. Identification and treatment of food handlers or other carriers of the parasite can reduce the chance of getting food-borne amebiasis. Avoiding sexual practices that involve fecal-oral contact also may reduce the chance of getting the disease. Avoiding malnutrition and ''alcohol'' use can reduce risk of the disease.'""Gal-lectin, an antigen from the parasite, has been used as a vaccine to protect animals against intestinal amebiasis and against amoebic liver abscesses. Other parasitic components are being tried as possible vaccine components to use in humans. Unfortunately, amebiasis doesn't result in any long-term immunity so that individuals can be reinfected multiple times."" "
What is the prognosis of amebiasis? What is the recovery time for amebiasis?,"'In general, the prognosis of amebiasis is good since the vast majority of infected individuals showed little or no symptoms. However, if complications develop such as abscesses, ''peritonitis'', or toxic megacolon, the prognosis may vary from fair to poor depending on the availability of medical support services.''Recovery time for amebiasis is related to the severity of the disease. If a person has no symptoms, there is no recovery time. Recovery time after medical treatment varies from about 1-2 weeks to as many as four weeks or more after surgery. You and your doctor need to discuss your estimated recovery time once treatment begins.' "
What is amyloidosis?,"'Amyloidosis is a group of diseases that are a consequence of abnormal protein deposits in various tissues of the body. These abnormal proteins are called amyloid. Depending on the structure of the particular amyloid, the protein can accumulate in an isolated tissue or be widespread, affecting numerous organs and tissues. There are over 30 different amyloid proteins. Each amyloid protein is arranged in a structure called a fibril. Fibrils are low molecular weight proteins that are derived from precursor proteins. Fibrils of amyloid can float in the plasma of blood and deposit into tissues of the body.''Amyloid protein can be deposited in a localized area and may not be harmful or only affect a single tissue of the body impairing its function. This form of amyloidosis is called localized amyloidosis. Amyloidosis that affects many tissues throughout the body is referred to as systemic amyloidosis. The systemic form can cause serious changes in virtually any organ of the body, including the kidneys (renal amyloidosis), ''heart'' (cardiac amyloidosis), skin (cutaneous amyloidosis), and ''lungs'' (pulmonary amyloidosis).''Systemic amyloidosis has been classified into three major types that are very different from each other. These are distinguished by a two-letter code that begins with an A (for amyloid). The second letter of the code stands for the protein that accumulates in the tissues in that particular type of amyloidosis. The major types of systemic amyloidosis are currently categorized as primary (now AL), secondary (AA), and hereditary (ATTR, amyloid apolipoprotein A1 or AApoAI, amyloid apolipoprotein A2 or AApoAII, AGel, ALys, ''AFib'').''Amyloidosis that occurs as its own entity has been called primary amyloidosis. It is currently referred to as AL amyloidosis to signify that immunoglobulin light-chain proteins are produced as a result. Secondary amyloidosis is amyloidosis that occurs as a byproduct of another illness, including chronic infections (such as ''tuberculosis'' or ''osteomyelitis''), or chronic inflammatory diseases (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''inflammatory bowel disease''). Other forms of amyloidosis include beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis from chronic ''kidney dialysis'' and localized amyloidosies. Amyloidosis that is localized to a specific body area from ''aging'' does not have systemic implications for the rest of the body. The protein that deposits in the brain of patients with '""Alzheimer's""' disease is a form of amyloid.''Immunoglobulin light chain or AL amyloidosis (formerly primary amyloidosis), occurs when a specialized cell in the bone marrow (plasma cell) spontaneously overproduces a particular protein portion of an antibody called the light chain. (This is why the primary form is now referred to as AL.) The deposits in the tissues of people with primary amyloidosis are AL proteins. It can affect the heart, kidney, ''liver'', and skin. This is the most common type of amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis can occur with a bone marrow ''cancer'' of plasma cells called ''multiple myeloma'' (fewer than 20% of AL patients). AL amyloidosis, including multiple ''myeloma'' ''cancer'', is not associated with any other diseases but is a disease entity of its own, conventionally requiring ''chemotherapy'"" treatment. Researchers have demonstrated the benefits of stem-cell transplantation therapy for AL amyloidosis. In stem-cell transplantation, doctors harvest the patients' own ""'stem cells'' and store them while the patient receives therapy and then uses them to treat AL amyloidosis by replacing the abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow.''When amyloidosis occurs secondarily as a result of another illness, such as chronic infections (for example, ''tuberculosis'' or osteomyelitis) or chronic inflammatory diseases (for example, ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''ankylosing spondylitis'""), the condition is referred to as secondary amyloidosis or AA amyloidosis. The amyloid tissue deposits in secondary amyloidosis are AA proteins. The treatment of patients' AA amyloidosis is directed at treating the underlying illness in that particular patient.""'Familial amyloidosis (ATTR, AApoAI, AApoAII, AGel, ALys, AFib) is a rare form of inherited amyloidosis. It is more common in patients of African descent. The amyloid deposits in most familial amyloidosis are composed of the protein transthyretin, or TTR, which is made in the liver. Familial amyloidosis is sometimes referred to as hereditary transthyretin-mediated or HTTR amyloidosis. Familial amyloidosis is an inherited autosomal dominant in genetics terminology. This means that for the offspring of a person with the condition, there is a 50% chance of inheriting it. This form of amyloidosis is also referred to as hereditary amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis can affect the nerves and the heart.''Beta-2 microglobulin amyloidosis occurs when amyloid deposits develop in patients on ''dialysis'' with longstanding ''kidney failure''. The amyloid deposits are composed of beta-2 microglobulin protein and are often found around joints.''The many forms of localized amyloidosis are a result of amyloid deposits in specific areas of the body and are distinct from systemic forms of amyloidosis that deposit amyloid throughout the body. Localized amyloid deposits occur in the brain from '""Alzheimer's""' disease. In various tissues, often with ''aging'' (senile amyloidosis), amyloid can be locally produced and deposited to cause tissue injury. Prions are infectious amyloid proteins that transmit the diseases kuru, ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'', fatal familial ''insomnia'', and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome.' "
What causes amyloidosis?,"'Amyloidosis is caused by changes in proteins that make them insoluble, leading them to deposit in organs and tissues. These amyloid proteins accumulate mainly in the tissue space between cells. Changes in proteins that make them amyloid proteins occur because of gene mutations in DNA within cells.' "
What are risk factors for amyloidosis?,"'Risk factors for the inherited forms of amyloidosis are being genetically related to an ancestor with the disease. The risk factors for secondary amyloidosis are the underlying inflammatory chronic medical conditions.''Age is a risk factor for amyloidosis, as well, as most people who develop amyloidosis are over 60 years old.''Male gender is a risk factor for amyloidosis as about 70% of people with AL are male.' "
What are amyloidosis symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms in patients with amyloidosis result from abnormal functioning of the particular organs involved. There might be no symptoms until the disease is relatively advanced. The heart, kidneys, liver, bowels, skin, nerves, joints, and lungs can be affected. As a result, symptoms and signs are vague and can include ''fatigue'', ''shortness of breath'', ''weight loss'', ''lack of appetite'', numbness, tingling, ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', ''weakness'', ''hearing loss'', enlarged tongue, ''bruising'', and swelling of hands and ''feet''. Amyloidosis in these organs leads to ''cardiomyopathy'', ''heart failure'', ''peripheral neuropathy'', ''arthritis'', malabsorption, ''diarrhea'', and liver damage and failure. Amyloidosis affecting the kidney leads to ""nephrotic syndrome,"" which is characterized by severe loss of ''protein in the urine'' and swelling of the extremities.'  "
What health care specialists treat amyloidosis?,"'Amyloidosis can affect many different body systems and organs. Therefore, many different health specialists might be involved in the care.''Health care professionals who can be involved in the care of patients with amyloidosis include hematologists, nephrologists, cardiologists, ''rheumatologists'', pulmonologists, neurologists, pathologists, and internists.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose amyloidosis?,"'Blood tests and urine tests can be used to look for abnormal proteins (light chain proteins) that could indicate amyloidosis.''The definite diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by detecting the characteristic amyloid protein in a biopsy specimen of involved tissue (such as mouth, rectum, fat, kidney, heart, or liver). A needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration), originally developed at Boston University, offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis. Pathologists (physician specializing in examining tissues) can see the protein in the biopsy specimen when it is coated with a special dye, called Congo red stain.''Once the diagnosis is made, tests of the involved organs can help establish the extent of the disease.' "
What is the treatment for amyloidosis?,"'There is no cure for amyloidosis. The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the type of amyloidosis involved. Initial treatment of amyloidosis involves correcting organ failure and treating any underlying illness (such as myeloma, infection, or inflammation). The disease is frequently discovered after significant organ damage has already occurred. Therefore, stabilization of organ function is an initial target of treatment. The most frequent cause of death in systemic amyloidosis is ''kidney failure''.''Treatment depends on the overall health of the patient and options include chemotherapy agents usually used for certain ''cancers'' and ''dexamethasone'' for its anti-inflammatory actions.''Sephardic Jews and Turks inherit a ''genetic disease'' called familial Mediterranean ''fever'', which is associated with amyloidosis and characterized by episodes of ""attacks"" of ''fever'', joint, and ''abdominal pains''. These attacks can be prevented with the medication ''colchicine'' (''Colcrys''). Armenians and Ashkenazi Jews also have a higher incidence of familial Mediterranean fever attacks but do not suffer amyloid deposition disease.''Doctors can treat patients with AL amyloidosis (previously referred to as primary amyloidosis) who have reasonable underlying health with a ''cancer'' chemotherapy medication (''melphalan'' [''Alkeran'']) in conjunction with bone-marrow stem-cell transplantation. These treatments attack the abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow that are causing the AL amyloidosis. The results have been promising, and this combination treatment is offered to eradicate the amyloidosis in selected patients, provided that the underlying medical condition of the patient is adequate. These aggressive treatment options with stem-cell transplantation and high doses of chemotherapy are a true breakthrough in the treatment of patients with this form of amyloidosis. Other treatments include bortezomib (''Velcade''), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), and dexamethasone. For patients whose disease relapses or does not respond to initial treatments, ''clinical trials'' are available using ixazomib (Ninlaro) and monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab (Darzalex) used in multiple myeloma treatment. Other treatments include ''lenalidomide'', pomalidomide, ''thalidomide'', and dexamethasone. ''Familial ATTR amyloidosis can now be cured with liver transplantation. This treatment option requires an accurate diagnosis of the specific protein that causes the disease.''Renal amyloidosis can be treated by kidney transplantation (renal transplantation).'  "
What are complications of amyloidosis?,"'Complications of amyloidosis are a function of what organs and tissues are affected and to what degree their function is impaired. Amyloidosis can lead to failure of lung, liver, heart, nerves, and kidney function. Additionally, the treatments (including chemotherapy as well as stem-cell and organ transplantation) can have serious side effects.'  "
What is the prognosis of amyloidosis? What is the life expectancy for patients with amyloidosis?,"'The outlook depends on the form of amyloidosis and its response to treatment. Systemic amyloidosis is slowly progressive and fatal if untreated. The average survival for AL amyloidosis is now years but significantly depends on what organs are affected. When the heart is involved, the survival decreases.  Familial amyloidosis can survive well into the second decade. Again, the outlook and life expectancy is adversely affected by vital organ involvement.' "
Is it possible to prevent amyloidosis?,"'There is no ''prevention'' for amyloidosis. However, the secondary forms of amyloidosis can be prevented by treating the underlying diseases that are associated with inflammation. ''Genetic counseling'' can be beneficial in familial amyloidosis.' "
Where can people find more information on amyloidosis?,"'For more information about amyloidosis, please visit the following site:''Boston Medical Center''http://www.bu.edu/amyloid/''There are also clinical trials available for treating amyloidosis and major medical centers throughout the U.S.' "
What is amyloidosis?,"'Amyloidosis is a group of diseases that are a consequence of abnormal protein deposits in various tissues of the body. These abnormal proteins are called amyloid. Depending on the structure of the particular amyloid, the protein can accumulate in an isolated tissue or be widespread, affecting numerous organs and tissues. There are over 30 different amyloid proteins. Each amyloid protein is arranged in a structure called a fibril. Fibrils are low molecular weight proteins that are derived from precursor proteins. Fibrils of amyloid can float in the plasma of blood and deposit into tissues of the body.''Amyloid protein can be deposited in a localized area and may not be harmful or only affect a single tissue of the body impairing its function. This form of amyloidosis is called localized amyloidosis. Amyloidosis that affects many tissues throughout the body is referred to as systemic amyloidosis. The systemic form can cause serious changes in virtually any organ of the body, including the kidneys (renal amyloidosis), ''heart'' (cardiac amyloidosis), skin (cutaneous amyloidosis), and ''lungs'' (pulmonary amyloidosis).''Systemic amyloidosis has been classified into three major types that are very different from each other. These are distinguished by a two-letter code that begins with an A (for amyloid). The second letter of the code stands for the protein that accumulates in the tissues in that particular type of amyloidosis. The major types of systemic amyloidosis are currently categorized as primary (now AL), secondary (AA), and hereditary (ATTR, amyloid apolipoprotein A1 or AApoAI, amyloid apolipoprotein A2 or AApoAII, AGel, ALys, ''AFib'').''Amyloidosis that occurs as its own entity has been called primary amyloidosis.

What is ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)?,"'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare group of neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, ''walking'', ''breathing'' and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.''ALS belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells that extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. These motor neurons initiate and provide vital communication links between the brain and the voluntary muscles.''Messages from motor neurons in the brain (called upper motor neurons) are transmitted to motor neurons in the spinal cord and to motor nuclei of brain (called lower motor neurons) and from the spinal cord and motor nuclei of brain to a particular muscle or muscles.''In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die, and stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, start to twitch (called fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements.''Early symptoms of ALS usually include muscle weakness or stiffness. Gradually all muscles under voluntary control are affected, and individuals lose their strength and the ability to speak, eat, move, and even breathe.''Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS survive for 10 or more years.'  "
What are the early symptoms of ALS?,"'The onset of ALS can be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked but gradually these symptoms develop into more obvious weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to suspect ALS. Some of the early symptoms include:''When symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as “limb onset” ALS. Other individuals first notice speech or ''swallowing problems'', termed “bulbar onset” ALS.'   fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue muscle cramps tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) muscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, neck or diaphragm. slurred and nasal speech difficulty chewing or swallowing. For many individuals the first sign of ALS may appear in the hand or arm as they experience difficulty with simple tasks such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. In other cases, symptoms initially affect one of the legs, and people experience awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often."
What are the later symptoms of ALS?,"'Regardless of where the symptoms first appear, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals may develop problems with moving, swallowing (''dysphagia''), speaking or forming words (''dysarthria''), and breathing (dyspnea).''Although the sequence of emerging symptoms and the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms.''Individuals with ALS usually have ''difficulty swallowing'' and chewing food, which makes it hard to eat normally and increases the risk of choking. They also ''burn'' calories at a faster rate than most people without ALS. Due to these factors, people with ALS tend to ''lose weight'' rapidly and can become malnourished.''Because people with ALS usually retain their ability to perform higher mental processes such as reasoning, remembering, understanding, and problem solving, they are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and ''depressed''.''A small percentage of individuals may experience problems with language or decision-making, and there is growing evidence that some may even develop a form of ''dementia'' over time.''Individuals with ALS will have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. They eventually lose the ability to breathe on their own and must depend on a ventilator. Affected individuals also face an increased risk of ''pneumonia'' during later stages of the disease. Besides ''muscle cramps'' that may cause discomfort, some individuals with ALS may develop painful neuropathy (nerve disease or damage).' "
How common is ALS? Who gets the disease?,"'In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' estimated that between 14,000 - 15,000 Americans have ALS. ALS is a common neuromuscular disease worldwide. It affects people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.''There are several potential risk factors for ALS including:''The majority of ALS cases (90 percent or more) are considered sporadic. This means the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease. Although family members of people with sporadic ALS are at an increased risk for the disease, the overall risk is very low and most will not develop ALS.''About 5 to 10 percent of all ALS cases are familial, which means that an individual inherits the disease from his or her parents. The familial form of ALS usually only requires one parent to carry the gene responsible for the disease. Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. About 25 to 40 percent of all familial cases (and a small percentage of sporadic cases) are caused by a defect in a gene known as “chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,” or C9ORF72. Interestingly, the same mutation can be associated with atrophy of frontal-temporal lobes of the brain causing frontal-temporal lobe ''dementia''. Some individuals carrying this mutation may show signs of both motor neuron and ''dementia'' symptoms (ALS-FTD). Another 12 to 20 percent of familial cases result from mutations in the gene that provides instructions for the production of the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).' Age. Although the disease can strike at any age, symptoms most commonly develop between the ages of 55 and 75. Gender. Men are slightly more likely than women to develop ALS. However, as age the difference between men and women disappears. Race and ethnicity. Most likely to develop the disease are Caucasians and non-Hispanics. Some studies suggest that military veterans are about 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ALS. Although the reason for this is unclear, possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. ALS is recognized as a service-connected disease by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."
What causes ALS? Is it inherited?,"'The cause of ALS is not known, and scientists do not yet know why ALS strikes some people and not others. However, evidence from scientific studies suggests that both genetics and environment play a role in the development of ALS.''An important step toward determining ALS risk factors was made in 1993 when scientists supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) discovered that mutations in the SOD1 gene were associated with some cases of familial ALS. Although it is still not clear how mutations in the SOD1 gene lead to motor neuron degeneration, there is increasing evidence that the gene playing a role in producing mutant SOD1 protein can become toxic.''Since then, more than a dozen additional genetic mutations have been identified, many through NINDS-supported research, and each of these gene discoveries is providing new insights into possible mechanisms of ALS.''The discovery of certain genetic mutations involved in ALS suggests that changes in the processing of RNA molecules may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration. RNA molecules are one of the major macromolecules in the cell involved in directing the synthesis of specific proteins as well as gene regulation and activity.''Other gene mutations indicate defects in the natural process in which malfunctioning proteins are broken down and used to build new ones, known as protein recycling. Still others point to possible defects in the structure and shape of motor neurons, as well as increased susceptibility to environmental toxins. Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cellular defects can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.''In 2011 another important discovery was made when scientists found that a defect in the C9ORF72 gene is not only present in a significant subset of individuals with ALS but also in some people with a type of ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD). This observation provides evidence for genetic ties between these two neurodegenerative disorders. Most researchers now believe ALS and some forms of FTD are related disorders.''In searching for the cause of ALS, researchers are also studying the impact of environmental factors. Researchers are investigating a number of possible causes such as exposure to toxic or infectious agents, ''viruses'', physical ''trauma'', ''diet'', and behavioral and occupational factors.''For example, researchers have suggested that exposure to toxins during warfare, or strenuous physical activity, are possible reasons for why some veterans and athletes may be at increased risk of developing ALS.''Although there has been no consistent association between any environmental factor and the risk of developing ALS, future research may show that some factors are involved in the development or progression of the disease.' "
Is there a test for ALS?,"'No one test can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS. ALS is primarily diagnosed based on detailed history of the symptoms and signs observed by a physician during physical examination along with a series of tests to rule out other mimicking diseases. However, the presence of upper and lower motor neuron symptoms strongly suggests the presence of the disease.''Physicians will review an individual’s full medical history and conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, and spasticity are getting progressively worse.''ALS symptoms in the early stages of the disease can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders. Appropriate tests can exclude the possibility of other conditions.''Electromyography (''EMG''), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity of muscle fibers, can help diagnose ALS. Another common test is a nerve conduction study (NCS), which measures electrical activity of the nerves and muscles by assessing the nerve’s ability to send a signal along the nerve or to the muscle. Specific abnormalities in the NCS and EMG may suggest, for example, that the individual has a form of ''peripheral neuropathy'' (damage to peripheral nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS.''A physician may also order a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') test, a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Standard MRI scans are generally normal in people with ALS. However, they can reveal other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord ''tumor'', a ''herniated disk'' in the neck that compresses the spinal cord, syringomyelia (a ''cyst'' in the spinal cord), or cervical spondylosis (abnormal wear affecting the spine in the neck).''Based on the person’s symptoms, test results, and findings from the examination, a physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases.''Infectious diseases such as ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), human T-cell ''leukemia'' virus (HTLV), ''polio'', and ''West Nile virus'' can, in some cases, cause ALS-like symptoms. Neurological disorders such as ''multiple sclerosis'', ''post-polio syndrome'', multifocal motor neuropathy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy’s disease) also can mimic certain features of the disease and should be considered by physicians attempting to make a diagnosis. Fasciculations and muscle ''cramps'' also occur in benign conditions.''Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early stages of the disease, individuals may wish to obtain a second neurological opinion.' "
What is the treatment for the symtptoms of ALS? Is there cure?,"'No cure has yet been found for ALS. However, there are treatments available that can help control symptoms, prevent unnecessary complications, and make living with the disease easier.''Supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; respiratory therapists and clinical psychologists; and home care and ''hospice'' nurses. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ''drugs'' riluzole (Rilutek) and edaravone (Radicava) to treat ALS. Riluzole is believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing levels of glutamate, which transports messages between nerve cells and motor neurons. Clinical trials in people with ALS showed that riluzole prolongs survival by a few months, particularly in the bulbar form of the disease, but does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons. Edaravone has been shown to slow the decline in clinical assessment of daily functioning in persons with ALS.''Physicians can also prescribe medications to help manage symptoms of ALS, including muscle cramps, stiffness, excess saliva and ''phlegm'', and the pseudobulbar affect (involuntary or uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays). Drugs also are available to help individuals with ''pain'', ''depression'', ''sleep'' disturbances, and ''constipation''. Pharmacists can give advice on the proper use of medications and monitor a person’s prescriptions to avoid risks of ''drug interactions''.''Physical therapy and special equipment can enhance an individual’s independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact ''aerobic exercise'' such as walking, ''swimming'', and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help people fight ''fatigue'' and ''depression''. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles.''Physical therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles. Occupational therapists can suggest devices such as ramps, ''braces'', walkers, and wheelchairs that help individuals conserve energy and remain mobile.''People with ALS who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a speech therapist, who can teach adaptive strategies to speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech therapists can help people maintain the ability to communicate. They can recommend aids such as computer-based speech synthesizers that use eye-tracking technology and can help people develop ways for responding to yes-or-no questions with their eyes or by other nonverbal means.''Some people with ALS may choose to use voice banking while they are still able to speak as a process of storing their own voice for future use in computer-based speech synthesizers. These methods and devices help people communicate when they can no longer speak or produce vocal sounds.''Nutritional support is an important part of the care of people with ALS. It has been shown that individuals with ALS will get weaker if they lose weight. Nutritionists can teach individuals and caregivers how to plan and prepare small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, ''fiber'', and fluid and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. People may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent choking. When individuals can no longer get enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach. The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and ''pneumonia'' that can result from inhaling liquids into the ''lungs''.''As the muscles responsible for breathing start to weaken, people may experience ''shortness of breath'' during physical activity and difficulty breathing at night or when lying down. Doctors may test an individual’s breathing to determine when to recommend a treatment called noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV refers to breathing support that is usually delivered through a mask over the nose and/or mouth. Initially, NIV may only be necessary at night. When muscles are no longer able to maintain normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, NIV may be used full-time. NIV improves the quality of life and prolongs survival for many people with ALS.''Because the muscles that control breathing become weak, individuals with ALS may also have trouble generating a strong ''cough''. There are several techniques to help people increase forceful ''coughing'', including mechanical ''cough'' assist devices and breath stacking. In breath stacking, a person takes a series of small breaths without exhaling until the lungs are full, briefly holds the breath, and then expels the air with a cough.''As the disease progresses and muscles weaken further, individuals may consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. Doctors may place a ''breathing tube'' through the mouth or may surgically create a hole at the front of the neck and insert a tube leading to the windpipe (''tracheostomy''). The tube is connected to a respirator.''Individuals with ALS and their families often consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use ventilation support. These devices differ in their effect on a person’s quality of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. People may choose to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support.'  "
Are there new treatment options for ALS? What research is being done to find a cure?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world.''The goals of NINDS research on ALS are to understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the disease, investigate the influence of genetics and other potential risk factors, identify biomarkers, and develop new and more effective treatments.''Scientists are seeking to understand the mechanisms that selectively trigger motor neurons to degenerate in ALS, and to find effective approaches to halt the processes leading to cell death. Using both animal models and cell culture systems, scientists are trying to determine how and why ALS-causing gene mutations lead to the destruction of neurons. These animal models include fruit flies, zebrafish, and rodents.''Initially, genetically modified animal models focused on mutations in the SOD1 gene but more recently, models have been developed for defects in the C9ORF72, TARDP, FUS, PFN1, TUBA4A, and UBQLN2 genes. Research in these models suggests that, depending on the gene mutation, motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects, including in the processing of RNA molecules and recycling of proteins, and structural impairments of motor neurons. Increasing evidence also suggests that various types of glial support cells and inflammation cells of the nervous system may play an important role in the disease.''In addition to animal models, scientists are also using innovative ''stem cells'' models to study ALS. Scientists have developed ways to take skin or blood cells from individuals with ALS and turn them into stem cells, which are capable of becoming any cell type in the body, including motor neurons and other cell types that may be involved in the disease. NINDS is supporting research on the development of stem cell lines for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.''Overall, the work in familial ALS is already leading to a greater understanding of the more common sporadic form of the disease. Because familial ALS and sporadic ALS show many of the same signs and symptoms, some researchers believe that some familial ALS genes may also be involved in sporadic ALS.''Clinical research studies supported by NINDS are looking into how ALS symptoms change over time in people with C9ORF72 mutations. Other NINDS-supported research studies are working to identify additional genes that may cause or put a person at risk for either familial or sporadic ALS.''Additionally, researchers are looking at the potential role of epigenetics in the development of ALS. Epigenetic changes can switch genes on and off, and thus can profoundly affect the human condition in both health and disease. These changes can occur in response to multiple factors, including external or environmental conditions and events. Although this research is still at a very exploratory stage, scientists hope that understanding epigenetics can offer new information about how ALS develops.''Biomarkers are biological measures that help to identify the presence or rate of progression of a disease or the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention. Since ALS is difficult to diagnose, biomarkers could potentially help clinicians diagnose ALS earlier and faster.''Additionally, biomarkers are needed to help predict and accurately measure disease progression and enhance clinical studies aimed at developing more effective treatments. Biomarkers can be molecules derived from a bodily fluid (such as those in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid), an image of the brain or spinal cord, or a measure of the ability of a nerve or muscle to process electrical signals. The NINDS is supporting research on the development biomarkers for ALS.''Potential therapies for ALS are being investigated in a range of disease models. This work involves tests of drug-like compounds, gene therapy approaches, antibodies, and cell-based therapies. For example, NINDS-supported scientists are currently investigating whether lowering levels of the SOD1 enzyme in the brain and spinal cord of individuals with SOD1 gene mutations would slow the rate of disease progression.''Other NINDS scientists are studying the use of glial-restricted progenitor cells (which have the ability to develop into other support cells) to slow disease progression and improve respiratory function. Additionally, a number of exploratory treatments are being tested in people with ALS. Investigators are optimistic that these and other basic, translational, and clinical research studies will eventually lead to new and more effective treatments for ALS.''More information about ALS research supported by NINDS and other NIH Institutes and Centers can be found using NIH RePORTER (projectreporter.nih.gov), a searchable database of current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal agencies.

What is the ALS National Registry? Where can I find clinical trials on ALS?,"'The National ALS Registry is a program to collect, manage, and analyze data about people with ALS in the United States. Developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), this registry establishes information about the number of ALS cases, collects demographic, occupational and environmental exposure data from people with ALS to learn about potential risk factors for the disease, and notifies participants about research opportunities. The Registry includes data from national databases as well as de-identified information provided by individuals with ALS. All information is kept confidential. People with ALS can add their information to the Registry by visiting www.cdc.gov/als.''Many neurological disorders do not have effective treatment options.

Tissue from individuals with ALS is needed to enable scientists to study this disorder more intensely. The goal is to increase the availability of, and access to, high quality specimens for research to understand the neurological basis of the disease. Prospective donors can begin the enrollment process by visiting www.neurobiobank.nih.gov/pages/donor.' "
What is ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)?,"'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare group of neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, ''walking'', ''breathing'' and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.''ALS belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells that extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. These motor neurons initiate and provide vital communication links between the brain and the voluntary muscles.''Messages from motor neurons in the brain (called upper motor neurons) are transmitted to motor neurons in the spinal cord and to motor nuclei of brain (called lower motor neurons) and from the spinal cord and motor nuclei of brain to a particular muscle or muscles.''In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die, and stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, start to twitch (called fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements.''Early symptoms of ALS usually include muscle weakness or stiffness. Gradually all muscles under voluntary control are affected, and individuals lose their strength and the ability to speak, eat, move, and even breathe.''Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS survive for 10 or more years.'  "
What are the early symptoms of ALS?,"'The onset of ALS can be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked but gradually these symptoms develop into more obvious weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to suspect ALS. Some of the early symptoms include:''When symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as “limb onset” ALS. Other individuals first notice speech or ''swallowing problems'', termed “bulbar onset” ALS.'   fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue muscle cramps tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) muscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, neck or diaphragm. slurred and nasal speech difficulty chewing or swallowing. For many individuals the first sign of ALS may appear in the hand or arm as they experience difficulty with simple tasks such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. In other cases, symptoms initially affect one of the legs, and people experience awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often."
What are the later symptoms of ALS?,"'Regardless of where the symptoms first appear, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals may develop problems with moving, swallowing (''dysphagia''), speaking or forming words (''dysarthria''), and breathing (dyspnea).''Although the sequence of emerging symptoms and the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms.''Individuals with ALS usually have ''difficulty swallowing'' and chewing food, which makes it hard to eat normally and increases the risk of choking. They also ''burn'' calories at a faster rate than most people without ALS. Due to these factors, people with ALS tend to ''lose weight'' rapidly and can become malnourished.''Because people with ALS usually retain their ability to perform higher mental processes such as reasoning, remembering, understanding, and problem solving, they are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and ''depressed''.''A small percentage of individuals may experience problems with language or decision-making, and there is growing evidence that some may even develop a form of ''dementia'' over time.''Individuals with ALS will have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. They eventually lose the ability to breathe on their own and must depend on a ventilator. Affected individuals also face an increased risk of ''pneumonia'' during later stages of the disease. Besides ''muscle cramps'' that may cause discomfort, some individuals with ALS may develop painful neuropathy (nerve disease or damage).' "
How common is ALS? Who gets the disease?,"'In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' estimated that between 14,000 - 15,000 Americans have ALS. ALS is a common neuromuscular disease worldwide. It affects people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.''There are several potential risk factors for ALS including:''The majority of ALS cases (90 percent or more) are considered sporadic. This means the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease. Although family members of people with sporadic ALS are at an increased risk for the disease, the overall risk is very low and most will not develop ALS.''About 5 to 10 percent of all ALS cases are familial, which means that an individual inherits the disease from his or her parents. The familial form of ALS usually only requires one parent to carry the gene responsible for the disease. Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. About 25 to 40 percent of all familial cases (and a small percentage of sporadic cases) are caused by a defect in a gene known as “chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,” or C9ORF72. Interestingly, the same mutation can be associated with atrophy of frontal-temporal lobes of the brain causing frontal-temporal lobe ''dementia''. Some individuals carrying this mutation may show signs of both motor neuron and ''dementia'' symptoms (ALS-FTD). Another 12 to 20 percent of familial cases result from mutations in the gene that provides instructions for the production of the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).' Age. Although the disease can strike at any age, symptoms most commonly develop between the ages of 55 and 75. Gender. Men are slightly more likely than women to develop ALS. However, as age the difference between men and women disappears. Race and ethnicity. Most likely to develop the disease are Caucasians and non-Hispanics. Some studies suggest that military veterans are about 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ALS. Although the reason for this is unclear, possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. ALS is recognized as a service-connected disease by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."
What causes ALS? Is it inherited?,"'The cause of ALS is not known, and scientists do not yet know why ALS strikes some people and not others. However, evidence from scientific studies suggests that both genetics and environment play a role in the development of ALS.''An important step toward determining ALS risk factors was made in 1993 when scientists supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) discovered that mutations in the SOD1 gene were associated with some cases of familial ALS. Although it is still not clear how mutations in the SOD1 gene lead to motor neuron degeneration, there is increasing evidence that the gene playing a role in producing mutant SOD1 protein can become toxic.''Since then, more than a dozen additional genetic mutations have been identified, many through NINDS-supported research, and each of these gene discoveries is providing new insights into possible mechanisms of ALS.''The discovery of certain genetic mutations involved in ALS suggests that changes in the processing of RNA molecules may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration. RNA molecules are one of the major macromolecules in the cell involved in directing the synthesis of specific proteins as well as gene regulation and activity.''Other gene mutations indicate defects in the natural process in which malfunctioning proteins are broken down and used to build new ones, known as protein recycling. Still others point to possible defects in the structure and shape of motor neurons, as well as increased susceptibility to environmental toxins. Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cellular defects can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.''In 2011 another important discovery was made when scientists found that a defect in the C9ORF72 gene is not only present in a significant subset of individuals with ALS but also in some people with a type of ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD). This observation provides evidence for genetic ties between these two neurodegenerative disorders. Most researchers now believe ALS and some forms of FTD are related disorders.''In searching for the cause of ALS, researchers are also studying the impact of environmental factors. Researchers are investigating a number of possible causes such as exposure to toxic or infectious agents, ''viruses'', physical ''trauma'', ''diet'', and behavioral and occupational factors.''For example, researchers have suggested that exposure to toxins during warfare, or strenuous physical activity, are possible reasons for why some veterans and athletes may be at increased risk of developing ALS.''Although there has been no consistent association between any environmental factor and the risk of developing ALS, future research may show that some factors are involved in the development or progression of the disease.' "
Is there a test for ALS?,"'No one test can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS. ALS is primarily diagnosed based on detailed history of the symptoms and signs observed by a physician during physical examination along with a series of tests to rule out other mimicking diseases. However, the presence of upper and lower motor neuron symptoms strongly suggests the presence of the disease.''Physicians will review an individual’s full medical history and conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, and spasticity are getting progressively worse.''ALS symptoms in the early stages of the disease can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders. Appropriate tests can exclude the possibility of other conditions.''Electromyography (''EMG''), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity of muscle fibers, can help diagnose ALS. Another common test is a nerve conduction study (NCS), which measures electrical activity of the nerves and muscles by assessing the nerve’s ability to send a signal along the nerve or to the muscle. Specific abnormalities in the NCS and EMG may suggest, for example, that the individual has a form of ''peripheral neuropathy'' (damage to peripheral nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS.''A physician may also order a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') test, a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Standard MRI scans are generally normal in people with ALS. However, they can reveal other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord ''tumor'', a ''herniated disk'' in the neck that compresses the spinal cord, syringomyelia (a ''cyst'' in the spinal cord), or cervical spondylosis (abnormal wear affecting the spine in the neck).''Based on the person’s symptoms, test results, and findings from the examination, a physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases.''Infectious diseases such as ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), human T-cell ''leukemia'' virus (HTLV), ''polio'', and ''West Nile virus'' can, in some cases, cause ALS-like symptoms. Neurological disorders such as ''multiple sclerosis'', ''post-polio syndrome'', multifocal motor neuropathy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy’s disease) also can mimic certain features of the disease and should be considered by physicians attempting to make a diagnosis. Fasciculations and muscle ''cramps'' also occur in benign conditions.''Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early stages of the disease, individuals may wish to obtain a second neurological opinion.' "
What is the treatment for the symtptoms of ALS? Is there cure?,"'No cure has yet been found for ALS. However, there are treatments available that can help control symptoms, prevent unnecessary complications, and make living with the disease easier.''Supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; respiratory therapists and clinical psychologists; and home care and ''hospice'' nurses. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ''drugs'' riluzole (Rilutek) and edaravone (Radicava) to treat ALS. Riluzole is believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing levels of glutamate, which transports messages between nerve cells and motor neurons. Clinical trials in people with ALS showed that riluzole prolongs survival by a few months, particularly in the bulbar form of the disease, but does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons. Edaravone has been shown to slow the decline in clinical assessment of daily functioning in persons with ALS.''Physicians can also prescribe medications to help manage symptoms of ALS, including muscle cramps, stiffness, excess saliva and ''phlegm'', and the pseudobulbar affect (involuntary or uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays). Drugs also are available to help individuals with ''pain'', ''depression'', ''sleep'' disturbances, and ''constipation''. Pharmacists can give advice on the proper use of medications and monitor a person’s prescriptions to avoid risks of ''drug interactions''.''Physical therapy and special equipment can enhance an individual’s independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact ''aerobic exercise'' such as walking, ''swimming'', and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help people fight ''fatigue'' and ''depression''.

What are antinuclear antibodies?,"'We normally have antibodies in our blood that repel invaders in our bodies, such as virus and bacteria microbes. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are unusual antibodies, detectable in the blood, that have the capability of binding to certain structures within the nucleus of the cells. The nucleus is the innermost core within the body\'s cells and contains the DNA, the primary genetic material. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system may be predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one\'s own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs suggest the possible presence of autoimmunity. Therefore, when they are detected in a patient\'s blood (referred to as a ""positive"" result), doctors will consider the possibility that an autoimmune illness exists in that patient.''Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which there is a disorder of the immune system characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases typically feature inflammation of various tissues of the body. Frequently, ANAs are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''polymyositis'', ''scleroderma'"", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'', juvenile ''diabetes mellitus'', Addison disease, ''vitiligo'', ''pernicious anemia'', glomerulonephritis, and ''pulmonary fibrosis''. ANAs can also be found in patients with conditions that are not considered classic autoimmune diseases, such as chronic infections and ''cancer''.' "
Who created the ANA test? How do health care professionals perform the procedure?,"'The ANA test was designed by Dr. George Friou in 1957. The ANA test is performed using a blood sample. An ANA test is performed by testing the blood in the laboratory. The antibodies in the serum of the blood are exposed in the laboratory to cells. It is then determined whether or not antibodies are present that react to various parts of the nucleus of cells. Thus, the term anti-""nuclear"" antibody. Fluorescence techniques are frequently used to actually detect the antibodies in the cells, thus ANA testing is sometimes referred to as fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).' "
What is the interpretation of the ANA screen result?,"'The ANA test is a sensitive screening test used to detect autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases feature a misdirected immune system, and each of them has characteristic clinical manifestations that are used to make the precise diagnosis. The interpretation or identification of a positive ANA test does not make a diagnosis. It simply suggests to the doctor to consider the possibility that an autoimmune disease is present.'  "
What non-autoimmune conditions produce ANAs?,"'ANAs can be produced in patients with infections (virus or bacteria), lung diseases (primary ''pulmonary fibrosis'', ''pulmonary hypertension''), gastrointestinal diseases (''ulcerative colitis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'primary biliary cirrhosis'', alcoholic ''liver disease'""), hormonal diseases (Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis, """"Grave's disease""'), blood diseases (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'', hemolytic ''anemia''), ''cancers'' (''melanoma'', breast, lung, kidney, ovarian and others), skin diseases (''psoriasis'', pemphigus), as well as in the elderly and those people with a family history of rheumatic diseases.'  "
Can medications cause elevated ANAs?,"'Many medications can sometimes stimulate the production of ANAs, including ''procainamide'' (Procan SR), ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline''), and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''). ANAs that are stimulated by medication are referred to as drug-induced ANAs. This does not necessarily mean that any disease is present when these ANAs are ""induced."" Sometimes diseases are associated with these ANAs, and they are referred to as drug-induced diseases.' "
ANAs are defined as having patterns. What does this mean?,"'ANAs present different ""patterns"" depending on the staining of the cell nucleus in the laboratory: homogeneous or diffuse pattern; speckled pattern; nucleolar pattern; and peripheral or rim pattern. While these patterns are not specific for any one illness, certain illnesses can more frequently be associated with one pattern or another. The patterns then can sometimes give the doctor further clues as to types of illnesses to look for in evaluating a patient. For example, the nucleolar pattern is more commonly seen in the disease ''scleroderma''. The speckled pattern is seen in many conditions and in people who do not have any autoimmune disease. These patterns are determined by technical experts who routinely interpret the tests.' "
Are ANAs always associated with illness? What is the normal range?,"""No. ANAs can be found in approximately 5% of the normal population, usually in low titers (low levels). These people usually have no disease. Titers of 1:80 or lower are less likely to be significant. (ANA titers of less than or equal to 1:40 are considered negative.) Even higher titers are often insignificant in patients over 60 years of age. Ultimately, the ANA result must be interpreted in the specific context of an individual patient's symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and other test results. It may or may not be significant, even if positive, in a given individual."" "
What are anabolic steroids?,"'Anabolic steroids are one type of performance-enhancing drug or medication. They mimic testosterone in the body to enhance performance by making muscle cells larger and by allowing the body to recover more quickly from the ''stress'' of ''exercise''. Slang for anabolic steroids is ''roids''.'""Performance-enhancing drugs are no longer just for bodybuilders or pro athletes who are willing to try illegal and potentially dangerous means to improve their body's function. These drugs are being used every day by people of all ages, from middle-school, high-school, and college students to older recreational athletes.""'There are two types of steroids that the body naturally produces:''Catabolic steroids'"" or glucocorticoids are part of the body's response to ""'stress''. The word ''catabolic'' comes from the Greek word meaning to ""throw down,"" and these steroids help break down large chemicals into smaller ones. For example, cortisol helps glycogen (a large molecule that is stored in the ''liver'') metabolize into glucose, a small molecule that can be used for energy by the body. The adrenal glands naturally manufacture cortisol, and it is required for many of the basic functions of the body, including glucose metabolism, the immune response to infection, and protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Prescription medications, such as ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''), hydrocortisone (''Westcort''), and ''dexamethasone'' (Decadron [discontinued], DexPak), are examples of steroids that are used to reduce inflammation and treat a range of illnesses from ''asthma'' and ''COPD'' to ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''allergic'' reactions. Low-dose hydrocortisone is the active ingredient in creams that help treat the inflammation from ''insect bites'', ''poison ivy'', ''eczema'', and other local skin irritations.''Anabolic androgenic steroids'' are steroids that mimic testosterone in the body. Anabolic refers to the properties of these drugs to increase production of proteins that act as building blocks for muscle cells, bone, and other tissues within the body. The androgenic response (andro=male + genic=formation) describes the increased male features (secondary sexual characteristics) that occur as a result of androgenic steroids, including facial, body, and pubic hair, deepened voice, and increased sex drive or libido.''There are medical indications for prescribing these medications. Some include the following:''Some physicians believe that the decreased testosterone levels that occurs normally with ''aging'' is an indication for replacement therapy with anabolic steroids, but their use in otherwise healthy older patients is still controversial because of the potential serious side effects.''Chemists have manufactured many different types of anabolic steroids over the past decades. The goal of chemists is to promote the anabolic effect of the drug while decreasing the androgenic side effects that can be life-threatening. Examples of anabolic steroids include the following:' Inadequate testosterone production in the body, either because of inborn errors of metabolism or because of illnesses that decrease production Certain types of anemia Recovery from major illness or injury, including burns, where the body's metabolism needs to be increased to produce more protein An adjunct treatment for certain types of breast cancer Hereditary angioedema HIV wasting syndrome Growth failure and short statures in the pediatric population Testosterone (Axiron, Androgel, Fortesta, Testopel, Striant, Delatestryl, Testim, Androderm) Androstenedione Stanozolol (Winstrol) Nandrolone (Deca-Durabolin) Methandrosteolone (Dianabol)"
Why do people abuse anabolic steroids?,"'People abuse steroids for a variety of reasons, but most do it to increase body performance and appearance. There may be peer pressure to use anabolic steroids in some sports because of a fear that normal training will not be enough to succeed. There is also the perception that other athletes are abusing steroids and gaining an unfair advantage.''People who use steroids to enhance their appearance by increasing muscle and decreasing fat may suffer from muscle dysmorphia or abnormal perception of their own body. Males may think that they are perpetually too small and weak, and females may think themselves fat, even though that perception may not be actually true.''Bodybuilders and weight lifters are not the only athletes to think that anabolic steroid use is their road to success. Athletes, from strength sports like football and throwing the discus to speed sports like track sprinters and speed skaters, have attempted to use steroids to enhance performance and increase the efficiency of their training.' "
How do people abuse anabolic steroids?,"'Though most anabolic steroids need to be injected into the body to be effective, some may be taken by mouth and others used as a cream or gel and applied to the skin. The user will try to take enough anabolic steroid to increase the ability to ''exercise'' and allow muscles to grow while minimizing the risk of side effects and the potential of being caught. Usually people take steroids in cycles with regular injections followed by periods of rest. Numerous books and web sites discuss the benefits and risks of different techniques to maximize the effect of a variety of steroids on the body. There is a large underground illegal industry that has grown to meet the demand for anabolic steroids and provides methods to try to avoid detection.''Cycling'', stacking, and pyramiding are three common ways that anabolic steroid abusers take their drugs. Cycling refers to taking a steroid for a period, stopping for the body to rest, and then restarting again. If people use more than one type of steroid at a time, this is called stacking. There is the belief that using two or more steroids at a time increases the effectiveness of each. Pyramiding combines the cycling and stacking. One or more steroids are begun in a low dose and the dose gradually increased until halfway through the cycle where the amount is maximized and it is then tapered to zero by the end of the cycle.''Tailor exercise programs so that more can be done as the effect of the steroid increases. The cycles of steroid use are usually six to 12 weeks long, followed by a rest period.''In athletes who use anabolic steroids, a cat and mouse game exists. They try to time their steroid injections so that the drug is out of their system during drug testing. Sometimes people take masking drugs to try to ""beat"" the test by making the test negative. Chemists continually develop designer steroids to again prevent their use from being detected.' "
Are anabolic steroids addictive? What are the symptoms and signs of anabolic steroid abuse?,"'Like ''alcohol'' or street drugs, the common signs of ''addiction'' may develop with the use of steroids. These include drug cravings, requiring more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal symptoms if someone stops the drug. The following is a statement from the National Institute of ''Drug Abuse'' concerning anabolic steroids:''""An undetermined percentage of steroid abusers may become addicted to the drugs, as evidenced by their continued abuse despite physical problems and negative effects on social relations. Also, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drugs, which is another indication that they may be addicted. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking steroids, such as''The most dangerous of the withdrawal symptoms is ''depression'', because it sometimes leads to ''suicide'' attempts. If left untreated, some depressive symptoms associated with anabolic steroid withdrawal have been known to persist for a year or more after the abuser stops taking the drugs.""' mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, insomnia, reduced sex drive, and steroid cravings."
What are the psychological and physical side effects of anabolic steroid abuse?,"   Anabolic steroids are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase the ability to do work and exercise by abnormally stimulating muscle growth, power, and aerobic capacity. This increased function comes with a cost of potentially life-threatening side effects. The complications of anabolic steroid abuse are a result of excess testosterone affecting almost all the organ systems in the body. Some of the effects are reversible and decrease when the drug abuse stops while others are permanent and irreversible. In males, the excess steroid suppresses the normal testosterone production in the body. This can lead to shrunken testicles and decreased sperm count, baldness, and breast development (gynecomastia). In females, anabolic steroid abuse can lead to masculinization with loss of body fat and breast size, swelling of the clitoris (which may be permanent and not resolve, even though a woman stops using steroids), deepening of the voice, and the development of facial and body hair. Life-threatening side effects includeheart attack and stroke,the risk of forming blood clots (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus),liver cancer, andliver failure. heart attack and stroke, the risk of forming blood clots (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus), liver cancer, and liver failure. Excess steroid use often affects the skin, and the issues are similar to the adolescent male going through puberty with its testosterone spike. Hair can become oily. Acne is often present. Acne conglobata is a particularly severe form of acne that can develop during steroid abuse or even after a person stops taking the drug. Infections are a common side effect of steroid abuse because of needle sharing and unsanitary techniques used when injecting the drugs into the skin. These are similar risks to IV drug abusers with increased potential to acquire blood-borne infections such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. Skin abscesses may occur at injection sites and may spread to other organs of the body. Endocarditis or an infection of the heart valves is not uncommon. Psychiatric and psychological complications include manic behavior and psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. Aggressive behavior is common and known as ""roid rage."" Because the muscle growth can occur quickly, it can cause stress on the tendons that attach the muscle to bone and those who abuse anabolic steroids are at risk for tendon rupture. Anabolic steroids can increase bone production, especially in the skull and face. Teeth can splay apart as the maxilla and mandible grow. There can be overgrowth of the forehead, giving an ""Incredible Hulk"" appearance. If adolescent teenagers abuse steroids before they have finished growing, these drugs can prematurely close bone growth plates, leading to short stature."
How do health care professionals diagnose anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'The diagnosis of anabolic steroid abuse in high school, college, and professional athletes may occur with a failed drug test, but many people who abuse these drugs are never randomly tested. Doctors often make the diagnosis when someone develops one of the side effects of steroid use.''Once the potential diagnosis of drug abuse is considered, it is important that the health care provider offer the opportunity for the patient to consider drug treatment options, just like any other addictive drug. However, the patient must take the first step in diagnosis and treatment by admitting there is a potential for abuse and their willingness to consider intervention and treatment.' "
What is the treatment for anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'Counseling is the mainstay of therapy for anabolic steroid abuse. The patient and their support group, family and friends, need to appreciate that the approach to this addiction may be similar to addiction to other drugs and alcohol.''Depression'' and ''suicidal thoughts'' may occur when one stops taking steroids, and this potential must be monitored closely.''Withdrawal symptoms vary with each patient, and the health care professional may need to prescribe short courses of medications to help with ''headaches'', muscle aches, and ''insomnia''.' "
Is it possible to prevent anabolic steroid abuse and addiction?,"'Prevention of steroid abuse begins at a young age. There is pressure even at middle school to take drugs to increase performance on the playing field and in the gym. As well, personal appearance and perception begin early on. Unrealistic expectations can drive adolescent boys and girls to try to achieve the often unrealistic image of models in fashion magazines and athletes in the gym.''Counseling and guidance that continues through high school and beyond effectively decreases steroid use in the younger population.''According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the use of anabolic steroids continues to be a significant problem in the adolescent population. Their continuing monitoring studies found that in 2014 the following percentage of students used anabolic steroids in the past year:''Over their lifetime, 1.9% of the 12th graders had abused steroids.'  8th grade, 0.6% 10th grade, 0.7% 12th grade, 0.6%"
Where can I get more information on anabolic steroid abuse?,"'While there are many web sites that teach people how to abuse anabolic steroids without being caught, there are also many that can educate about their benefits, risks, and dangers. Examples include the following:''""Anabolic Steroid Abuse,"" National Institute on Drug Abuse''http://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/steroids-anabolic''""NIDA InfoFacts: Steroids (Anabolic-Androgenic),"" National Institute on Drug Abuse''http://www.drugabuse.gov/infofacts/steroids.html''""Research Report Series - Anabolic Steroid Abuse,"" National Institute on Drug Abuse''http://www.nida.nih.gov/ResearchReports/Steroids/anabolicsteroids5.html#addictive' "
What should I know about anal fissures?,"'An anal fissure is a cut or tear occurring in the anus (the opening through which ''stool'' passes out of the body) that extends upwards into the anal canal. Fissures are a common condition of the anus and anal canal and are responsible for 6% to 15% of the visits to a colon and rectal (''colorectal'') surgeon. They affect men and women equally and both the young and the old. Fissures usually cause ''pain'' during bowel movements that often is severe. Anal fissure is the most common cause of ''rectal bleeding'' in infancy.''Anal fissures occur in the specialized tissue that lines the anus and anal canal, called anoderm. At a line just inside the anus (referred to as the anal verge or intersphincteric groove) the skin (dermis) of the inner buttocks changes to anoderm. Unlike skin, anoderm has no hairs, sweat glands, or sebaceous (oil) glands and contains a larger number of sensory nerves that sense light touch and ''pain''. (The abundance of nerves explains why anal fissures are so painful.) The hairless, gland-less, extremely sensitive anoderm continues for the entire length of the anal canal until it meets the demarcating line for the rectum, called the dentate line. (The rectum is the distal 15 cm of the colon that lies just above the anal canal and just below the sigmoid colon.)''Anal fissures are caused primarily by ''trauma'', but several non-traumatic diseases are associated with anal fissures and should be suspected if fissures occur in unusual locations.''Anal fissures are diagnosed and evaluated by visual inspection of the anus and anal canal.''Anal fissures are initially treated conservatively with home remedies and OTC products that include adding bulk to the ''stool'', softening the stool, consuming a high ''fiber'' ''diet'', and utilizing sitz baths.''Prescription ''drugs'' used to treat anal fissures that fail to heal with less conservative treatment are ointments containing anesthetics, steroids, ''nitroglycerin'', and calcium channel blocking drugs (''CCBs'').''Surgery by lateral sphincterotomy is the gold standard for curing anal fissures. Because of complications, however, it is reserved for patients who are intolerant of non-surgical treatments or in whom non-surgical treatments have proven to be ineffective.' The primary symptom of anal fissures is pain during and following bowel movements. Other symptoms that may occur are bleeding, itching, and a malodorous discharge."
What are the signs and symptoms of anal fissures?,"'People with anal fissures almost always experience anal pain that worsens with bowel movements.''As previously mentioned, anal fissures commonly bleed in infants.'   The pain following a bowel movement may be brief or long lasting; however, the pain usually subsides between bowel movements. The pain can be so severe that patients are unwilling to have a bowel movement, resulting in constipation and even fecal impaction. Moreover, constipation can result in the passage of a larger, harder stool that causes further trauma and makes the fissure worse. The pain also can affect urination by causing discomfort when urinating (dysuria), frequent urination, or the inability to urinate. Bleeding in small amounts, itching (pruritus ani), and a malodorous discharge may occur due to the discharge of pus from the fissure."
What causes anal fissures?,"'Anal fissures are caused by trauma to the anus and anal canal. The cause of the trauma usually is a bowel movement, and many people can remember the exact bowel movement during which their pain began. The fissure may be caused by a hard stool or repeated episodes of ''diarrhea''. Occasionally, the insertion of a rectal thermometer, enema tip, endoscope, or ''ultrasound'' probe (for examining the ''prostate gland'') can result in sufficient trauma to produce a fissure. During ''childbirth'', trauma to the perineum (the skin between the posterior vagina and the anus) may cause a tear that extends into the anoderm.''The most common location for an anal fissure in both men and women (90% of all fissures) is the midline posteriorly in the anal canal, the part of the anus nearest the spine. Fissures are more common posteriorly because of the configuration of the muscle that surrounds the anus. This muscle complex, referred to as the external and internal anal sphincters, underlies and supports the anal canal. The sphincters are oval-shaped and are best supported at their sides and weakest posteriorly. When tears occur in the anoderm, therefore, they are more likely to be posterior. In women, there also is weak support for the anterior anal canal due to the presence of the vagina anterior to the anus. For this reason, 10% of fissures in women are anterior, while only 1% are anterior in men. At the lower end of fissures a tag of skin may form, called a sentinel pile.''When fissures occur in locations other than the midline posteriorly or anteriorly, they should raise the suspicion that a problem other than trauma is the cause. Other causes of fissures are ''anal cancer'"", Crohn's disease, ""'leukemia'' as well as many infectious diseases including ''tuberculosis'', viral infections (''cytomegalovirus'' or ''herpes''), ''syphilis'', ''gonorrhea'', ''Chlamydia'' , ''chancroid'' (''Hemophilus ducreyi''), and ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'""). Among patients with Crohn's disease, 4% will have an anal fissure as the first manifestation of their Crohn's disease, and half of all patients with Crohn's disease eventually will develop an anal ulceration that may look like a fissure.""'Studies of the anal canal in patients with anal fissures consistently show that the muscles surrounding the anal canal are contracting too strongly (they are in spasm), thereby generating a pressure in the canal that is abnormally high. The two muscles that surround the anal canal are the external anal sphincter and the internal anal sphincter (already discussed). The external anal sphincter is a voluntary (striated) muscle, that is, it can be controlled consciously. Thus, when we need to have a bowel movement we can either tighten the external sphincter and prevent the bowel movement, or we can relax it and allow the bowel movement. On the other hand, the internal anal sphincter is an involuntary (smooth) muscle, that is, a muscle we cannot control. The internal sphincter is constantly contracted and normally prevents small amounts of stool from leaking from the rectum. When a substantial load of stool reaches the rectum, as it does just prior to a bowel movement, the internal anal sphincter relaxes automatically to let the stool pass (that is, unless the external anal sphincter is consciously tightened).''When an anal fissure is present, the internal anal sphincter is in spasm. In addition, after the sphincter finally does relax to allow a bowel movement to pass, instead of going back to its resting level of contraction and pressure, the internal anal sphincter contracts even more vigorously for a few seconds before it goes back to its elevated resting level of contraction. It is thought that the high resting pressure and the ""overshoot"" contraction of the internal anal sphincter following a bowel movement pull the edges of the fissure apart and prevent the fissure from healing.''The supply of blood to the anus and anal canal also may play a role in the poor healing of anal fissures. Anatomic and microscopic studies of the anal canal on cadavers found that in 85% of individuals that the posterior part of the anal canal (where most fissures occur) has less blood flowing to it than the other parts of the anal canal. Moreover, ultrasound studies that measure the flow of blood showed that the posterior anal canal had less than half of the blood flow of other parts of the canal. This relatively poor flow of blood may be a factor in preventing fissures from healing. It also is possible that the increased pressure in the anal canal due to spasm of the internal anal sphincter may compress the blood vessels of the anal canal and further reduce the flow of blood.'  "
"What exams, procedures, and tests diagnose anal fissures?","'A careful history usually suggests that an anal fissure is present, and gentle inspection of the anus can confirm the presence of a fissure. If gentle eversion (pulling apart) the edges of the anus by separating the buttocks does not reveal a fissure, a more vigorous examination following the application of a topical anesthetic to the anus and anal canal may be necessary. A cotton-tipped swab may be inserted into the anus to gently localize the source of the pain.''An acute anal fissure looks like a linear tear. A chronic anal fissure frequently is associated with a triad of findings that includes a tag of skin at the edge of the anus (sentinel pile), thickened edges of the fissure with muscle fibers of the internal sphincter visible at the base of the fissure, and an enlarged anal papilla at the upper end of the fissure in the anal canal.''If ''rectal bleeding'' is present, an endoscopic evaluation using a rigid or flexible viewing tube is necessary to exclude the possibility of a more serious disease of the anus and rectum. A ''sigmoidoscopy'' that examines only the distal part of the colon may be reasonable in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a typical anal fissure. In patients with a family history of ''colon cancer'' or age greater than 50 (and, therefore, at higher risk for colon ''cancer''), a ''colonoscopy'' that examines the entire colon is recommended. Atypical fissures that suggest the presence of other diseases, as discussed previously, require other diagnostic studies including colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small intestinal ''X-rays''.'  "
What home remedies and over-the-counter drugs treat anal fissures?,"'The goal of treatment for anal fissures is to break the cycle of spasm of the anal sphincter and its repeated tearing of the anoderm. In acute fissures, medical (nonoperative) therapy is successful in the majority of patients. Of acute fissures, 80% to 90% will heal with conservative measures as compared with chronic (recurrent) fissures, which show only a 40% rate of healing. Initial treatment involves adding bulk to the stool and softening the stool with psyllium or methylcellulose preparations and a high fiber ''diet''.''Other home remedies for anal fisures include avoiding ""sharp"" foods that may not be well-digested (i.e., nuts, popcorn, tortilla chips); increase liquid intake, and, at times, take stool softeners (''docusate'' or mineral oil preparations). Sitz baths (essentially soaking in a tub of warm water). Sitz baths are encouraged, particularly after bowel movements, to relax the spasm, to increase the flow of blood to the anus, and to clean the anus without rubbing the irritated anoderm.''The author has found that when there are enlarged internal ''hemorrhoids'' in addition to a fissure, that healing of the fissure is improved if the ''hemorrhoids'' are treated with ''sclerotherapy'' that shrinks them. After application of a topical anesthetic, if a patient can tolerate a gentle examination of the rectum with a finger and an anoscope can be inserted through the anus, enlarged ''hemorrhoids'' can be identified, and if present, treated with sclerotherapy. (It is unclear if improvement in healing is caused by anal dilation with the finger or by shrinkage of the ''hemorrhoid''.)'  "
What prescription drugs treat anal fissures?,"'Topical anesthetics (for example, ''xylocaine'', ''lidocaine'', tetracaine, ''pramoxine'') are recommended especially prior to a bowel movement to reduce the pain of defecation. Often, a small amount of a steroid is combined in the anesthetic cream to reduce inflammation. The use of steroids should be limited to two weeks because longer use will result in thinning of the anoderm (atrophy), which makes it more susceptible to trauma. Oral medications to relax the smooth muscle of the internal sphincter have not been shown to aid healing.''Because of the possibility that spasm of the internal sphincter and reduced flow of blood to the sphincter play roles in the formation and healing of anal fissures, ointments with the muscle relaxant, nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), have been tried and found to be effective in healing anal fissures. ''Glycerin'' trinitrate (nitroglycerin) has been shown to cause relaxation of the internal anal sphincter and to decrease the anal resting pressure. When ointments containing nitroglycerin are applied to the anal canal, the nitroglycerin diffuses across the anoderm and relaxes the internal sphincter and reduces the pressure in the anal canal. This relieves spasm of the muscle and also may increase the flow of blood, both of which promote healing of fissures. Unlike Nitropaste, a 2.0% concentration of nitroglycerin that is used on the skin for patients with ''heart disease'' and ''angina'', the nitroglycerin ointment used for treating anal fissures contains a concentration of nitroglycerin of only 0.2%. One randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated the healing of anal fissures in 68% of patients with nitroglycerin as compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo (inactive treatment). Other studies have shown a 33% to 47% recurrence rate of fissures following treatment with nitroglycerin. The presence of a sentinel pile is associated with a lower healing rate with nitroglycerin treatment.''The dose of nitroglycerin often is limited by side effects. The usual side effects are ''headache'' (due to dilation of blood vessels in the head) or light-headedness (due to a drop in ''blood pressure''). This author recommends that a small amount of ointment be applied to a cotton-tipped swab with the swab then inserted into the anus only for the depth of the cotton-tipped portion of the swab. Ointment smeared only around the outside of the anus does not reach the anoderm where its effects are important, yet the nitroglycerin will be absorbed and produce side effects.''Nitroglycerin is more rapidly absorbed if blood flow in the anoderm is high. For this reason, it is recommended that nitroglycerin not be applied within 30 minutes of a bath since the warm water of the bath enlarges (dilates) the blood vessels in the skin and anoderm and increases their flow of blood. Additionally, the first application of nitroglycerin should be at bedtime while the patient is lying down in order to prevent falls due to light-headedness.''The side effects of nitroglycerin often are self-limited, that is, they become less with repeated use. ''Caffeine'' can help reduce or prevent ''headaches''. However, if side effects are pronounced, nitroglycerin should be discontinued. Drugs for ''impotence'' (for example, ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), should not be used together with nitroglycerin since they increase the risk of developing ''low blood pressure''.''As is the case with nitroglycerin, ointments containing calcium channel blocking drugs (for example, ''nifedipine'' [Adalat] or ''diltiazem'' [''Cardizem'']) relax the muscles of the internal sphincter. They also expand the blood vessels of the anoderm and increase the flow of blood. Nifedipine ointment (2%) is applied in a manner similar to nitroglycerin ointment, but seems to produce fewer side effects. Although healing of chronic fissures has been reported in up to 67% of patients treated with ''calcium channel blockers'', they are most effective with acute fissures.''Botulinum toxin (''Botox'') relaxes (actually paralyzes) muscles by preventing the release of acetylcholine from the nerves that normally causes muscle cells to contract. It has been used successfully to treat a variety of disorders in which there is spasm of muscles, including anal fissures. The toxin is injected into the external sphincter, the internal sphincter, the intersphincteric groove (an indentation just inside the anus that demarcates the dividing line between external and internal sphincters), or into the fissure itself. The dose is not standardized and has varied from 2.5 to 20 units of toxin in two locations (usually on either side of the fissure). The cost of a 100-unit vial of toxin is several hundred dollars and unused toxin cannot be saved. Thus, the expense for a single injection of toxin is high. In some series of patients but not all, the frequency of healing of fissures with botulinum toxin is high. When fissures recur after treatment, they usually heal again with a second injection. One representative study found that fissures healed in 87% of patients by six months after treatment with botulinum toxin. By 12 months, however, the healing rate had fallen to 75% and by 42 months to 60%. The primary side effect of botulinum toxin is ''weakness'' of the sphincters with varying degrees of ''incontinence'' (leakage of stool) that usually is transient. Other side effects are not common.''There is a great variability in the medical literature with respect to the effectiveness of drugs and botulinum toxin in the healing of anal fissures. Healing may be temporary and fissures may return with a hard bowel movement. Recurrent fissures often require a change to another form of treatment. Patients need to balance the effectiveness of treatment, short and long-term side effects, convenience, and expense in choosing their treatment. When patients are intolerant or unresponsive to non-surgical treatments, surgery becomes necessary.' "
Does surgery cure anal fissures?,"'The Standard Task Force of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons has recommended a surgical procedure called partial lateral internal sphincterotomy as the technique of choice for the treatment of anal fissures. In this procedure, the internal anal sphincter is cut starting at its distal most end at the anal verge and extending into the anal canal for a distance equal to that of the fissure. The cut may extend to the dentate line, but not farther. The sphincter can be divided in a closed (percutaneous) fashion by tunneling under the anoderm or in an open fashion by cutting through the anoderm. The cut is made on the left or right side of the anus, hence the name ""partial lateral internal sphincterotomy."" The posterior midline, where the fissure usually is located, is avoided for fear of accentuating the posterior weakness of the muscle surrounding the anal canal. (Additional weakness posteriorly can lead to what is called a keyhole deformity, so called because the resulting anal canal resembles an old fashioned skeleton key. This deformity promotes soilage and leakage of stool.)''Although many surgeons decline to cut out the fissure itself during lateral sphincterotomy, this author feels that this reluctance to remove the fissure is not always appropriate, and characteristics of the fissure itself should be taken into account. If the fissure is hard and irregular, suggesting ''anal cancer'', the fissure should be biopsied. If the edges and base of the fissure are heavily scarred, there may be a problem after surgery with anal stenosis, a condition in which additional scarring narrows the anal canal and interferes with the passage of stool. In this case, it may be better to cut out the scarred fissure so that there is a chance for the ''wound'' to heal with less scarring and chance of stenosis. Finally, an associated large anal papilla or a large hemorrhoidal tag may interfere physically with wound healing, and removing them may promote healing.''Following surgery, 93% to 97% of fissures heal. In one representative study, healing following surgery occurred in 98% of patients by two months. At 42 months following surgery, 94% of patients were still healed. Recurrence rates after this type of surgery are low, 0% to 3%.'""Failure to heal following surgery often is attributed to reluctance on the part of the surgeon to adequately divide the internal anal sphincter; however, other reasons for failure to heal, such as Crohn's disease should be considered as well. The risk of incontinence (leakage) of stool following surgery is low. It is important to distinguish between short-term and long-term incontinence. In the short-term (under six weeks), the sphincter is weakened by the surgery, so leakage of stool is not unexpected. Long-term incontinence should not occur after partial lateral internal sphincterotomy because the internal sphincter is less important than the external sphincter (which is not cut) in controlling the passage of stool. It is important to distinguish between incontinence to ""'gas'', a minimal amount of stool that, at most, stains the underwear (soiling), and loss of stool that requires an immediate change in underwear. In a large series of patients followed for a mean of five years after surgery, 6% were ''incontinent'' of gas, 8% had minor soiling, and 1% experienced loss of stool.''Several surgeons have described procedures that stretch and tear the anal sphincters for the treatment of anal fissures. Though anal stretching often is successful in alleviating pain and healing the fissure, it is a traumatic, uncontrolled disruption of the sphincter. Ultrasonograms of the anal sphincters following stretching demonstrate trauma that extends beyond the desired area. Because only 72% of fissures heal and there is a 20% incidence of incontinence of stool, stretching has fallen out of favor.' "
What is anal itching (pruritus ani)?,"'Anal itching (known medically as pruritus ani) is irritation of the skin at the opening of the anal canal through which ''stool'' exits the body that leads to itching. The skin surrounding the opening is known as the anus. The itching is accompanied by the desire to scratch. Although itching may be a reaction to chemicals in the stool, it often implies that there is inflammation of the anal area. The intensity of anal itching and the amount of inflammation increases with the direct ''trauma'' of scratching and the presence of moisture. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is described as burning and soreness.' "
What are common causes of anal itching?,"'Other problems that can cause anal ''itch'' include:' An itchy bottom can be caused by irritating chemicals in the foods we eat, such as are found in spices, hot sauces, and peppers. Anal itching also can be caused by the irritation of continuous moisture in the anus from frequent liquid stools, diarrhea, or escape of small amounts of stool (incontinence or fecal soilage). Moisture increases the possibility of infections of the anus, especially yeast, particularly in patients with diabetes or HIV. Treatment with antibiotics can lead to a yeast infection and irritation of the anus. Psoriasis can irritate the anus. Abnormal passageways (fistulas) from the small intestine or colon to the skin surrounding the anus can form as a result of medical conditions (such as Crohn's disease), and these fistulas bring irritating fluids to the anal area. Rarely, tumors of the anus (anal cancer) may be the cause of itching. Pinworms, Hemorrhoids, Tears of the anal skin (fissures), and Skin tags (abnormal local growth of anal skin)."
What are additional symptoms associated with anal itching?," The intensity of anal itching and the amount of inflammation increases from the direct trauma of scratching and the presence of moisture. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is described as burning and soreness, especially during and after bowel movements. There also may be small amounts of bleeding."
What kind of doctor treats anal itching?,"'Although anal itching can be evaluated by a family practice or internal medicine physician, it most often is evaluated by a ''colorectal'' surgeon (proctologist) and sometimes by a ''gastroenterologist''.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of anal itching?,"'Anal itching is first evaluated with a careful examination of the anus for such abnormalities as ''hemorrhoids'', anal fissures, skin tags, moisture, and excoriations (breaks in the skin from scratching).''A rectal examination with a finger inserted into the anal canal can identify rectal tumors. For a closer look at the anal canal, a proctoscope can be used. A proctoscope is a short tube that is inserted through the anus and into the rectum so that the anal canal can be examined visually If pinworms are suspected, they and their eggs can be identified using the ''pinworm test'', a test in which the worms and eggs are recovered from the anus using transparent adhesive tape.' "
What are treatment options and home remedies for anal itching?,"'Initial self-care for simple itching is directed toward relieving symptoms, like burning and soreness. It is important to clean and dry the anus thoroughly and avoid leaving soap in the anal area.''Many ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) products are sold for the treatment of an itchy anus and are available as ointments, creams, gels, suppositories, foams and pads. These products often contain the same ''drugs'' used to treat hemorrhoids.''Most products contain more than one type of active ingredient. Almost all contain a protectant in addition to another ingredient. Only examples of brand-name products containing one ingredient in addition to the protectant are discussed in this article.' Cleaning efforts should include gentle showering without direct rubbing or irritation of the skin with either the washcloth or towel. After bowel movements, moist pads (such as baby wipes, flushable moist wipes, and flushable anal cleansing wipes) should be used for cleaning the anus instead of toilet paper. If there is constant moisture present in the anus or stool incontinence, it may be necessary to clean the anus with wet wipes between bowel movements. When used around the anus, ointments, creams, and gels should be applied as a thin covering. When applied to the anal canal, these products should be inserted with a finger using finger cots (latex covers for the fingertips) or a ""pile pipe."" Pile pipes are most efficient when they have holes on the sides as well as at the end. Pile pipes should be lubricated with ointment prior to insertion. Suppositories or foams do not have advantages over ointments, creams, and gels."
Local anesthetics,"'Local anesthetics temporarily relieve ''pain'', burning, and itching by numbing the nerve endings. The use of these products should be limited to the perianal area and lower anal canal. Local anesthetics can cause ''allergic'' reactions with burning and itching. Therefore, the application of anesthetics should be discontinued if burning and itching increase.''Examples of local anesthetics include:' benzocaine 5% to 20% (Americaine Hemorrhoidal, Lanacane Maximum Strength, Medicone) benzyl alcohol (Itch-X) 5% to 20% dibucaine 0.25% to 1.0% (Nupercainal) dyclonine 0.5% to 1.0% lidocaine (Xylocaine) 2% to 5% pramoxine 1.0% (Fleet Pain-Relief, Procto Foam Non-steroid, Tronothane Hydrochloride) tetracaine 0.5% to 5.0%"
Vasoconstrictors,"'Vasoconstrictors are chemicals such as epinephrine, a naturally occurring chemical. Applied to the anus, vasoconstrictors make the blood vessels become smaller, which may reduce swelling. They also may reduce symptoms due to their mild anesthetic effect.''Vasoconstrictors applied to the perianal area -- unlike vasoconstrictors given by injection -- have a low likelihood of causing serious side effects, such as ''high blood pressure'', nervousness, ''tremor'', ''sleeplessness'', and aggravation of ''diabetes'' or ''hyperthyroidism''.''Examples of vasoconstrictors include:' ephedrine sulfate 0.1% to 1.25% epinephrine 0.005% to 0.01% phenylephrine 0.25% (Medicone Suppository, Preparation H, Rectocaine)"
Protectants,"'Protectants prevent irritation of the perianal area by forming a physical barrier on the skin that prevents contact of the irritated skin with aggravating liquid or stool from the rectum. This barrier reduces irritation, itching, pain, and burning. There are many products that are themselves protectants or that contain a protectant in addition to other medications.''Examples of protectants include:' aluminum hydroxide gel cocoa butter glycerin kaolin lanolin mineral oil (Balneol) white petrolatum starch zinc oxide (Desitin) or calamine (which contains zinc oxide) in concentrations of up to 25% cod liver oil or shark liver oil if the amount of vitamin A is 10,000 USP units/day."
Astringents,"'Astringents cause coagulation (clumping) of proteins in the cells of the perianal skin or the lining of the anal canal. This action promotes dryness of the skin, which in turn helps relieve burning, itching, and pain.''Examples of astringents include:' calamine 5% to 25% zinc oxide 5% to 25% (Calmol 4, Nupercainal, Tronolane) witch hazel 10% to 50% (Fleet Medicated, Tucks, Witch Hazel Hemorrhoidal Pads)"
Antiseptics,"'Antiseptics inhibit the growth of bacteria and other organisms. However, it is unclear whether antiseptics are any more effective than soap and water.''Examples of antiseptics include:' boric acid phenol benzalkonium chloride cetylpyridinium chloride benzethonium chloride resorcinol"
Keratolytics,'Keratolytics are chemicals that cause the outer layers of skin or other tissues to disintegrate. The rationale for their use is that the disintegration allows medications that are applied to the anus and perianal area to penetrate into the deeper tissues.''The two approved keratolytics used are:' aluminum chlorhydroxy allantoinate (alcloxa) 0.2% to 2.0% resorcinol 1% to 3%
Analgesics,"'Analgesic products, like anesthetic products, relieve pain, itching, and burning by depressing receptors on pain nerves.''Examples of analgesics include:' menthol 0.1% to 1.0% (greater than 1.0% is not recommended) (Calmoseptine) camphor 0.1% to 3% (greater than 3% is not recommended) juniper tar 1% to 5%"
Corticosteroids,"'Corticosteroids'' reduce inflammation and can relieve itching, but their chronic use can cause permanent damage to the skin. They should not be used for more than short periods of a few days to two weeks. Only products with weak ''corticosteroid'' effects are available over-the-counter. Stronger corticosteroid products that are available by prescription should not be used for treating anal itching.' "
What if anal itching persists?,"'For persistent anal itching, efforts are directed toward identifying an underlying cause. An examination by a doctor can rapidly identify most causes of anal itching. Adjustments in ''diet'', treatment of infections, or surgical procedures to correct the underlying cause may be required.' "
What should I know about anal fissures?,"'An anal fissure is a cut or tear occurring in the anus (the opening through which ''stool'' passes out of the body) that extends upwards into the anal canal. Fissures are a common condition of the anus and anal canal and are responsible for 6% to 15% of the visits to a colon and rectal (''colorectal'') surgeon. They affect men and women equally and both the young and the old. Fissures usually cause ''pain'' during bowel movements that often is severe. Anal fissure is the most common cause of ''rectal bleeding'' in infancy.''Anal fissures occur in the specialized tissue that lines the anus and anal canal, called anoderm. At a line just inside the anus (referred to as the anal verge or intersphincteric groove) the skin (dermis) of the inner buttocks changes to anoderm. Unlike skin, anoderm has no hairs, sweat glands, or sebaceous (oil) glands and contains a larger number of sensory nerves that sense light touch and ''pain''. (The abundance of nerves explains why anal fissures are so painful.) The hairless, gland-less, extremely sensitive anoderm continues for the entire length of the anal canal until it meets the demarcating line for the rectum, called the dentate line. (The rectum is the distal 15 cm of the colon that lies just above the anal canal and just below the sigmoid colon.)''Anal fissures are caused primarily by ''trauma'', but several non-traumatic diseases are associated with anal fissures and should be suspected if fissures occur in unusual locations.''Anal fissures are diagnosed and evaluated by visual inspection of the anus and anal canal.''Anal fissures are initially treated conservatively with home remedies and OTC products that include adding bulk to the ''stool'', softening the stool, consuming a high ''fiber'' ''diet'', and utilizing sitz baths.''Prescription ''drugs'' used to treat anal fissures that fail to heal with less conservative treatment are ointments containing anesthetics, steroids, ''nitroglycerin'', and calcium channel blocking drugs (''CCBs'').''Surgery by lateral sphincterotomy is the gold standard for curing anal fissures. Because of complications, however, it is reserved for patients who are intolerant of non-surgical treatments or in whom non-surgical treatments have proven to be ineffective.' The primary symptom of anal fissures is pain during and following bowel movements. Other symptoms that may occur are bleeding, itching, and a malodorous discharge."
What are the signs and symptoms of anal fissures?,"'People with anal fissures almost always experience anal pain that worsens with bowel movements.''As previously mentioned, anal fissures commonly bleed in infants.'   The pain following a bowel movement may be brief or long lasting; however, the pain usually subsides between bowel movements. The pain can be so severe that patients are unwilling to have a bowel movement, resulting in constipation and even fecal impaction. Moreover, constipation can result in the passage of a larger, harder stool that causes further trauma and makes the fissure worse. The pain also can affect urination by causing discomfort when urinating (dysuria), frequent urination, or the inability to urinate. Bleeding in small amounts, itching (pruritus ani), and a malodorous discharge may occur due to the discharge of pus from the fissure."
What causes anal fissures?,"'Anal fissures are caused by trauma to the anus and anal canal. The cause of the trauma usually is a bowel movement, and many people can remember the exact bowel movement during which their pain began. The fissure may be caused by a hard stool or repeated episodes of ''diarrhea''. Occasionally, the insertion of a rectal thermometer, enema tip, endoscope, or ''ultrasound'' probe (for examining the ''prostate gland'') can result in sufficient trauma to produce a fissure. During ''childbirth'', trauma to the perineum (the skin between the posterior vagina and the anus) may cause a tear that extends into the anoderm.''The most common location for an anal fissure in both men and women (90% of all fissures) is the midline posteriorly in the anal canal, the part of the anus nearest the spine. Fissures are more common posteriorly because of the configuration of the muscle that surrounds the anus. This muscle complex, referred to as the external and internal anal sphincters, underlies and supports the anal canal. The sphincters are oval-shaped and are best supported at their sides and weakest posteriorly. When tears occur in the anoderm, therefore, they are more likely to be posterior. In women, there also is weak support for the anterior anal canal due to the presence of the vagina anterior to the anus. For this reason, 10% of fissures in women are anterior, while only 1% are anterior in men. At the lower end of fissures a tag of skin may form, called a sentinel pile.''When fissures occur in locations other than the midline posteriorly or anteriorly, they should raise the suspicion that a problem other than trauma is the cause. Other causes of fissures are ''anal cancer'"", Crohn's disease, ""'leukemia'' as well as many infectious diseases including ''tuberculosis'', viral infections (''cytomegalovirus'' or ''herpes''), ''syphilis'', ''gonorrhea'', ''Chlamydia'' , ''chancroid'' (''Hemophilus ducreyi''), and ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'""). Among patients with Crohn's disease, 4% will have an anal fissure as the first manifestation of their Crohn's disease, and half of all patients with Crohn's disease eventually will develop an anal ulceration that may look like a fissure.""'Studies of the anal canal in patients with anal fissures consistently show that the muscles surrounding the anal canal are contracting too strongly (they are in spasm), thereby generating a pressure in the canal that is abnormally high. The two muscles that surround the anal canal are the external anal sphincter and the internal anal sphincter (already discussed). The external anal sphincter is a voluntary (striated) muscle, that is, it can be controlled consciously. Thus, when we need to have a bowel movement we can either tighten the external sphincter and prevent the bowel movement, or we can relax it and allow the bowel movement. On the other hand, the internal anal sphincter is an involuntary (smooth) muscle, that is, a muscle we cannot control. The internal sphincter is constantly contracted and normally prevents small amounts of stool from leaking from the rectum. When a substantial load of stool reaches the rectum, as it does just prior to a bowel movement, the internal anal sphincter relaxes automatically to let the stool pass (that is, unless the external anal sphincter is consciously tightened).''When an anal fissure is present, the internal anal sphincter is in spasm. In addition, after the sphincter finally does relax to allow a bowel movement to pass, instead of going back to its resting level of contraction and pressure, the internal anal sphincter contracts even more vigorously for a few seconds before it goes back to its elevated resting level of contraction. It is thought that the high resting pressure and the ""overshoot"" contraction of the internal anal sphincter following a bowel movement pull the edges of the fissure apart and prevent the fissure from healing.''The supply of blood to the anus and anal canal also may play a role in the poor healing of anal fissures. Anatomic and microscopic studies of the anal canal on cadavers found that in 85% of individuals that the posterior part of the anal canal (where most fissures occur) has less blood flowing to it than the other parts of the anal canal. Moreover, ultrasound studies that measure the flow of blood showed that the posterior anal canal had less than half of the blood flow of other parts of the canal. This relatively poor flow of blood may be a factor in preventing fissures from healing. It also is possible that the increased pressure in the anal canal due to spasm of the internal anal sphincter may compress the blood vessels of the anal canal and further reduce the flow of blood.'  "
"What exams, procedures, and tests diagnose anal fissures?","'A careful history usually suggests that an anal fissure is present, and gentle inspection of the anus can confirm the presence of a fissure. If gentle eversion (pulling apart) the edges of the anus by separating the buttocks does not reveal a fissure, a more vigorous examination following the application of a topical anesthetic to the anus and anal canal may be necessary. A cotton-tipped swab may be inserted into the anus to gently localize the source of the pain.''An acute anal fissure looks like a linear tear. A chronic anal fissure frequently is associated with a triad of findings that includes a tag of skin at the edge of the anus (sentinel pile), thickened edges of the fissure with muscle fibers of the internal sphincter visible at the base of the fissure, and an enlarged anal papilla at the upper end of the fissure in the anal canal.''If ''rectal bleeding'' is present, an endoscopic evaluation using a rigid or flexible viewing tube is necessary to exclude the possibility of a more serious disease of the anus and rectum. A ''sigmoidoscopy'' that examines only the distal part of the colon may be reasonable in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a typical anal fissure. In patients with a family history of ''colon cancer'' or age greater than 50 (and, therefore, at higher risk for colon ''cancer''), a ''colonoscopy'' that examines the entire colon is recommended. Atypical fissures that suggest the presence of other diseases, as discussed previously, require other diagnostic studies including colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small intestinal ''X-rays''.'  "
What home remedies and over-the-counter drugs treat anal fissures?,"'The goal of treatment for anal fissures is to break the cycle of spasm of the anal sphincter and its repeated tearing of the anoderm. In acute fissures, medical (nonoperative) therapy is successful in the majority of patients. Of acute fissures, 80% to 90% will heal with conservative measures as compared with chronic (recurrent) fissures, which show only a 40% rate of healing. Initial treatment involves adding bulk to the stool and softening the stool with psyllium or methylcellulose preparations and a high fiber ''diet''.''Other home remedies for anal fisures include avoiding ""sharp"" foods that may not be well-digested (i.e., nuts, popcorn, tortilla chips); increase liquid intake, and, at times, take stool softeners (''docusate'' or mineral oil preparations). Sitz baths (essentially soaking in a tub of warm water). Sitz baths are encouraged, particularly after bowel movements, to relax the spasm, to increase the flow of blood to the anus, and to clean the anus without rubbing the irritated anoderm.''The author has found that when there are enlarged internal ''hemorrhoids'' in addition to a fissure, that healing of the fissure is improved if the ''hemorrhoids'' are treated with ''sclerotherapy'' that shrinks them. After application of a topical anesthetic, if a patient can tolerate a gentle examination of the rectum with a finger and an anoscope can be inserted through the anus, enlarged ''hemorrhoids'' can be identified, and if present, treated with sclerotherapy. (It is unclear if improvement in healing is caused by anal dilation with the finger or by shrinkage of the ''hemorrhoid''.)'  "
What prescription drugs treat anal fissures?,"'Topical anesthetics (for example, ''xylocaine'', ''lidocaine'', tetracaine, ''pramoxine'') are recommended especially prior to a bowel movement to reduce the pain of defecation. Often, a small amount of a steroid is combined in the anesthetic cream to reduce inflammation. The use of steroids should be limited to two weeks because longer use will result in thinning of the anoderm (atrophy), which makes it more susceptible to trauma. Oral medications to relax the smooth muscle of the internal sphincter have not been shown to aid healing.''Because of the possibility that spasm of the internal sphincter and reduced flow of blood to the sphincter play roles in the formation and healing of anal fissures, ointments with the muscle relaxant, nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), have been tried and found to be effective in healing anal fissures. ''Glycerin'' trinitrate (nitroglycerin) has been shown to cause relaxation of the internal anal sphincter and to decrease the anal resting pressure. When ointments containing nitroglycerin are applied to the anal canal, the nitroglycerin diffuses across the anoderm and relaxes the internal sphincter and reduces the pressure in the anal canal. This relieves spasm of the muscle and also may increase the flow of blood, both of which promote healing of fissures. Unlike Nitropaste, a 2.0% concentration of nitroglycerin that is used on the skin for patients with ''heart disease'' and ''angina'', the nitroglycerin ointment used for treating anal fissures contains a concentration of nitroglycerin of only 0.2%. One randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated the healing of anal fissures in 68% of patients with nitroglycerin as compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo (inactive treatment). Other studies have shown a 33% to 47% recurrence rate of fissures following treatment with nitroglycerin. The presence of a sentinel pile is associated with a lower healing rate with nitroglycerin treatment.''The dose of nitroglycerin often is limited by side effects. The usual side effects are ''headache'' (due to dilation of blood vessels in the head) or light-headedness (due to a drop in ''blood pressure''). This author recommends that a small amount of ointment be applied to a cotton-tipped swab with the swab then inserted into the anus only for the depth of the cotton-tipped portion of the swab. Ointment smeared only around the outside of the anus does not reach the anoderm where its effects are important, yet the nitroglycerin will be absorbed and produce side effects.''Nitroglycerin is more rapidly absorbed if blood flow in the anoderm is high. For this reason, it is recommended that nitroglycerin not be applied within 30 minutes of a bath since the warm water of the bath enlarges (dilates) the blood vessels in the skin and anoderm and increases their flow of blood. Additionally, the first application of nitroglycerin should be at bedtime while the patient is lying down in order to prevent falls due to light-headedness.''The side effects of nitroglycerin often are self-limited, that is, they become less with repeated use. ''Caffeine'' can help reduce or prevent ''headaches''. However, if side effects are pronounced, nitroglycerin should be discontinued. Drugs for ''impotence'' (for example, ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), should not be used together with nitroglycerin since they increase the risk of developing ''low blood pressure''.''As is the case with nitroglycerin, ointments containing calcium channel blocking drugs (for example, ''nifedipine'' [Adalat] or ''diltiazem'' [''Cardizem'']) relax the muscles of the internal sphincter. They also expand the blood vessels of the anoderm and increase the flow of blood. Nifedipine ointment (2%) is applied in a manner similar to nitroglycerin ointment, but seems to produce fewer side effects. Although healing of chronic fissures has been reported in up to 67% of patients treated with ''calcium channel blockers'', they are most effective with acute fissures.''Botulinum toxin (''Botox'') relaxes (actually paralyzes) muscles by preventing the release of acetylcholine from the nerves that normally causes muscle cells to contract. It has been used successfully to treat a variety of disorders in which there is spasm of muscles, including anal fissures. The toxin is injected into the external sphincter, the internal sphincter, the intersphincteric groove (an indentation just inside the anus that demarcates the dividing line between external and internal sphincters), or into the fissure itself. The dose is not standardized and has varied from 2.5 to 20 units of toxin in two locations (usually on either side of the fissure). The cost of a 100-unit vial of toxin is several hundred dollars and unused toxin cannot be saved. Thus, the expense for a single injection of toxin is high. In some series of patients but not all, the frequency of healing of fissures with botulinum toxin is high. When fissures recur after treatment, they usually heal again with a second injection. One representative study found that fissures healed in 87% of patients by six months after treatment with botulinum toxin. By 12 months, however, the healing rate had fallen to 75% and by 42 months to 60%. The primary side effect of botulinum toxin is ''weakness'' of the sphincters with varying degrees of ''incontinence'' (leakage of stool) that usually is transient. Other side effects are not common.''There is a great variability in the medical literature with respect to the effectiveness of drugs and botulinum toxin in the healing of anal fissures. Healing may be temporary and fissures may return with a hard bowel movement. Recurrent fissures often require a change to another form of treatment. Patients need to balance the effectiveness of treatment, short and long-term side effects, convenience, and expense in choosing their treatment. When patients are intolerant or unresponsive to non-surgical treatments, surgery becomes necessary.' "
Does surgery cure anal fissures?,"'The Standard Task Force of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons has recommended a surgical procedure called partial lateral internal sphincterotomy as the technique of choice for the treatment of anal fissures. In this procedure, the internal anal sphincter is cut starting at its distal most end at the anal verge and extending into the anal canal for a distance equal to that of the fissure. The cut may extend to the dentate line, but not farther. The sphincter can be divided in a closed (percutaneous) fashion by tunneling under the anoderm or in an open fashion by cutting through the anoderm. The cut is made on the left or right side of the anus, hence the name ""partial lateral internal sphincterotomy."" The posterior midline, where the fissure usually is located, is avoided for fear of accentuating the posterior weakness of the muscle surrounding the anal canal. (Additional weakness posteriorly can lead to what is called a keyhole deformity, so called because the resulting anal canal resembles an old fashioned skeleton key. This deformity promotes soilage and leakage of stool.)''Although many surgeons decline to cut out the fissure itself during lateral sphincterotomy, this author feels that this reluctance to remove the fissure is not always appropriate, and characteristics of the fissure itself should be taken into account. If the fissure is hard and irregular, suggesting ''anal cancer'', the fissure should be biopsied. If the edges and base of the fissure are heavily scarred, there may be a problem after surgery with anal stenosis, a condition in which additional scarring narrows the anal canal and interferes with the passage of stool. In this case, it may be better to cut out the scarred fissure so that there is a chance for the ''wound'' to heal with less scarring and chance of stenosis. Finally, an associated large anal papilla or a large hemorrhoidal tag may interfere physically with wound healing, and removing them may promote healing.''Following surgery, 93% to 97% of fissures heal. In one representative study, healing following surgery occurred in 98% of patients by two months. At 42 months following surgery, 94% of patients were still healed. Recurrence rates after this type of surgery are low, 0% to 3%.'""Failure to heal following surgery often is attributed to reluctance on the part of the surgeon to adequately divide the internal anal sphincter; however, other reasons for failure to heal, such as Crohn's disease should be considered as well. The risk of incontinence (leakage) of stool following surgery is low. It is important to distinguish between short-term and long-term incontinence. In the short-term (under six weeks), the sphincter is weakened by the surgery, so leakage of stool is not unexpected. Long-term incontinence should not occur after partial lateral internal sphincterotomy because the internal sphincter is less important than the external sphincter (which is not cut) in controlling the passage of stool. It is important to distinguish between incontinence to ""'gas'', a minimal amount of stool that, at most, stains the underwear (soiling), and loss of stool that requires an immediate change in underwear. In a large series of patients followed for a mean of five years after surgery, 6% were ''incontinent'' of gas, 8% had minor soiling, and 1% experienced loss of stool.''Several surgeons have described procedures that stretch and tear the anal sphincters for the treatment of anal fissures. Though anal stretching often is successful in alleviating pain and healing the fissure, it is a traumatic, uncontrolled disruption of the sphincter. Ultrasonograms of the anal sphincters following stretching demonstrate trauma that extends beyond the desired area. Because only 72% of fissures heal and there is a 20% incidence of incontinence of stool, stretching has fallen out of favor.' "
What is a urinalysis?,"""A urinalysis is simply an analysis of the urine. It is a very common test that can be performed in many health care settings, including doctors' offices, urgent care facilities, laboratories, hospitals, and even at home.""'A urinalysis test is performed by collecting a urine sample from the patient in a specimen cup. Usually only small amounts (30-60 mL) may be required for urinalysis testing. The sample can be either analyzed in the medical clinic or sent to a laboratory to perform the tests. Urinalysis is abbreviated UA.''UA is in general easily available and relatively inexpensive. It is also a simple test and can provide many useful information about various diseases and conditions. Some physicians refer to urinalysis as ""a poor man\'s kidney biopsy"" because of the plethora of information that can be obtained about the health of the kidney or other internal diseases by this simple test.''Urine can be evaluated by its physical appearance (color, cloudiness, odor, clarity), also referred to as a macroscopic analysis. It can be also analyzed based on its chemical and molecular properties, including microscopic assessment.''Urinalysis is ordered by doctors for a number of reasons, including the following:'   Routine medical evaluation: general yearly screening, assessment before surgery (preoperative assessment), admission to hospital, screening for kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (high blood pressure), liver disease, etc. Assessing particular symptoms: abdominal pain, painful urination, flank pain, fever, blood in the urine (hematuria), or other urinary symptoms. Diagnosing medical conditions: urinary tract infections, kidney stones, uncontrolled diabetes (high blood sugars), kidney impairment, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), protein in urine (proteinuria), drug screening, and kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Monitoring disease progression and response to therapy: diabetes related kidney disease, kidney impairment, lupus related kidney disease, blood pressure related kidney disease, kidney infection, proteinuria, and hematuria Pregnancy testing"
What can urinalysis results show?,"'Urinalysis can disclose evidence of diseases, even some that have not caused significant signs or symptoms. Therefore, a urinalysis is commonly a part of routine health screening.''Urinalysis is commonly used to diagnose a urinary tract or kidney infection, to evaluate causes of ''kidney failure'', to screen for progression of some chronic conditions such as ''diabetes'' mellitus and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''It also may be used in combination with other tests to diagnose some diseases. Additional tests and clinical assessment are often required to further investigate findings of urinalysis and ultimately diagnose the causes or specific features of underlying problems. For example, urine infection is generally diagnosed based on results of urinalysis. However, urine culture is often ordered as a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the bacteria that may be causing the infection. Other examples include kidney stones, inflammation or the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).'  "
Who is involved in the interpretation of urinalysis?,'Interpretation of urinalysis is generally based on reviewing all the components of the test and correlating it with the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient and the physical examination. The results are reviewed and interpreted by the doctor who ordered the test.' 
What types of doctors perform urinalysis?,"'Many types of doctors may order a urinalysis in their practice. Because of easy availability, relatively nominal cost, simplicity of performing the test, and quick turnaround time, UA is done in many settings by variety of doctors. Most frequently, UA is ordered by internists, family practitioners, emergency-room physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, nephrologists (kidney specialists), urologists, ''rheumatologists'', and possibly less often by many other specialists.' "
What does urinalysis involve?,"'Urinalysis is done by collecting a urine sample from a patient. The optimal sample tends to be an early morning urine sample because it is frequently the most concentrated urine produced in the day. Typically, no fasting is required before the collection of urine sample and routine medications can be taken before the test, unless otherwise instructed by the ordering physician.''Methods of collection are slightly different for female and male patient.''The collected urine sample should be taken to the laboratory for analysis, typically within one hour of collection. If transportation to the lab could take more than one hour, then the sample may be refrigerated.''In some patients who are unable to void spontaneously or those who are not able to follow instructions other methods may be used, such as placing a catheter (a small rubber tube) through the outside opening to the bladder (urethra) to collect the sample directly from the bladder.' For females, the patient is asked to clean the area around the urethra with a special cleansing wipe, by spreading the labia of the external genitals and cleaning from front to back (toward the anus). The cleaning hand is then used to maintain the spread while the cup is held by the other hand to collect the sample. For men, the tip of the penis may be wiped with a cleansing pad prior to collection. The urine is then collected in a clean urine specimen cup while the patient is urinating. It is best to avoid collecting the initial stream of urine. After the initial part of urine is disposed of in the toilet, then the urine is collected in the urine container provided. Once about 30 mL to 60 mL (roughly 3 to 5 tablespoons) are collected in the container for testing, the remainder of the urine may be voided in the toilet again. This is called the midstream clean catch urine collection."
What is macroscopic urinalysis?,"'Macroscopic urinalysis is the direct visual observation of the urine, noting its quantity, color, clarity or cloudiness, etc.''Normal urine is typically light yellow and clear without any cloudiness. Obvious abnormalities in the color, clarity, and cloudiness may suggest possibility of''Certain medications may also change the color of urine (for example, ''phenazopyridine'', a urinary antiseptic and ''pain reliever''). Very foamy urine may represent large amounts of ''protein in the urine'' (proteinuria).' an infection (cloudy urine), dehydration (dark urine color), liver disease (""bilirubin,"" a digestive substance secreted by the liver, stains urine a tea or cola color), blood in the urine (hematuria -- visible to the eye may indicate urinary tract infection, stones, tumors, or injuries), or breakdown of muscle (orange- or tea-colored urine)."
What is urine test strip chemical analysis?,"'Urine test strip\xa0is a narrow ''plastic'' strip which has several squares of different colors attached to it. Each small square represents a component of the test used to interpret urinalysis. The entire test strip is dipped in the urine sample and color changes in each square are noted. The color change takes place after several seconds to a few minutes from dipping the strip. If read too early or too long after the urinalysis strip is dipped, the results may not be accurate.''Each color change on a particular square may indicate specific abnormalities in the urine sample caused by a certain chemical reaction. The reference for color changes is posted on the plastic bottle container of the urine test strips. This makes for easy and quick interpretation of the urinalysis results by placing the strip next to the container and comparing its color changes to the reference provided.''The squares on the dipstick represent the following components in the urine:''Presence or absence of each of these color changes on the strip provides important information for clinical decisions.''After the dipstick test strip is dipped in urine briefly and completely, the reading is done within a few minutes. Each one of the squares on the box has next to it the time which is recommended for its interpretation (for example, whether these is a change in color on the square). The squares are placed in similar order on the box, from the ones requiring the shortest time to read of 30 seconds to the ones with the longest time to read of two minutes. This arrangement is based on result time and makes it easier to quickly read and interpret any color changes by simply scanning the strip from the shortest (glucose) to the longest (leukocytes).' Specific gravity (concentration of urine) Acidity of the urine (pH levels) Protein in the urine (proteinuria), mainly albumin Glucose (sugar) in the urine (glycosuria) Ketones in the urine (ketonuria), products of fat metabolism Hemoglobin/blood in the urine (hematuria) Leukocyte esterase (suggestive of white blood cells in urine) Nitrite (suggestive of bacteria in urine) Bilirubin (possible liver disease or red blood cell breakdown) Urobilinogen (possible liver disease or etodolac [Lodine] medication)"
What are the pros and cons of urine test strip?,"""The main advantage of a urine test strip is that they are convenient, easy to interpret, and cost-effective. They can be analyzed within minutes of urine collection in the doctor's office or in the emergency room to provide valuable information.""'However, what can be learned from a dipstick is limited by the design of the dipstick. The main disadvantage is that the information may not be very accurate, as the test is time-sensitive. It also provides limited information about the urine, as it is qualitative test and not a quantitative test (for example, it does not give a precise measure of the quantity of abnormality). Therefore, normal and abnormal values are not reported as part of urinalysis results.' "
What is microscopic urinalysis?,"'The microscopic urinalysis is the study of the urine sample under a microscope. It requires only a relatively inexpensive light microscope. Cells and cellular debris, bacteria, and crystals in the urine (crystalluria) can be detected by microscopic examination to provide confirmation of the dipstick color change (see above) and further clinical clues.' "
How is microscopic urinalysis done?,"'Microscopic urinalysis is done simply pouring the urine sample into a test tube and centrifuging it (spinning it down in a machine) for a few minutes. The top liquid part (the supernatant) is discarded. The solid part left in the bottom of the test tube (the urine sediment) is mixed with the remaining drop of urine in the test tube and one drop is analyzed under a microscope.''The sediment is examined through the microscope under low-power to identify what are called casts, crystals, squamous (flat) cells, and other large objects.''Examination is then performed through the microscope at higher power to further identify any cells, bacteria and clumps of cells or debris called casts.' "
What kind of cells can be detected?,"'Epithelial cells (flat cells), red and white blood cells may be seen in the urine.''Sometimes cells, cellular debris, and casts are seen in the microscopic exam. Epithelial cells (cells in the lining of the bladder or urethra) may suggest inflammation within the bladder, but they also may originate from the skin and could be contamination.''Casts and cellular debris originate from higher up in the urinary tract, such as in the kidneys. These are material shed from kidney cell lining due to injury or inflammation and travel down through the urinary tubes. These usually suggest an injury to the kidney from an inflammation or lack of blood flow to the kidneys. Rarely, ''tumor'' cells can be in the urine suggesting a urinary tract ''cancer''.' "
What can the presence of red blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Red blood cells'' can enter the urine from the vagina in ''menstruation'' or from the ''trauma'' of bladder catheterization.''A high count of red blood cells in the urine can indicate infection, trauma, tumors, or kidney stones. If red blood cells seen under microscopy look distorted, they suggest kidney as the possible source and may arise due to kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Small amounts of red blood cells in the urine are sometimes seen young healthy people and usually are not indicative of any disease.' "
What can the presence of white blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Urine is a generally thought of as a sterile body fluid, therefore, evidence of white blood cells or bacteria in the urine is considered abnormal and may suggest a ''urinary tract infection'' such as, ''bladder infection'' (''cystitis''), infection of kidney (''pyelonephritis''). White blood cells (WBC) may be detected in the urine through a microscopic examination (pyuria or leukocytes in the blood). They can be seen under high power field and the number of cells are recorded (quantitative) as ""rare, few, moderate, or many.""''White cells from the vagina or the opening of the urethra (in males, too) can contaminate a urine sample. Such contamination aside, the presence of abnormal numbers of white blood cells in the urine is significant.' "
"Other than urinalysis, what are other common urine tests available?","'Other commonly performed urine tests are drug tests, ''pregnancy tests'', specific chemicals and proteins in the body, which are not a part of routine urinalysis.''Urine drug screen is done routinely to check for ''drugs'' or their byproducts in the urine. There are many purposes for these tests including athletic screening, emergency rooms settings, drug detoxification programs, school and employment screening. This test detects the presence of commonly used drugs such as''Urine ''pregnancy test'' is very common and it measures a hormone in the urine associated with pregnancy (beta-HCG or beta- human chorionic gonadotropin). This test can be done in medical settings, but numerous kits are available for home use.''Other urine tests can also be used in evaluation of many medical conditions. Examples include' cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, marijuana, phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and opiates. urine culture (in determining the bacterial cause of urine infection), urine creatinine (in assessing kidney disease), urine total protein and albumin (in assessing kidney disease and protein loss from kidney), urine cytology (in evaluating for possible bladder or other urinary tumors), urine calcium (in evaluating elevated blood calcium levels), 24-hour urine collection for proteins (in diagnosing causes of kidney impairment, diabetic related kidney disease, lupus related kidney disease), 24-hour urine collection for protein electrophoresis (for measuring different components of proteins in urine in evaluating multiple myeloma, kidney inflammation with increased protein loss), or 24-hour urine collection of catecholamine metabolites (in evaluating adrenal gland disease, difficult to treat high blood pressure)."
What is anaphylaxis?,"'Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing and serious allergic reaction that can affect multiple body systems at the same time. Severe anaphylactic reactions can be fatal. Anaphylaxis is often triggered by substances to which people have an allergy that are injected or ingested and thereby gain access into the bloodstream. This can result in a reaction involving the skin, ''lungs'', nose, throat, and gastrointestinal tract and can culminate in life-threatening anaphylactic shock.' "
What is the history of anaphylaxis?,"""To fully understand this term, we need to go back almost 100 years. The story begins on a cruise aboard Prince Albert I of Monaco's yacht. The prince had invited two Parisian scientists to perform studies on the toxin produced by the tentacles of a local jellyfish, the Portuguese Man of War. Charles Richet and Paul Portier were able to isolate the toxin and tried to vaccinate ""'dogs'' in the hope of obtaining protection, or ""prophylaxis,"" against the toxin. They were horrified to find that subsequent very small doses of the toxin unexpectedly resulted in a new dramatic illness that involved the rapid onset of ''breathing'' difficulty and resulted in death within 30 minutes. Richet and Portier termed this ""anaphylaxis"" or ""against protection."" They rightly concluded that the immune system first becomes sensitized to the ''allergen'' over several weeks and upon reexposure to the same allergen may result in a severe reaction. An allergen is a substance that is foreign to the body and can cause an allergic reaction in certain people.''Richet went on to suggest that the allergen must result in the production of a substance, which then sensitized the dogs to react in such a way upon reexposure. This substance turned out to be IgE.' The first documented case of presumed anaphylaxis occurred in 2641 BC when Menes, an Egyptian pharaoh, died mysteriously following a wasp or hornet sting. Later, in Babylonian times, there are two distinct references to deaths due to wasp stings. Charles Richet was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1913 for his work on anaphylaxis."
What are common causes of anaphylaxis?,"'The major causes of allergy and anaphylaxis include medications, foods, drugs, latex, and ''insect bites'' or stings (wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, honeybees, and fire ants), and latex. The causes of anaphylaxis are divided into two major groups:''IgE-mediated or immunologic anaphylaxis'': This form requires an initial sensitizing exposure (an exposure to the substance that will later trigger the anaphylaxis) and then occurs on a subsequent exposure. It involves the coating of mast cells and basophils (cells in the blood and tissue that secrete mediators, the substances that cause allergic reactions) by an antibody called IgE, and the subsequent release of chemical mediators upon re-exposure. IgE-mediated anaphylaxis can occur with ''food allergies'' or ''allergies'' to drugs, latex, and ''insect stings''. ''Food allergy'' is estimated to cause up to half of emergency department visits for anaphylaxis in developed countries. Although it may appear that IgE-mediated anaphylaxis occurs upon a first exposure to a food, drug, or ''insect sting'', there must have been a prior sensitization from a previous exposure, which is often unknown. One may not remember an uneventful sting. The previous exposure to a food may not be recalled; it may occur in utero, through ''breast milk'', or through the skin, particularly in individuals with ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'').''Non-IgE-mediated or nonimmunologic anaphylaxis'': These reactions have the same symptoms as true anaphylaxis but do not require an IgE immune reaction. They are usually caused by the direct stimulation of the mast cells and basophils. In the past, they have been termed ""anaphylactoid reactions."" The same mediators are released as with IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and the same effects are produced. This reaction can happen on initial, as well as subsequent, exposures, since no sensitization is required. This type of reaction usually occurs with medications. A common cause of a non-IgE-mediated reaction is IV contrast used in imaging studies.'  "
What are anaphylaxis symptoms and signs?,"'Anaphylaxis often affects two or more body systems, or it may present with just ''low blood pressure'' (''hypotension''), which usually occurs with a severe reaction. Although the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction usually occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to a trigger, some reactions can occur up to two hours after the exposure. Possible symptoms and signs of an anaphylactic reaction include:''Skin symptoms'': ''itching'', flushing, hives, and swelling (''angioedema'')''Gastrointestinal symptoms'': ''abdominal pain'', abdominal cramping, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''Respiratory symptoms'': ''nasal congestion'', ''runny nose'', ''cough'', ''shortness of breath'', ''chest tightness'', and ''wheezing''Cardiovascular symptoms'': ''dizziness'', ''lightheadedness'', fast ''heart'' rate (tachycardia), and ''low blood pressure''Additionally, those affected often report a ""feeling of impending doom.""''There is no testing to predict the severity of an anaphylactic reaction, though a previous severe reaction raises the risk of a subsequent severe reaction. Uncontrolled ''asthma'' is a consistent risk factor for severe anaphylaxis and fatal anaphylaxis. A history of environmental ''allergies'', ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis''), or ''asthma'' may also raise the risk of anaphylaxis.'  "
Are there any disorders that appear similar to anaphylaxis?,"'Several disorders may appear similar to anaphylaxis. ''Fainting'' (''vasovagal'' reaction) is the reaction that is most likely to be confused with anaphylaxis. The key differences are that in a ''fainting'' episode, the affected person typically has a slow pulse, cool and ''pale skin'', and no hives or difficulty breathing. Other conditions, such as ''heart attacks'', ''blood clots'' to the lungs (pulmonary embolus), ''septic shock'', and ''panic attacks'' can also be confused with anaphylaxis.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose anaphylaxis?,"'Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis and is usually diagnosed by the patterns of symptoms listed above. If someone thinks he or she is having an anaphylactic reaction, the first and most important step is to treat with self-injectable epinephrine and/or seek emergency care. Once the acute reaction has been treated with epinephrine, one must seek urgent medical care to monitor for the risk of a biphasic reaction. Referral to an allergist is also typically recommended. The allergist will assess whether or not the reaction was indeed allergic in nature. Sometimes, a careful and detailed medical history and selected blood or skin tests can identify the trigger. The medical history focuses on exposures such as foods, medications, and stings preceding the anaphylactic reaction. In rare cases, ''exercise'' or ''alcohol'' may be a factor in anaphylaxis.''Exercise''-induced anaphylaxis'': Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a rare condition that presents with the same symptoms as anaphylaxis but is triggered by exercise. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is often food-dependent in which symptoms occur with exercise only after consuming specific foods, such as celery, wheat, alcohol, or shellfish. Early symptoms are usually flushing and ''itching'', which may progress to other typical symptoms of anaphylaxis if the exercise continues. Premedication with ''antihistamines'' or other drugs does not consistently prevent EIA. Warming up slowly, avoiding eating two to four hours before exercise, exercising with a partner, and carrying emergency epinephrine kits is mandatory for those at risk for exercise-induced anaphylaxis. If symptoms occur despite these measures, then exercise avoidance may be recommended.''When no cause can be found for anaphylaxis, it is termed idiopathic. Recent reports suggest that 25% of all episodes of anaphylaxis are idiopathic. For frequent episodes of anaphylaxis, a physician may recommend a combination of ''antihistamine'', leukotriene inhibitors, or oral steroids to reduce the severity of attacks. There is also some evidence that a biologic medication, ''omalizumab'' (''Xolair''), which binds IgE, may help with idiopathic anaphylaxis.'  "
Recommendations after an initial episode of anaphylaxis,"'People who have experienced anaphylaxis of any cause should be educated about their trigger(s) and the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Those at risk for anaphylaxis should carry an ''epinephrine auto-injector'' (''EpiPen'', Adrenaclick) and understand when and how to use it. A wrist bracelet indicating the risk and trigger(s) for anaphylaxis can be helpful. Allergic diseases are often treated by avoidance measures, which will be reviewed in detail below.' "
What are emergency measures used in the treatment of anaphylaxis?,"'If you suspect that you or someone you are with is having an anaphylactic reaction, the following are important ''first aid'' measures. In general, try to perform these in the order that they are presented.''After the initial epinephrine dose, if the symptoms are returning or still significant, one can inject another dose of epinephrine if available. All self-injectable epinephrine devices come in a two-pack for this reason. Even if anaphylaxis responds to epinephrine, a person should be monitored in an emergency care setting. Steroids and antihistamines may be given, but these are not helpful in the initial management of anaphylaxis, and should not take the place of epinephrine. Steroids may be most helpful to prevent a biphasic reaction.''The normal side effects of epinephrine include pallor, shakiness, a rapid heart rate, and a sense of doom. These symptoms resolve rapidly, typically within minutes.'  If the patient has injectable epinephrine (such as an auto-injector), inject epinephrine immediately. The shot is given into the upper outer thigh and can be administered through clothing. Call emergency services or 911 immediately. Have a second injectable epinephrine device ready to use in case of a severe reaction or a biphasic reaction. Place a conscious person lying down, and elevate the feet if possible. Stay with the person until help arrives. If trained, begin CPR if the person stops breathing or doesn't have a pulse."
What is the treatment for anaphylaxis?,"'Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is the first-line therapy for anaphylaxis. It acts to reverse the effects of anaphylaxis on all body systems. Its effects include the following:''Skin'': improves itching and hives''Respiratory'': relaxes bronchial tubes in lungs, thus improving shortness of breath, chest tightness, and ''cough''Gastrointestinal'': diminishes ''abdominal pain'', cramping, and ''nausea''Cardiovascular'': constricts blood vessels, thus improving ''blood pressure''Epinephrine also helps prevent the release of more mediators of the allergic reaction. ''Diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') is not first-line therapy for anaphylaxis. This has primary effects on improving skin symptoms, such as hives and itching. In cases of severe anaphylaxis, in addition to epinephrine, other medications, IV fluids, and oxygen are administered once one receives care from a health care professional. The choice of interventions will depend on the severity of the reaction.''Anaphylaxis may be biphasic roughly 20%-30% of the time. This is also known as a ""late-phase reaction."" In biphasic anaphylaxis, symptoms improve but then return hours to even days later. Treatment for biphasic reactions is the same as treatment of initial anaphylactic reactions. It is thought that steroids might reduce the risk of a biphasic reaction.' "
Is it possible to prevent anaphylaxis?,"'Preventing anaphylaxis is the ideal form of treatment. However, that may not always be easy since insect stings are frequently unanticipated, and allergens in foods may be ingested by mistake. A consultation with an allergist is vital in helping one identify the trigger(s) and providing information and instruction on how to best avoid them. The affected individual will learn how to use emergency kits and how to become prepared for any reaction in the future.''These are situations in which preventive treatment might be offered by the allergist.''Since avoidance is not fail-safe, a person at risk for an anaphylactic reaction must be adequately prepared in an emergency to handle a reaction. It is recommended that everyone at risk carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen or Adrenaclick).''Here are some important points to remember regarding self- injectable epinephrine:'   Allergy shots may be suggested to some people with wasp, yellow jacket, hornet, honey bee, or fire ant reactions. This form of treatment gives 98% protection against the first four insect reactions and also reduces the severity of any reactions that may occur. Premedication is most helpful in preventing anaphylaxis from IV contrast. Alternative dyes that are less likely to cause reactions may be available. Temporary induction of tolerance (also called desensitization) to problematic medications is often effective. This process is accomplished by gradually increasing the amount of the medication given under controlled conditions. Sensitivities to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and insulin have been successfully treated in this way. Food immunotherapy in which individuals are given small daily doses of a food to which they are allergic is an area of current research for milk, eggs, and peanuts but is not used in routine clinical practice at this point. Advise all health care personnel of any allergies. Remember and describe symptoms involved in a reaction to previous drugs.Ask a doctor whether the prescribed medication contains the drug(s) one is allergic to. Ask a doctor whether the prescribed medication contains the drug(s) one is allergic to. Avoid areas where stinging insects are attracted and avoid insect nests. Avoid bright clothing, perfume, hair spray, or lotion that might attract insects. Wear long-sleeved clothing, long trousers, and shoes while outdoors. Carefully read all labels. Foods containing milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish must be labeled by law. Ask specifically about ingredients when eating at restaurants. Do not eat foods with unknown ingredients. It is typically best to avoid foods with precautionary labeling (""may contain,"" ""made in a factory with,"" etc.). Avoid all latex products. Inform health care professionals of latex allergy. Make sure the hospital or doctor's office has latex-free supplies. Ask a doctor to explain the use of the device carefully and practice with the demonstrator kit. Check expiration dates and replace outdated devices. The expiration date must be followed for epinephrine. Keep devices out of extremes of temperature since this influences drug stability. Additional devices should be brought to other homes, school, or work. Always have two devices readily available. Make sure that friends, relatives, exercise partners, and coworkers are aware of one's condition and know what to do in case of a reaction."
What is the prognosis of anaphylaxis?,"'Risk factors for poor outcomes from anaphylaxis include delayed treatment with epinephrine and a history of ''asthma'', particularly uncontrolled asthma. In the community, the most common causes of poor outcomes are stinging-insect allergy in adults and a history of peanut and tree nut allergy. Death from anaphylaxis from these causes is usually associated with delayed treatment with epinephrine. If recognized and treated promptly with epinephrine, the prognosis for anaphylaxis is generally good and the vast majority of patients experience a full recovery.' "
What is anemia?,"'Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or the hemoglobin is less than normal. The normal level of hemoglobin is generally different in males and females. For men, a normal hemoglobin level is typically defined as a level of more than 13.5 gram/100 ml, and in women as hemoglobin of more than 12.0 gram/100 ml. These definitions may vary slightly depending on the source and the laboratory reference used.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of anemia?,"'Some individuals with anemia have no symptoms. Others with anemia may:''Additional anemia symptoms may include:''If anemia is longstanding (chronic anemia), the body may adjust to low oxygen levels and the individual may not feel different unless the anemia becomes severe. On the other hand, if the anemia occurs rapidly (acute anemia), the patient may experience significant symptoms relatively quickly and with relatively mild fluctuations of hemoglobin levels.'   Feel tired Weakness Fatigue easily Appear pale Develop palpitations (feeling of heart racing) Notice shortness of breath Hair loss Malaise (general sense of feeling unwell) Worsening of heart problems"
What causes anemia?,"'Any process that can disrupt the normal life span of a red blood cell may cause anemia. Normal life span of a red blood cell is typically around 120 days. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.''Anemia is caused essentially through two basic pathways. Anemia is caused by either:''A more common classification of anemia (low hemoglobin) is based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which signifies the average volume of individual red blood cells.''Looking at each of the components of a ''complete blood count'' (CBC), especially the MCV, a physician can gather clues as to what could be the most common reason for anemia in each patient.' a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss or destruction of red blood cells. If the MCV is low (less than 80), the anemia is categorized as microcytic anemia (low red blood cell volume). If the MCV is in the normal range (80-100), it is called a normocytic anemia (normal red blood cell volume). If the MCV is high, then it is called a macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume)."
What is iron deficiency anemia?,"'Iron deficiency'"" is a very common cause of anemia. This is because iron is a major component of hemoglobin and essential for its proper function. Chronic blood loss due to any reason is the main cause of low iron level in the body as it depletes the body's iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of iron. Anemia that is due to low iron levels is called ""'iron deficiency anemia''.''Young women are likely to have low-grade ''iron deficiency'' anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal ''menstruation''. This is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary.''Another common reason for iron deficiency anemia can be recurring or small ongoing bleeding, for instance from ''colon cancer'' or from stomach ulcers. ''Stomach ulcer'' bleeding may be induced by medications, even very common ''over-the-counter'' ''drugs'' such as ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''). Slow and chronic oozing from these ulcers can lead to loss of iron. Crohn’s disease can lead to iron deficiency anemia. In infants and young children, iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a ''diet'' lacking iron.''Interpretation of a complete blood count test (CBC) may lead to clues to suggest this type of anemia. For instance, iron deficiency anemia usually presents with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.'  "
What is aplastic anemia?,"'Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening form of complete bone marrow failure. As a result, the blood contains inadequate numbers of red blood cells (anemia) as well as insufficient white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (''thrombocytopenia''). Complete bone marrow failure causes all three cell lines produced in the bone marrow to be inadequate, a condition referred to as pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia can occur at nearly any age. Its onset can be sudden or gradual.''The symptoms of this anemia are similar to the symptoms of all anemias ( see above ) as well as recurrent infections and abnormal bleeding.''Causes of aplastic anemia include:' Chronic exposure to toxic chemicals Cancer treatments (radiation therapy; chemotherapy) Infections (certain viral infections) Medications (for examples, chloramhenicol, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) Myelodysplastic syndromes Genetic abnormalities"
What are other types and causes of anemia?,"'Some of the most common anemia causes include:' Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause pernicious anemia. This type of anemia could happen in people who are unable to absorb vitamin B12 from their intestines due to a number of reasons.Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements.Long-term alcoholics.People who have abnormal structure or function of the stomach or intestines leading to impaired B12 absorption despite adequate intake.This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements. Long-term alcoholics. People who have abnormal structure or function of the stomach or intestines leading to impaired B12 absorption despite adequate intake. This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. There can be rupture or destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) due to antibodies clinging to the surface of the red blood cells. Examples of hemolytic anemia include hemolytic disease of the newborn, medication-induced hemolytic anemia, transfusion-related hemolysis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A wide assortment of bone marrow diseases can cause anemia.For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia.Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia.Certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia.Finally, patients with kidney disease may lack a hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow.Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to anemia via different pathways and thus, anemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia. Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia. Certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia. Finally, patients with kidney disease may lack a hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow. Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to anemia via different pathways and thus, anemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. Another common cause of anemia is called anemia of chronic disease. This could typically occur in individuals with longstanding chronic diseases. Some medications can cause anemia in a variety of ways. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can cause anemia."
Can anemia be hereditary?,"'Yes, anemia may be genetic. Hereditary disorders create abnormal hemoglobin and can shorten the life span of the red blood cell and lead to anemia (for example, ''sickle cell disease''). Hereditary disorders can also cause anemia by impairing the production of normal hemoglobin (for example, ''alpha thalassemia'' and ''beta thalassemia'').''Depending on the degree of the genetic abnormality, hereditary anemias may cause mild, moderate, or severe anemia. In fact, some may be too severe to be compatible with life and may result in death of the fetus (unborn infant). On the other hand, some of these anemias are so mild that they are not noticeable and are incidentally revealed during routine blood work.' "
How does blood loss cause anemia?,'Acute blood loss from ''internal bleeding'' (as from a bleeding ulcer) or external bleeding (as from ''trauma'') can produce anemia in an amazingly short span of time. ''This type of anemia results in severe symptoms and consequences if not addressed promptly''. Severe sudden blood loss anemia may cause:' Dizziness Lightheadedness Fatigue Confusion Shortness of breath Loss of consciousness
How is anemia diagnosed?,"'Anemia is usually detected, or at least confirmed, by a complete blood cell (CBC) count. A CBC test may be ordered by a physician as a part of routine general checkup and screening or based on clinical signs and symptoms that may suggest anemia or other blood abnormalities.' "
What is a complete blood cell (CBC) count?,"'Traditionally, a doctor or a laboratory technician performed a CBC analysis by viewing a glass slide prepared from a blood sample under a microscope. Today, this work is automated. Six component measurements make up a CBC test:''Only the first three of these anemia tests -- the red blood cell (RBC) count, the hematocrit, and the hemoglobin -- are relevant to an anemia diagnosis.''Additionally, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also often reported in a CBC, which basically measures the average volume of red blood cells in a blood sample. This is important in distinguishing the causes of anemia. Units of MCV are reported in femtoliters, a fraction of one millionth of a liter.''Other useful clues to causes of anemia that are reported in a CBC are the size, shape, and color of red blood cells.' Red blood cell (RBC) count Hematocrit Hemoglobin White blood cell (WBC) count Differential blood count Platelet count"
How is blood collected for a CBC?,"""Blood is collected by venipuncture (using a needle to draw blood from a vein) in a lab, hospital, or doctor's office. Typically, blood is collected in a special sterile tube from an arm vein. The tube has some preservatives to prevent clotting of the blood. Results may be available in an hour or longer depending on the setting.""'In some instances, a quick in-office test called hemoglobin rapid test may be performed using a few drops of blood from a finger prick. The advantage of this quick test is that results may be obtained in a few minutes and only a few drops of blood may be required.' "
What is the red blood cell (RBC) count?,"'The red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) are the most common type of cells in the blood. We each have millions and millions of these little disc-shaped cells. The RBC count is done to determine if the number of red blood cells is low (anemia) or high (''polycythemia'').''In an RBC count, the number and size of the RBCs are determined. This is usually reported as number of RBCs per a specified volume, typically in millions of RBCs in microliters (one one-thousandth of an ml) of whole blood. The shape of the RBCs is also evaluated under a microscope. All of this information -- the number, size and shape of the RBCs -- is useful in the diagnosis of anemia. Further, the specific type of anemia may be determined by this information.' "
What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is a red pigment that imparts the familiar red color to red blood cells and to blood. Functionally, hemoglobin is the key chemical compound that combines with oxygen from the ''lungs'' and carries the oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. Oxygen is essential for all cells in the body to produce energy.''The blood also transports carbon dioxide, which is the waste product of this energy production process, back to the lungs from which it is exhaled into the air. The transport of the carbon dioxide back to the lung is also achieved by hemoglobin. The carbon dioxide bound to hemoglobin is unloaded in the lungs in exchange for oxygen to be transported to the tissues of the body.' "
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'Low hemoglobin is called anemia. When there is a low hemoglobin level, there is often a low red blood cell count and a low hematocrit, too. Reference ranges are slightly different from one source to another, but typically hemoglobin of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml in men and less than 12.0 gram/100 ml in women is abnormal.' "
What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is specifically a measure of how much of the blood is made of ''red cells''. The hematocrit is a very convenient way to determine whether the red blood cell count is too high, too low, or normal. The hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of blood that is composed of the red blood cells.' "
How is hematocrit determined?,"""The red blood cells in the sample of blood can quickly be determined by spinning a tube of blood in a centrifuge under prescribed conditions. The proportion of the tube that consists of red blood cells is then measured. Let's say that it is 45%. The hematocrit is 45%."" "
How can anemia be treated?,"'Anemia treatment varies greatly. First, the underlying cause of the anemia needs to be identified and corrected. For example, anemia as a result of blood loss from a stomach ulcer should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. Likewise, surgery is often necessary to remove a colon ''cancer'' that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia.''Sometimes ''iron supplements'' will also be needed to correct iron deficiency. In severe anemia, blood transfusions may be necessary. Vitamin B12 injections will be necessary for patients with ''pernicious anemia'' or other causes of B12 deficiency.''In certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from chemotherapy) or patients with ''kidney failure'', ''epoetin alfa'' (''Procrit'', ''Epogen'') may be used to stimulate bone marrow red blood cell production.''If a medication is thought to be the culprit, then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.'  "
What are the complications of anemia?,"'As mentioned earlier, hemoglobin has the important role of delivering oxygen to all parts of the body for consumption and carries back carbon dioxide back to the lung to exhale it out of the body. If the hemoglobin level is too low, this process may be impaired, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the body (''hypoxia'""). Depending on the severity of the anemia and the length of the patient's illness, the anemia could have no long-term complications or have significant complications."" "
What is the prognosis for a person with anemia?,"'Anemia generally has a very good prognosis and it may be curable in many instances. The overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause of anemia, its severity, and the overall health of the patient.' "
What is anencephaly?,"'Anencephaly is a condition that prevents the normal development of the brain and the bones of the skull. This condition results when a structure called the neural tube fails to close during the first few weeks of embryonic development. The neural tube is a layer of cells that ultimately develops into the brain and spinal cord. Because anencephaly is caused by abnormalities of the neural tube, it is classified as a neural tube defect (NTD).' "
"What are the causes, signs, and symptoms of anencephaly?","'If the neural tube fails to close properly, the developing brain and spinal cord are exposed to the ''amniotic fluid'' that surrounds the fetus. This exposure causes the nervous system tissue to break down (degenerate). As a result, people with anencephaly are missing large parts of the brain called the cerebrum and cerebellum. These brain regions are necessary for thinking, ''hearing'', vision, emotion, and coordinating movement. The bones of the skull are also missing or incompletely formed.''Almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth or within a few hours or days after birth.' "
How common is anencephaly?,"'Anencephaly is one of the most common types of neural tube defect, affecting about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. However, most of these pregnancies end in ''miscarriage'', so the prevalence of this condition in newborns is much lower. An estimated 1 in 10,000 infants in the United States is born with anencephaly.' "
What genes are related to anencephaly?,"'Anencephaly is a complex condition that is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown.'' Changes in dozens of genes may influence the risk of anencephaly. The best-studied of these genes is ''MTHFR'', which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the B-vitamin folate (also called ''folic acid'' or vitamin B9). Changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for anencephaly. However, none of these genes appear to play a major role in causing the condition.''Researchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. A shortage (deficiency) of folate appears to play a significant role. Studies have shown that women who take ''supplements'' containing this vitamin before they get ''pregnant'' and very early in their ''pregnancy'' are significantly less likely to have a baby with anencephaly or a related neural tube defect. Other possible risk factors for anencephaly include ''diabetes mellitus'', ''obesity'', exposure to high heat (such as a ''fever'' or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy, and the use of certain anti-''seizure'' medications during pregnancy. However, it is unclear how these factors may influence the risk of anencephaly.' "
How do people inherit anencephaly?,"'Most cases of anencephaly are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of cases have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. For parents who have had a child with anencephaly, the risk of having another affected child is increased compared to the risk in the general population.' "
Are a stroke and an aneurysm the same thing?,"'No, a ''stroke'' and an aneurysm are not the same thing. They are two very different medical health problems. ''Stroke'' is a process or an event that happens in your body, while an aneurysm is a problem with a person’s anatomy (anatomical abnormality).' "
What is a stroke?,"'There are two major types of ''stroke'' – ischemic ''strokes'' and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked by a ''blood clot''. The other type is a hemorrhagic stroke where a blood vessel leaks due to weakened blood vessel walls or due to damage by traumatic injury. The leaking vessels allow blood to leak into the brain tissue resulting in loss of blood to brain tissues, and because the leaked blood is under pressure, it can squeeze off other blood vessels that supply blood to other areas of the brain close to the blood vessel injury.' "
What is an aneurysm?,"'An aneurysm is a ''weakness'' in an artery wall that allows the artery to abnormally widen or balloon out. This anatomical feature can occur almost anywhere in the body, for example, cerebral aneurysms (brain aneurysms), aortic aneurysms, and splenic aneurysms and others. This article will only discuss brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is not a process like stroke but an anatomic abnormality.'  "
Are the causes of a stroke and brain aneurysm the same?,"'No, the causes of these two conditions are very different.''Strokes are caused by a cut off of oxygen to brain cells. Ischemic stroke happens when a ''blood clot'' blocks an area in an arterial blood vessel in the brain. This type of stroke accounts for about 80% of strokes.''A ''brain aneurysm'' may be caused by congenital (present at birth) blood vessel problems happen as a result of blood vessel disease over time, or result from injury and/or damage to the blood vessel. Almost all brain aneurysms have no symptoms until they begin to leak blood. When the aneurysm leaks blood, they are considered to be a cause of a hemorrhagic stroke and this is a medical emergency.' Ischemic strokes are caused by blood clots that form on the inside of the arteries or by a blood clot or cholesterol plaque fragment from elsewhere in the body (usually the heart). A hemorrhagic stroke is due to blood leaking out of a brain artery into brain tissue. Because of this leakage, the brain receives less oxygen. And, because the blood is under pressure, the bleeding into adjacent brain tissue can compress other vessels and deprive areas next the injured blood vessel or artery (adjacent brain tissue) of oxygen. This type of stroke accounts for about 20% of strokes."
What are the differences between the symptoms and signs of stroke vs brain aneurysm?,"""Unless a brain aneurysm leaks or bursts open, there usually aren't any symptoms. However, if the aneurysm does leak or burst open, then signs and symptoms are the same for a stroke, which also is the cause of a hemorrhagic stroke. A very slow leak from a brain aneurysm may cause ""'headaches'' or a large aneurysm may cause blurry vision, ''loss of vision'', facial droop and possibly ''headaches''.''The symptoms and signs for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are similar. The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association emphasize four letters and three numbers to consider if a person is having a stroke. They suggest the following ''FAST'' system to recognize and treat strokes:''Other symptoms may appear either separately or in combination with the above, and they all happen suddenly without warning:''If you think someone is having a stroke or aneurysm call 911 immediately.'  F - facial drooping A - arm weakness S - speech difficulty T – time - do not delay call these three numbers – 911 Confusion Numbness or weakness in the extremities, especially on one side of the body Vision problems Difficulty walking along with dizziness, lack of coordination and/or balance Severe headache with no known cause Seizures Loss of memory Trouble getting words out Trouble typing, texting, or other problems with motor coordination"
What is the treatment for these diseases?,"'Treatment for stroke is time-dependent and type dependent. If ''stroke symptoms'"" are noticed, call 911 and have the patient taken to a stroke center, and don't give them ""'aspirin''. Once at the hospital, the patient will have a CT of the head to determine if the person has an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This is very important because subsequent treatments are markedly different for these two types of stroke.''If the stroke is diagnosed as ischemic, the treatment may involve an IV infusion of a “clot-busting” drug (r-tPA or tissue plasminogen activator) to open the blood vessel. If the stroke is determined to be hemorrhagic, usually a neurosurgeon, neurologist and in some hospitals, and invasive neuroradiologist will be consulted to reduce or stop the bleeding and/or surgically decompress the blood clot. It’s important that the diagnosis between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is made - treating a hemorrhagic stroke with a clot-busting drug will increase bleeding and likely will cause the patient to die. In certain circumstances, there may be no effective acute treatment for a stroke.''Treatment of brain aneurysms that aren’t leaking (or have a very slow leak) varies from patient to patient, but usually involves supportive measures like reducing ''high blood pressure'' with medication under the care of a doctor or other health care professional.''However, other treatments such as endovascular treatments that place coils in the aneurysm to promote thrombosis that results in obliteration of the aneurysm and/or surgical therapy by clipping the base or bottom of the aneurysm, much like tying off the end of a balloon to prevent further expansion and/or any leaking. Your medical condition and advice from your team (primary care doctor, neurosurgeon, neurologist and/or interventional neuroradiologist) play significant roles in deciding what treatment course is best for you.' "
What's the prognosis for stroke and aneurysm?,"'The prognosis for an ischemic stroke is highly variable and depends on where the clot occurs in the brain, how long the clot remains before it is treated, and how effective the treatment is. Consequently, ischemic strokes may vary in prognosis from good to poor, depending upon the above conditions and how well the patient responds to treatment and/or rehabilitation. Hemorrhagic strokes more often have a poorer prognosis and have a higher mortality rate than ischemic strokes.''The prognosis for brain aneurysms is usually good as long as they don’t leak or burst open. Prophylactic treatment of brain aneurysms is still controversial because there is a chance that any attempt to use endovascular treatments or surgical clipping actually may cause aneurysm to begin bleeding. Some procedures have a mortality rate of 3%. If the brain aneurysm leaks, the prognosis is poor and mortality is high unless acute neurosurgical or neurointerventional treatment is successful.' "
What is Angelman Syndrome?,"'Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system that causes developmental delay and neurological problems. The physician Harry Angelman first delineated the syndrome in 1965, when he described several children in his practice as having ""flat heads, jerky movements, protruding tongues, and bouts of laughter.""' "
"What are the characteristics, signs, and symptoms of Angelman syndrome?","'Angelman syndrome results from absence of a functional copy of the ''UBE3A'' gene ''inherited'' from the mother. '   Infants with Angelman syndrome appear normal at birth, but often have feeding problems in the first months of life and exhibit noticeable developmental delays by 6 to 12 months.  Seizures often begin between 2 and 3 years of age.  Speech impairment is pronounced, with little to no use of words. Individuals with this syndrome often display 
the following that can have severe functional deficits:

hyperactivity, 
small head size, 

sleep disorders, 
	
movement and
	balance disorders

 
hyperactivity,  small head size,  
sleep disorders, 
	 movement and
	balance disorders Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. 
	 In addition to hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common.
	 With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. 
	 Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as ""coarse."" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal."
Is there any treatment for Angelman syndrome?,"'There is no specific therapy for Angelman syndrome. Medical therapy for seizures is usually necessary. Physical and occupational therapies, communication therapy, and behavioral therapies are important in allowing individuals with Angelman syndrome to reach their maximum developmental potential. '  "
What is the prognosis for Angelman syndrome?,"'Most individuals with Angelman syndrome will have severe developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor difficulties. However, individuals with Angelman syndrome can have normal life spans and generally do not show developmental regression as they age. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions and therapies help improve quality of life. ' "
What research is being done on Angelman syndrome?,"'The NINDS supports and conducts research on neurogenetic disorders such as Angelman syndrome, to develop techniques to diagnose, treat, prevent, and ultimately cure them. ' "

What is vasculitis?,"'Vasculitis is a general term for a group of uncommon diseases that feature inflammation of the blood vessels. The blood vessels of the body are referred to as the vascular system. The blood vessels are comprised of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the ''lungs'' for oxygen. Vasculitis is characterized by inflammation in and damage to the walls of various blood vessels.''Each of the vasculitis diseases is defined by certain patterns of distribution of blood vessel involvement, particular organ involvement, and laboratory test abnormalities. As a group, these diseases are referred to as vasculitides.''The word vasculitis is derived from the Latin ""vasculum"", vessel + ""- itis,"" inflammation. Another term for vasculitis is angiitis. When arteries are the inflamed blood vessels, the condition is also referred to as arteritis. When the veins are inflamed, it is referred to as venulitis.'  "
What causes vasculitis?,"'The actual cause of these vasculitis diseases is usually not known. However, immune system abnormality and inflammation of blood vessels are common features. Each form of vasculitis has its own characteristic pattern of symptoms, much of which depends on what particular organs are affected.''Examples of vasculitis include:''Vasculitis can also accompany:'   Kawasaki disease, Behçet's disease, Polyarteritis nodosa, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,, Cryoglobulinemia, Takayasu's arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis), and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Infections (such as hepatitis B), Exposure to chemicals (such as amphetamines and cocaine), Medications, Cancers (such as lymphomas and multiple myeloma), and Rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)."
What are the symptoms of vasculitis?,"'The symptoms of vasculitis vary greatly from person to person, and depend upon the organs affected and the severity.'   Generally, vasculitis causes fatigue and malaise. Sometimes vasculitis can lead to weakness and weight loss. Vasculitis affecting the skin can cause rashes, skin discoloration, and ulcers. Vasculitis affecting the muscles can cause muscle pain. Vasculitis affecting the lungs can cause shortness of breath and cough. Vasculitis affecting the heart can cause congestive heart failure. Vasculitis affecting the brain can cause headaches, confusion, seizures, stroke, paralysis, numbness, and lightheadedness. Vasculitis affecting the kidneys can cause kidney failure."
What tests diagnose vasculitis?,"'Laboratory testing of blood or body fluids in a patient with active vasculitis generally indicates inflammation in the body. Depending on the degree of organ involvement, a variety of organ function tests can be abnormal.''The diagnosis of vasculitis is definitively established after a biopsy of involved tissue demonstrates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation. Examples of tissues used for biopsy include skin, sinuses, lung, nerve, and kidney. Depending upon the situation, an alternative to biopsy can be an X-ray test of the blood vessels called an angiogram, which can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.'  "
What is the treatment for vasculitis?,"'The treatment of the various forms of vasculitis is based on the severity of the illness and the organs involved.''The management of vasculitis is an evolving field in medicine. The ideal programs for monitoring and treatment will continue to improve as disease patterns and causes are defined by medical research.'   Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, cortisone-related medications, such as prednisone , are used. Additionally, other immune suppression drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and others are considered. Additionally, affected organs (such as the heart or lungs) may require specific medical treatment when the disease is active."
What is angina? What does it feel like?,"   Angina (angina pectoris) describes the pain, discomfort, ache, or other associated symptoms that occur when blood flow to heart muscle cells is not enough to meet its energy needs. The classic description of angina is a crushing pain, heaviness or pressure that radiates across the chest, sometimes down the arm, into the neck, jaw or teeth, or into the back. It may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and weakness. Many people do not use pain as a description for angina, instead describing the sensation as a fullness, tightness, burning, squeezing, or ache. The discomfort may be felt in the upper abdomen, between the shoulders, or in the back. The pain may be felt just in an arm, right, left or both, and may or may not be associated with other symptoms. Angina is often brought on by exercise and other strenuous activities and gets better with rest. When the body requires the heart to pump more blood, the heart muscle is asked to do more work and that can cause it to outstrip its energy supply. When the body rests, angina should start to subside. Angina tends to progress slowly over time and patients may not recognize that their symptoms are due to heart disease. It may be fatigue and exercise intolerance, the gradually inability to perform work or other activities that had once been easier to do. It may be shortness of breath with activity like walking up steps or uphill. It is worrisome when the pain comes on at rest or at sleep, since it means that little activity is causing enough stress to cause angina symptoms. This is the same situation that occurs when muscles in the leg or arm fatigue because of overuse and they begin to ache. The difference is that one can stop lifting or running but the heart cannot stop beating to rest. The other difference is that the symptoms of angina are felt in different ways by different patients and may not be recognized as coming from the heart. Unfortunately for some patients, they may have no symptoms at all, even with significant narrowing of their coronary arteries, and they may first present for care in the midst of a myocardial infarction or heart attack, when a coronary artery is completely blocked. This is especially true for women who may have atypical angina symptoms including fatigue, malaise, weakness, and dizziness. Angina is a warning sign that the heart muscle is not getting adequate blood supply and oxygen. If unheeded it may lead to a heart attack or myocardial infarction (myo=muscle + cardium=heart + infarct=death). The term mesenteric angina may also be used to describe abdominal pain due to decreased blood supply to the intestine from narrowing of the mesenteric arteries that supply the small and large bowel. Unfortunately, there are a couple of eponyms that contain the term angina, that have nothing to do with pain from decreased blood flow. Ludwig's angina is a serious infection of the floor of the mouth. Vincent's angina is another term for trench mouth, where painful ulcerations affect the gums, mouth, and tongue."
What are the signs and symptoms of angina? Does it cause pain?,"'Classic angina is described as chest pressure that radiates down the arm, into the neck or jaw and is associated with shortness of breath and ''sweating''. However, patients may use different words to describe the pain, including pain, heaviness, tightness, ache, and fullness. The location may or may not be in the chest; instead it may be described in the upper abdomen, back, arms, shoulder, or neck.''Typical angina symptoms should be made worse with activity and should resolve or get better with rest.''Angina may not have any pain and instead may present as shortness of breath with exercise, malaise, fatigue, or weakness. Patients with ''diabetes'' have an altered sensation of pain and may have markedly atypical symptoms. Women may not have the same angina constellation of symptoms as men.'

  "
What causes angina?,"'The heart gets its blood supply from coronary arteries that branch off the ''aorta'' just as it leaves the heart. The coronary arteries run along the surface of the heart, branching into smaller and smaller blood vessels as they supple each muscle cell of the heart. The most common reason a patient complains of angina is because of narrowed coronary arteries caused by ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease'' (ASHD).''Cholesterol'' plaque gradually builds on the inner lining of a coronary artery, narrowing its diameter and decreasing the amount of blood that can flow past the blockage. If the heart is asked to do more work and pump harder and faster, enough oxygen may not be able to be delivered beyond the blockage to meet the energy demand of the ''myocardium'' and this can cause the symptoms of angina to occur.''If a plaque ruptures, a ''blood clot'' may form that completely occludes the coronary artery and prevents any blood flow to the section of the heart muscle that the artery supplies. This is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction and is a medical emergency. Heart muscle that loses its blood supply will die and be replaced with ''scar tissue'"" that is unable to contract. This may decrease the heart's ability to pump as strongly as before. As well, heart muscle that loses its blood supply can become irritable and result in heart rhythm disturbances like ventricular ""'fibrillation'' or ventricular ''flutter'' that can result in ''sudden cardiac death''.''Because each beat of the heart not only sends blood to the body, but also to itself, there are a variety of systems in the body and within the heart that have to function normally to deliver oxygen to the heart muscle. Should any of them, either individually or in combination, fail to perform adequately, angina may occur. Examples include the following:''If any of these steps fail, the heart muscle may not get enough oxygen and the patient may feel pain or discomfort called angina.'   The electrical system of the heart needs to be able to generate a heartbeat that is neither too slow (bradycardia) nor too fast (tachycardia). There may be an intrinsic problem with the heart's electrical conducting system. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia are too fast rates that can be associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, and other angina symptoms. Complete heart block can make the heart beat too slowly. The abnormal heart rhythm may be due to electrolyte or hormone abnormalities, medications, or toxic ingestions (for example cocaine overdose). Heart valves need to allow blood to flow between heart chambers and to the body and lungs in the right direction and at the right speed. This is especially true of the aortic valve that controls blood leaving the heart into the aorta. Severe aortic stenosis or narrowing of the aortic valve, may not allow enough blood to leave the heart with each heartbeat to provide blood flow into the coronary arteries. The heart muscle has to be able to have an adequate squeeze or strength to pump blood. The lack of this ability may be due to cardiomyopathy (damaged heart muscle). There needs to be enough red blood cells in the bloodstream to carry oxygen. Patients who have anemia can develop shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain with activity. The lungs need to work so that they deliver enough oxygen to the body. Patients with COPD or emphysema may not be able to extract enough oxygen from the air to supply the body's needs. Most often these patients have shortness of breath but they may also develop angina. Certain poisonings including carbon monoxide can prevent oxygen from attaching to red blood cells and cause shortness of breath and chest pain."
What are the types of angina?,"'Angina due to a decrease or lack of coronary artery blood flow''Angina is most often caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries because of atherosclerotic ''heart disease''. There may be one or more arteries that are blocked and the amount of pain or other symptom severity is not necessarily related to the number of blood vessels blocked. Usually, there has to be at least a 50% narrowing of a coronary artery to cause symptoms.''Prinzmetal angina describes pain that is caused when a coronary artery goes into spasm temporarily decreasing blood supply to a section of heart muscle.''Microvascular angina describes narrowing of small arteries to cause areas of the heart to have decreased blood flow. The large coronary arteries may be normal.''Syndrome X'' cardiac disease describes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle with normal coronary arteries not caused by the vasospasm that is seen in Prinzmetal angina. This may be a variant of microvascular angina.''Rare causes may also include abnormalities that occur with the coronary arteries that are not due to ASHD including scarring that can occur from chest ''radiation'', inflammation of the arteries because of underlying illness like ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''scleroderma'"", and Kawasaki's disease, as well as congenital abnormalities affecting coronary artery anatomy.""'Other causes of angina''Some causes for angina are multifactorial. For example, a patient with atherosclerotic heart disease may become acutely ill or injured, where a ''fever'' or anemia may compound the inability of narrowed blood vessels to deliver oxygen to heart muscle cells. Or a patient who abuses cocaine can increase heart rate plus cause coronary arteries to constrict, leading to angina.'   Poorly controlled high blood pressure (hypertension) can place significant strain on the heart muscle as it continues to pump blood, causing pain. Aortic stenosis describes the narrowed valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle, the chamber of the heart that pumps blood to the body, into the aorta. If the valve narrows enough, decreased blood flow into the coronary arteries may be the cause of angina. Cardiomyopathy describes a variety of conditions where the heart muscle is unable to adequately pump blood to meet the body and the heart's oxygen needs. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, heart muscle that has been damaged by atherosclerotic heart disease, is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. Situations exist that can cause the body not to be able to meet the heart's demand for oxygen. These include anemia and poisonings. Other circumstances may occur where the heart's oxygen demand is increased and angina occurs. Oxygen demand increases when the heart is asked to pump harder and faster. Examples include tachycardias like atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter that are out of control, fevers, hyperthyroidism, and the stress of major illness, infection, and trauma."
How is angina diagnosed?,"""The preliminary diagnosis of angina usually is made by the patient's history. The health care professional needs to understand what symptoms the patient is experiencing and may ask similar questions in a variety of ways to gain that understanding. This may be a frustrating process for both patient and professional because the symptoms of angina can range from classic to vague.""'Part of the history will be to assess risk factors for heart disease. These include ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', ''diabetes'', family history, and ''smoking''. Histories of ''stroke'' (''cerebrovascular accident'' or CVA) or ''peripheral artery disease'' (PAD) are both risk factors since the mechanism of these diseases, ''hardening of the arteries'' or ''atherosclerosis'' are the same as for heart disease.''There are other diseases that can cause chest pain, ''abdominal pain'', shortness of breath, sweating, and ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Questions may be asked to determine whether other possibilities other than angina exist. ''Pulmonary embolism'', ''pneumonia'', ''aortic aneurysm'', ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), ''peptic ulcer'' disease, and ''gallbladder disease'' are bit a few of the potential causes of symptoms other than angina.''Physical examination will help narrow the potential list of diseases but in of itself, will not make the formal diagnosis.''This is the time that the health care professional has to make a clinical decision as to the source of symptoms. If the tentative or provisional diagnosis is angina, a further decision has to be made whether it is stable or unstable.''With ''stable angina'', a defined exercise will bring on the symptoms and rest will make it better. For example, a patient gets chest discomfort after walking 2 miles and it gets better with 5 minutes of rest. The pain pattern is constant and the amount of exercise required to bring on the symptoms has not been getting shorter. Often a patient with known angina will take a ''nitroglycerin'' pill to resolve the pain and it does so promptly.''Unstable angina'' usually happens at rest, wakens the patient at night, or comes on with minimal activity. These are times when the heart muscle is not being asked to work harder and yet angina symptoms may be present. Unstable angina is a potential warning sign of impending heart attack. There may be a transition from stable to unstable and the patient may describe decreasing amounts of exertion needed to bring on the angina symptoms.''Over time, a patient with angina may have their symptoms brought on by less and less activity. This progression needs to be monitored closely by both patient and doctor. The frequency of nitroglycerin use may be a clue that a coronary artery might be getting critically narrow increasing the risk of heart attack.''If angina is the major consideration, then an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') is usually performed. The electrical signal tracing of the heart can be interpreted to decide if heart muscle is damaged. The initial EKGs most important function is to decide if the patient is in the midst of suffering a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI). This is a medical emergency.''If the EKG does not show a new heart attack and if the patient has stable symptoms, the next step depends upon the situation. Blood tests may be done to check cardiac enzymes. These are chemicals (troponin, CPK, myoglobin) contained in heart muscle cells that may leak into the bloodstream if the cell is injured. If the chemicals are not detected, then the presumption is that if the pain is due to ASHD, critical narrowing has not caused heart muscle damage. However, the tests need to be done and interpreted based upon the clinical situation.''With a stable EKG, resolved symptoms, and concern still present that the patient has angina, tests to image the heart may be considered. These may include one or more of the following: stress tests, nuclear imaging, ''echocardiogram'', cardiac ''CT scan'', and heart catheterization. The decision as to what test is most appropriate depends upon the patient, their symptoms, underlying health, risk factors, and the level of concern of the health care professional.'

What is the treatment for angina?,"'Treatment for angina depends upon the cause and may include behavior modification, exercise, medication, and surgery.''Should the cause be ASHD, medications may be used to help minimize progression of artery narrowing and plaque buildup. Medications can be also be used to decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart and to allow the heart muscle to function more efficiently.''Aspirin'' may be recommended to make platelets less sticky to prevent clot formation and prevent heart attack.''Long-acting nitroglycerin medications (Imdur, Nitropaste) may be prescribed to dilate coronary arteries and increase blood flow to the heart muscle. As well, nitroglycerin may be used to abort an episode of angina. In this case it may be taken as a tablet or spray under the tongue.''The best treatment for angina is ''prevention'', especially if the cause is ASHD. Lifelong control of ''blood pressure'', cholesterol, and ''diabetes'' will help prevent the development of plaque buildup within arteries not only in the heart but also the brain and peripheral arteries as well. ''Smoking cessation'' is mandatory.'  "
Angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery,"'When patients continue to have angina despite maximally tolerated combinations of nitroglycerin medications, ''beta blockers'', and ''calcium channel blockers'', ''cardiac catheterization'' with coronary arteriography is indicated. Depending on the location and severity of the disease in the coronary arteries, patients can be referred for ''balloon angioplasty'' (''percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty'' or PTCA with or without ''stents'') or ''coronary artery bypass graft'' surgery (''CABG'') to increase coronary artery blood flow.'

What are other methods are used to evaluate angina?,"'CT scan calcium scoring is highly accurate in detecting small amounts of calcium in the plaque of coronary arteries. Ultrafast CT scanning is useful in evaluating chest pain in younger patients (men under 40 and women under 50 years old). Since young people do not normally have significant coronary artery plaque, a negative calcium score makes the diagnosis of ''coronary artery disease'' unlikely. However, finding calcium by this method is less meaningful in older patients who are likely to have mild plaquing simply from the ''aging'' process.''Even though a calcium score is useful in detecting calcium in plaque, it cannot determine whether the calcium-laden plaque actually causes artery narrowing and reduces blood flow. For example, a patient with a densely calcified plaque causing minimal or no artery narrowing will have a strongly positive CT scan, but a normal ''exercise stress test''. In most patients who are suspected of having angina due to ''coronary artery disease'', an exercise stress study is usually the first step in determining whether any plaque is clinically significant. High speed CT scanners can actually detect true coronary artery plaques and lesions similar to ''coronary angiography''.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'""), using magnetism and radio waves, can be used to image (produce a likeness of) the blood vessels. Larger vessels, such as the carotid arteries in the neck, can be imaged using this technique. Future software and hardware improvements may allow screening of the heart's arteries with magnetic resonance testing."" "
Can you die from angina?,"'Prevention offers the best prognosis, but that said, should angina be due to atherosclerotic heart disease, ''heart function'' and symptoms may be controlled with lifelong attention to ''diet'', exercise, and appropriately taking medications that may be prescribed.''The purpose in preventing progression of ASHD is to decrease the risk of heart attack. Should one of the coronary arteries become completely blocked, that section of heart muscle may die and be replaced with ''scar'' tissue. This leads to a weakened heart that will affect quality of life. Chronically decreased blood flow to heart muscle may not cause a single heart attack but may affect heart function and lead to ischemic cardiomyopathy and again affect lifestyle.''Patients with angina who have had a heart attack and continue to smoke have up to a 50% risk of another heart attack and death.''Patient with Prinzmetal angina and syndrome X have an excellent prognosis with little risk of long term heart damage.' "
Can angina be prevented?,"'The risk for atherosclerotic heart disease can be minimized by preventive medicine. Exercise, a healthy ''diet'', and avoiding ''smoking'' will decrease the likely of developing atherosclerotic heart disease, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease.''A patient should never smoke but heart attack risk begins to decrease shortly after he or she quits ''smoking''.''Lifelong screening and controlling ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''high cholesterol'', and diabetes will minimize the risk of developing heart disease but that risk does not become zero.''Understanding that angina and heart disease may not present with symptoms of chest pain may help a patient seek care from a health care professional. This may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.'  "
What are hives (urticaria) and angioedema? What do hives look like?,"'Hives (medically known as urticaria) appear on the skin as wheals that are red, very ''itchy'', smoothly elevated areas of skin often with a blanched center. They appear in varying shapes and sizes, from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter anywhere on the body.''It is estimated that 20% of all people will develop urticaria at some point in their lives. Hives are more common in women than in men. One hallmark of hives are their tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours. An individual ''hive'' usually lasts no longer than 24 hours. An outbreak that looks impressive, even alarming, first thing in the morning can be completely gone by noon, only to be back in full force later in the day. Very few skin diseases occur and then resolve so rapidly. Therefore, even if you have no evidence of hives to show the doctor when you get to the office for examination, the diagnosis can be established based upon the accurate recounting of your symptoms and signs. Because hives fluctuate so much and so fast, it is helpful to bring along a photograph of what the outbreak looked like at its most severe point.''Swelling deeper in the skin that may accompany hives is called ''angioedema''. This swelling of the hands and ''feet'', as well as the face (lips or eyelids), can be as dramatic as it is brief.'  "
What causes hives and angioedema? Are hives contagious? Does stress cause hives?,"'Hives appear when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells, which are normally found in the skin. Histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels, leading to swelling in the skin.''Hives are very common and are not considered ''contagious''. Although annoying, hives usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. Some hives may be caused by an\xa0''allergic reaction''\xa0to such things as foods, infections by different organisms, medications, food coloring, preservatives and ''insect stings'' or bites, and chemicals; but in the majority of cases, no specific cause is ever found. Although people may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives, maneuvers like changing ''diet'', soap, detergent, and ''makeup'' are rarely helpful in preventing hives unless there is an excellent temporal relationship. Since hives most often are produced by an immune mechanism, the condition is not contagious. If an infectious disease were the cause of hives in a particular person then it is possible, but not likely, that an infected contact could develop hives.''Having hives may cause ''stress'', but ''stress'' by itself does not cause hives.' "
What are the different kinds of hives?,"""Hives fall into two categories on the basis of the time they have been present: acute urticaria (ordinary hives, which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (that continues longer than six to eight weeks). Since hives are so common and acute urticaria, by definition, resolves spontaneously, physicians do not generally expend much time or expense to evaluate the cause of hives of less than eight weeks' duration."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of ordinary hives?,"'Symptoms of ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. Welts appear, often in several places. The welts may be skin-colored, pink, or red, and they flare, ''itch'', cause swelling, and go away in a matter of a few minutes to hours, only to appear elsewhere. This sequence may go on from days to weeks. Most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. Although that cutoff point is arbitrary, cases of hives that last more than six weeks are often called chronic hives.'  "
What are the risk factors and causes of ordinary hives?,"'As noted above, many cases of ordinary hives are ""idiopathic,"" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by ''allergic'' reactions or viral infections. A few may be caused by medications, usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (It is less likely for ''drugs'' taken continuously for long periods to cause hives but certainly not impossible.) When a medication is implicated as a cause of hives, the drug must be stopped, since testing is rarely available to confirm the cause. In most cases, drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. If a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away, this is a strong indication that the medication was not the cause of the hives.''Some medications, like morphine, ''codeine'', ''aspirin'', and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'', such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'']), cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. People with urticaria should avoid these medications.''Despite the reputation of hives being an ""allergic"" condition, there is often no obvious connection to any provoking substance. In this situation, random ''allergy'' testing is not usually helpful. If you know what is causing your hives, then avoiding the cause, if possible.' "
What are the causes of chronic hives?,"'Chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. The evaluation of this condition is difficult, and ''allergy'' testing and other laboratory tests are only occasionally useful in such cases. The accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history, personal habits, and oral intake. Occasionally, it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs (potential allergens) for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. Certain systemic diseases and infections, including parasitic infestations, may occasionally present in the skin as hives. If an inciting cause can be determined, then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective, or in the case of ''food allergies'' or ''drug allergy'', strict avoidance would be necessary. There are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. There are tests available to identify this type of hives.''Physical urticaria (for example, heat hives) is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. Common environmental provocations such as sunlight (solar urticaria), water, cold, heat, ''exercise'', and pressure occasionally induce hives. Dermatographism, which literally means ""skin writing,"" is a common cause of physical urticaria. This is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed; a red welt appears at the site of the scratch. In dermatographism, raised, itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin, causing mast cells to leak histamine.''Another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. This produces hundreds of small, itchy ''bumps''. These occur within 15 minutes of ''exercise'' or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. This form of hives happens more often in young people.' "
Are there conditions or other causes that mimic hives?,"'There are other ''rashes'' that may look like hives, but the fact that they remain stable and do not resolve within 24 hours is helpful in distinguishing them from hives. Such ''rashes'' may need to have a small specimen of skin removed and examined under the microscope (biopsy) to accurately determine the nature of the skin disease.''If hives are making it difficult to ''sleep'', then it may be necessary to see a physician. This would be especially important if you are taking nonprescription antihistamines. If your hives last longer than two months, it is also likely you will benefit from visiting a physician.' "
What specialists treat hives?,'Some family physicians or internists may feel comfortable caring for patients with chronic urticaria. Most dermatologists and allergists are able to care for patients with urticaria.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose and evaluate chronic urticaria?,"'Blood tests, including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR, a marker of inflammation), are all that is typically recommended for evaluation.' "
What are hives treatment options and home remedies?,"'The goal of treating most cases of ordinary acute urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. The most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines, which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. The main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness.''Many antihistamines are available without prescription, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), taken in doses of 25 milligrams, and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. These can be taken up to three times a day, but because these medications can cause drowsiness, they are often taken at bedtime. Those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration.''Loratadine'' (''Claritin'', 10 milligrams) and ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra'') are antihistamines available over the counter that are less likely to cause drowsiness (non-sedating). Also approved for ''over-the-counter'' use is ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax, ''Vistaril''), which causes drowsiness, and its breakdown product, ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'', 10 milligrams), which is less sedating.''Antihistamines that require a prescription include ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''), which tends to cause drowsiness. A prescription ''antihistamine'' that causes little sedation is levocetirizine (Xyzal). Sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called H2 blockers, such as ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') and ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''). This antihistamine list is not exhaustive. Physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response.''Oral steroids (''prednisone'', [''Medrol'']) can help severe cases of hives in the short term, but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. Other treatments have been used for urticaria as well, including ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ultraviolet ''radiation'', antifungal antibiotics, agents that suppress the immune system, and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (''amitriptyline'' [''Elavil'', ''Endep''], ''nortriptyline'' [''Pamelor'', Aventyl], ''doxepin'' [Sinequan, Adapin]). Evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. In ordinary cases, they are rarely needed. A new treatment now indicated for chronic urticaria is the monthly subcutaneous injection of a monoclonal antibody, ''omalizumab'' (''Xolair''), directed against the IgE receptor on human mast cells.''Topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. They include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce ''itching''. Some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor, menthol, diphenhydramine, and ''pramoxine''. Many of these topical preparations require no prescription. Cortisone-containing creams (steroids), even strong ones requiring a prescription, are not very helpful in controlling the ''itch'' of hives.''Applying cool compresses may help soothe the itch of an urticarial\xa0''rash''.'  "
What is the prognosis of hives?,"'To know exactly what kind of hives one has, or to learn more about research into the immune basis of hives or about rarer forms of this condition, consult a physician. It is important, however, to keep in mind that most cases of urticaria are annoying, not serious, and almost always temporary.' "
What is hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare hereditary disease that causes swelling with fluid accumulation of the skin and tissues just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue). The disease is unique in each individual. How often the swelling occurs and how severe it is along with its location is variable. If the swelling occurs in throat tissue, it can cause a medical emergency as breathing could be inhibited or stopped by swollen tissue.' "
What are the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'The main symptom of hereditary angioedema is swelling of the skin that does not cause ''itching'"" that is experienced intermittently. Symptoms last about 2 to 5 days and then slowly decrease. Although people are born with a genetic defect, the symptoms start in childhood and worsen during teenage years. Many people don't know they have HAE until they are diagnosed in adulthood.""'These symptoms may occur with hereditary angioedema:'  Swelling of the skin (note that above symptoms may occur before swelling begins) Extreme fatigue or tiredness Headache Muscle aches Tingling in the skin Abdominal or belly pain (may be extreme enough to lead to surgical exploration) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Hoarseness Shortness of breath Mood changes Swelling of the hands and feet Laryngeal edema that can actually result in asphyxiation Multiple reoccurrence of the above symptoms"
What are the types or forms of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'There are three forms or types of hereditary angioedema. They are distinguished by laboratory tests and genetic testing. The disease is inherited as autosomal dominant gene, meaning only one abnormal gene is required from a parent for the offspring to inherit the disease.' Type I HAE is caused by low levels of C1 inhibitor protein. Type II HAE is characterized by normal or elevated levels of dysfunctional C1 inhibitor protein. Type III is identified as an estrogen-dependent form of angioedema occurring mainly in women and is a result of mutations in the gene for coagulation factor XII."
What causes hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""The cause of hereditary angioedema is due to a problem with a gene that produces a protein termed C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). The problem with the autosomal dominant gene is that it does not produce enough C1 inhibitor (a protein that inhibits the complement system from self-activation) so that the body allows fluid to escape from tiny blood vessels into many different areas. The swelling can occur very quickly almost anywhere in the person's body. In addition, there are various triggers that cause an individual to have an attack of hereditary angioedema (see the triggers section). Males and females have about a 50-50 chance of inheriting the disease if one of their parents has HAE."" "
What triggers hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Although some attacks of HAE may occur for no known reason, other attacks are caused by certain triggers. Some of the most common HAE triggers include:' Stress Anxiety Minor injuries Surgical procedures Dental procedures Illnesses (for example, colds, flu, pneumonia) Intermittent physical activities (using a lawn mower, starting a construction project, for example) Medications Menstrual periods Pregnancy Hormone therapy"
What about pregnancy and hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Females who are pregnant and have ''abdominal pain'' may be difficult to diagnose, but they can be treated with the same medications as other hereditary angioedema patients in consultation with her OB/GYN.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor and/or pediatrician can help manage hereditary angioedema, consultants in the specialties of genetics, internal medicine, allergists, immunologists, dermatologists and OB/GYN are frequently consulted."" "
How is hereditary angioedema (HAE) diagnosed?,"'Hereditary angioedema is sometimes difficult to diagnose because of the irregularity of attacks and because some symptoms mimic other diseases. Patients that have a parent with hereditary angioedema have a good possibility of inheriting the disease (about 50%), so the family genetics history is part of the diagnostic workup if hereditary angioedema is suspected. A serum C4 level is considered a reliable and cost-effective screening test for hereditary angioedema as it is almost always decreased during attacks, and usually is low in between attacks. In addition, the three types of HAE are characterized by genetic testing and by blood tests of complement levels such as C1, C2, and C4. Ultrasound, CT scan and X-rays may show fluid accumulation in various tissues.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'The World Allergy Organization (WAO) issued the these guidelines for HAE Types I and II in 2013:'  Assess all patients suspected of having HAE-I/II for blood levels of C4, C1 esterase inhibitor (C-INH) protein, and C1-INH function. Consider on-demand treatment for all hereditary angioedema attacks that (1) result in debilitation/dysfunction and/or (2) involve the face, neck, or abdomen. Attacks affecting the upper airways must be treated. Treat all hereditary angioedema attacks as early as possible with C1-INH, Kalbitor (ecallantide), or Firazyr (icatibant); do not use oral anti-fibrinolytics as on-demand treatment. Consider intubation or tracheotomy early in progressive upper airway edema. Administer adjuvant therapy in hereditary angioedema attacks when indicated, but use specific therapies without delay when indicated. All HAE-I/II patients should have on-demand treatment for two attacks and carry their on-demand treatment at all times. Plasma-derived C1-INH is the preferred on-demand therapy for HAE-I/II attacks in children and for pregnant females or women who are breastfeeding.  All individuals with HAE should have an action plan, product available to treat HAE attacks, and an HAE identification card. Self-administration of treatment should be taught to all individuals whom are licensed for self-administration to give or be given on-demand treatment of HAE. All individuals with HAE should have at least one annual assessment by an HAE specialist."
How can a person with hereditary angioedema (HAE) avoid triggers and manage the disease?,"""In addition, the WAO's 2013 recommendations regarding prophylaxis, and screening in hereditary angioedema are:"" Consider administering short-term pre-procedural prophylaxis, particularly in cases involving dental/intraoral surgery, bronchoscopy or endoscopy, endotracheal intubation, or manipulation of the upper airway or pharynx. Before beginning long-term prophylaxis with androgens, a person with HAE should be assessed for cardiac risk factors, and obtain a complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, liver function test results, lipid profile, and liver ultrasonography. During the use of androgens for long-term prophylaxis, and for 6 months after cessation of therapy, the person's CBC, urine analysis, lipid profile, liver function test results, and blood pressure should be monitored every 6 months, and an annual ultrasonography of the liver should be performed. Defer screening children for HAE-I/II until the age of 12 months. Test all offspring of an affected parent. Family members of people with HAE (I or II) should be screened so that appropriate therapy can be available for treatment. People with HAE-I/II receiving blood products including Plasma-derived C1-INH should receive a hepatitis A and B vaccination. All individuals with HAE-I/II should receive an influenza vaccine. Guidelines are subject to change as newer drugs and modifications of treatment protocols are made available. People with HAE are urged to discuss their treatments and treatment changes, if any, with their health-care professional(s)."
Tips for managing and living with hereditary angioedema (HAE),"""Parents of children and teenagers should discuss their child's diagnosis with all family members and caregivers so that they are well-informed about the disease. It especially important to know what to do if there's any swelling in the throat because that constitutes a medical emergency."" Share your medical history (especially that you have HAE) with emergency medical responders, because it could be lifesaving. Symptoms like laryngeal swelling mimic allergic responses, and medications such as epinephrine or cortisone, commonly used to treat allergic reactions, have little or no effect on hereditary angioedema-induced laryngeal swelling. As stated by the WHO previously, people with hereditary angioedema should carry with them two treatments for acute HAE attacks at all times. It may be useful to keep a notebook about hereditary angioedema attacks so that you or your child can begin to identify triggers that precipitate HAE. As previously noted there are some common triggers (surgery, dental procedures, for example) of HAE. Consequently, it is possible to prophylactically treat people with HAE in advance of these potential triggers to avoid a hereditary angioedema attack. Remember that it is possible to recognize some symptoms that occur in some individuals just before an HAE attack starts. Recognizing those symptoms in an individual can allow them to treat themselves immediately to stop or lessen symptoms of HAE. Once diagnosed with hereditary angioedema, with the help of their health-care professional(s), people with HAE and/or their family members may be put in contact with others that have the same diagnosis, and they may learn other ways people with HAE have developed to manage their disease."
What are the complications of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""The most dangerous complication of hereditary angioedema is laryngeal edema, which can result in a rapidly advancing shortness of breath to complete airway obstruction within a few hours. Other complications can include visual disturbances, difficulty walking, and even some scarring in areas where the swelling has cut off or decreased blood flow to the body's tissues."" "
What is the prognosis for a person with hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'There is no known cure for hereditary angioedema. The prognosis for an individual with hereditary angioedema ranges from good to fair. Those who are undiagnosed have a poorer prognosis as they may receive treatments for symptoms of hereditary angioedema that simply are not effective. Once diagnosed, better awareness of their disease process and current medications allow optimal control and/or management of symptoms. Research in hereditary angioedema is ongoing (see reference 2).' "
What is a coronary angiogram?,"'An angiogram is an X-ray image of blood vessels after they are filled with a contrast material. An angiogram of the ''heart'', a coronary angiogram, is the ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of ''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD''). A coronary angiogram can be used to identify the exact location and severity of CAD.' "
How is a coronary angiogram performed?,"'Coronary angiography'' is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not significantly uncomfortable.' In performing a coronary angiogram, a doctor inserts a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) through the skin into an artery in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries (the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart). Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing iodine, which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. The procedure takes approximately 20-30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is either sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. Often, if an angioplasty orstent is indicated, it will be performed as part of the same procedure."
What does a coronary angiogram demonstrate?,"'Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary artery blockages. For patients with severe ''angina'' or ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for CAD (such as ''stress'' tests), the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment. Treatments may then include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary stenting, atherectomy (""roto-rooter""), or ''coronary artery bypass'' surgery.'  "
What is angiomyolipoma?,"'Angiomyolipomas are common benign (noncancerous) tumors of the kidney composed of three types of cells: vascular cells, immature smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. These benign tumors are mainly found in the kidney, but they can also be found occasionally in the ''liver'', and rarely in the ovary, Fallopian tube, spermatic cord, palate, and colon.''Older medical literature may refer to angiomyolipomas as hamartomas or choristomas. This article will mainly describe angiomyolipoma as related to the kidneys although very infrequently, angiomyolipomas may occur in other organs.' "
What are angiomyolipoma causes and risk factors?,"'The exact cause of angiomyolipoma is not known. Researchers suggest that the cause of these benign tumors is a mutation in a common progenitor cell (for example, a stem cell that has the potential to develop into any of the three types of cells listed above). Angiomyolipoma tumors are associated with the ''inherited'' ''genetic disease'' tuberous sclerosis (a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and other organs) and possibly associated with other syndromes like Sturge-Weber syndrome or ''neurofibromatosis''. Animal experiments suggest that a high-fat, low carbohydrate ''diet'"" may hasten growth and development of angiomyolipoma tumors in rats, but it's unknown if such a ""'diet'' will hasten angiomyolipoma ''tumor'' development in humans.' "
What are angiomyolipoma symptoms and signs?,"'Most people with angiomyolipomas have no symptoms or signs. However, even though they are considered to be benign tumors, some can cause symptoms and signs and in patients if the tumor becomes large and/or if the blood vessels in the angiomyolipoma leak blood (rupture). In this case, the following symptoms and signs may occur:'  Sudden pain (back pain or flank pain) Nausea Vomiting Anemia Hypertension Chronic kidney disease Shock (about 20% of patients that show symptoms develop shock)"
How do doctors diagnose angiomyolipoma?,"'The preliminary diagnosis of angiomyolipoma is usually done either incidentally while the patient is undergoing imaging tests for other reasons or directly by ''ultrasound'', ''CT scan'', and/or ''MRI'' scan. Urologists, radiologists, and ''emergency medicine'' physicians are often the first doctors to suspect and/or diagnose these tumors. In addition, ob-gyn doctors may find such tumors while doing ultrasound studies on ''pregnant'' females; angiomyolipoma bleeding problems are rare but possible in ''pregnancy''.' "
What is the treatment for angiomyolipoma?,"'Angiomyolipoma can be treated by the drug everolimus (Afinitor) that works by blocking the human target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein to affect many processes involved in cell growth. Researchers suggest that even if asymptomatic, angiomyolipoma that grows to 3 cm or more in diameter should be treated. Another treatment is embolization (technique in which the blood vessels in an angiomyolipoma tumor are sealed off); this technique can be preventative and is suggested to be used in angiomyolipomas 4 cm in diameter or larger to reduce the risk of hemorrhage (vessel rupture). Patients with angiomyolipoma tumors that are small and asymptomatic should be routinely seen with follow-up visits and measurements of the angiomyolipoma tumor size as some may quickly develop a growth rate of up to about 4 cm per year.'  "
What is the prognosis of angiomyolipoma?,"""In general, the prognosis of angiomyolipoma is good as long as the tumors don't have dilated blood vessels or grow rapidly. However, the prognosis decreases if the tumor becomes very large or compromises the kidney's function so that it may need to be removed or the patient may require ""'dialysis''. In addition, if the patient develops a hemorrhage, the prognosis, if the patient is not diagnosed and quickly treated, is fair to poor.' "
Is it possible to prevent angiomyolipoma?,"'Although it is not possible to prevent angiomyolipomas from developing, it is possible to reduce the possibility that they can cause serious problems. For example, asymptomatic angiomyolipoma can be treated before they have a chance to come symptomatic, thus preventing angiomyolipoma symptoms and signs.' "
What is balloon angioplasty?,"'Balloon angioplasty'' of the coronary artery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), was introduced in the late 1970s. PTCA is a nonsurgical procedure that relieves narrowing and obstruction of the arteries to the muscle of the heart (coronary arteries). This allows more blood and oxygen to be delivered to the heart muscle. PTCA is now referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, as this term includes the use of balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices. Percutaneous coronary intervention is accomplished with a small balloon catheter inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist, and advanced to the narrowing in the coronary artery. The balloon is then inflated to enlarge the narrowing in the artery. When successful, percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve ''chest pain'' of ''angina'', improve the prognosis of individuals with unstable angina, and minimize or stop a ''heart attack'' without having the patient undergo open heart ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery.''In addition to the use of simple balloon angioplasty, the availability of stents, in a wire-mesh design, have expanded the spectrum of people suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention, as well as enhanced the safety and long-term results of the procedure. Since the early 1990\'s, more and more patients are treated with stents, which are delivered with a percutaneous coronary intervention balloon, but remain in the artery as a ""scaffold"". This procedure has markedly reduced the numbers of patients needing emergency CABG to below 1%, and particularly with the use of the new ""medicated"" stents (stents coated with medications that help prevent recurrence due to ''scar tissue''), has reduced the rate of recurrence of the blockage in the coronary artery (""restenosis"") to well below 10%. At present, the only patients treated with just balloon angioplasty are those with vessels less than 2mm (the smallest diameter stent), certain types of lesions involving branches of coronary arteries, those with ''scar'' tissue in old stents, or those who cannot take the antiplatelet blood thinners after the procedure.''Various ""atherectomy"" (plaque removal) devices were initially developed as adjuncts to percutaneous coronary intervention. These include''Such devices were initially thought to decrease the incidence of restenosis, but in ''clinical trials'' were shown to be of little additional benefit, and now are only used in selective cases as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (percutaneous artery intervention).' the use of the excimer laser for photoablation of plaque, rotational atherectomy (use of a high-speed diamond-encrusted drill) for mechanical ablation of plaque, and directional atherectomy for cutting and removal of plaque."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. ''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard, thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol, calcium, muscle cells, and connective tissue, which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries, a process called arteriosclerosis.''The arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', elevated ''cholesterol levels'', and ''diabetes''. Individuals are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women) or if they have a positive family history of coronary ''heart disease''.' Over time, arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50% to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle during exercise. Lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most people. However, some 25% of those with significant coronary artery narrowing experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia, or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. These people are said to have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90% to 99%, people often have angina at rest (unstable angina). When a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque, the artery may become completely blocked, causing death of a part of the heart muscles (heart attack, or myocardial infarction)."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ECC)'' is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can show changes indicative of ischemia or heart attack. Often, the EKG in individuals with coronary artery disease is normal at rest, and only becomes abnormal when heart muscle ischemia is brought on by exertion. Therefore, ''exercise'' treadmill or bicycle testing (''stress'' tests) are useful screening tests for those with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These ''stress'' tests are 60% to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant coronary artery disease.''If the stress tests are not diagnostic, a nuclear agent (Cardiolite or ''thallium'') can be given intravenously during stress tests. Addition of one of these agents allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies substantial artery narrowing in that region.''Stress ''echocardiography'' combines echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing. It is also an accurate technique for detecting coronary artery disease. When a significant narrowing exists, the heart muscle supplied by the narrowed artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and thallium stress tests are 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a person cannot undergo an ''exercise stress test'' because of neurological or arthritic difficulties, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart normally brought on by exercise. Heart imaging can be performed with either a nuclear camera or echocardiography.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is a technique that allows X-ray pictures to be taken of the coronary arteries. ''It is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing''. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of coronary arteries. ''Iodine'' contrast ""dye"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded. Coronary arteriography gives the doctor a picture of the location and severity of narrowed artery segments. This information is important in helping the doctor select medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''coronary artery bypass'' graft surgery (CABG) as the preferred treatment option.''A newer, less invasive technique is the availability of high speed '' CT ''coronary angiography''. While it still involves ''radiation'' and dye exposure, no catheters are needed in the arterial system, which does decrease the risk of the procedure somewhat. This modality has a more limited role, in that, it is less questionable than conventional angiography and cannot allow PCF to be done the same time. It is important to remember that the risk of serious complications from conventional coronary angiography is very low (well under 1%).'  "
What medications treat coronary artery disease?,"""Angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply, and also may partially dilate the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. Three commonly used classes of ""'drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'', and calcium blockers.''Examples of nitrates include:''Examples of beta blockers include:''Examples of calcium blockers include:''A newer fourth agent, ranolazine (Ranexa) is of value.''Many people benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. When significant ischemia still occurs, either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually performed, often followed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Individuals with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of heart attack. In addition to angina medications, they are given ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner, ''heparin''. A form of heparin, ''enoxaparin'' (''Lovenox''), may be administered subcutaneously, and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in those with unstable angina. Aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets, while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. Potent IV antiplatelet agents (""super aspirins"") are also available to help initially stabilize such individuals. While people with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications, they are often at risk for the development of ''heart attacks''. For this reason, many people with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography, and possible percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG.''Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation, stenting, or atherectomy. During percutaneous coronary intervention, a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or wrist. The artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. Under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy), a long, thin plastic tube, called a guiding catheter, is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the ''aorta''. A contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that X-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. A small diameter guide wire (0.014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. A balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. This balloon is then inflated for about one minute, compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. Balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure, to as much as 20 atmospheres. Finally, the balloon is deflated and removed from the body.''Intracoronary stents are deployed in either a self-expanding fashion, or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the stent is expanded and deployed, and the balloon is removed. The stent remains in place in the artery.''CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in those whose illness has not responded to medications and are not good candidates for PCI.' isosorbide (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), and transdermal nitrate patches. propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and metoprolol (Lopressor). nifedipine (Procardia, Adalat), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Isoptin SR, Covera-HS), diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac), and amlodipine (Norvasc). Atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire, and then activated in varying fashion, depending on the device chosen. CABG is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations, or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments which are not well-suited for percutaneous coronary intervention. CABG is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in people with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in those with significant narrowing in multiple arteries, especially in cases of decreased heart muscle pump function."
What are the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention, using balloons, stents, and/or atherectomy can achieve effective relief of coronary arterial obstruction in 90% to 95% of patients.''When stents are placed patients are started on aspirin as well as a second agent for up to a year or more depending on the type of stent. These agents are clopidogrel (''Plavix''), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) may be given as an IV agent when the stent is placed for patients who cant take pills.''To help prevent the process of thrombosis during or after percutaneous coronary intervention, aspirin is given to prevent platelets from adhering to the artery wall and stimulating the formation of ''blood clots''. Intravenous heparin or synthetic analogues of part of the heparin molecule is given to further prevent blood clotting; and combinations of nitrates and calcium blockers are used to minimize vessel spasm. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include:''The incidence of abrupt occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents, which essentially eliminate the problem of flow-limiting arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and spasm. The use of new intravenous ""super aspirins"", which alter platelet function at a site different from the site of aspirin-inhibition, have dramatically reduced the incidence of thrombosis after balloon angioplasty and stenting.''When despite these measures, a coronary artery cannot be ""kept open"" during percutaneous coronary intervention, emergency CABG surgery may be necessary. Before the advent of stents and advanced anti-thrombotic strategies, emergency CABG following a failed percutaneous coronary intervention was required in as many as 5% of patients. In the current era, the need for emergent CABG following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than 1% The overall acute mortality risk following percutaneous coronary intervention is less than one percent; the risk of a heart attack following percutaneous coronary intervention is only about 1% to 2%. The degree of risk is dependent on the number of diseased vessels treated, the function of the heart muscle, and the age and clinical condition of the patient.'   In a very small percentage of individuals, percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed because of technical difficulties. These difficulties usually involve the inability to pass the guide wire or the balloon catheter across the narrowed artery segments. The most serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention results when there is an abrupt closure of the dilated coronary artery within the first few hours after the procedure. Abrupt coronary artery closure occurs in 5% of patients after simple balloon angioplasty, and is responsible for most of the serious complications related to percutaneous coronary intervention. Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting (thrombosis) at the balloon site, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the balloon site. women, individuals with unstable angina, and individuals having heart attacks."
How long is the recovery time after percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Percutaneous coronary intervention is performed in a special room fitted with computerized X-ray equipment called a cardiac catheterization laboratory.''Patients are then brought to a monitored bed for observation.''Most patients are discharged home the day after percutaneous coronary intervention.''Patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after percutaneous coronary intervention to prevent future thrombotic events (for example, unstable angina or heart attack).''Exercise stress testing is sometimes done several weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation can involve a 12-week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Lifestyle changes can help to lower the chance of developing further coronary artery disease. These include:''Cholesterol reduction is often aided by the addition of medications which may not only lower cholesterol levels, but may offer protection against future ''heart attacks''.' Patients are mildly sedated with small amounts of diazepam (Valium), midazolam (Versed), morphine, and other sedative narcotics given intravenously. Patients may experience minor discomfort at the site of the puncture in the groin or the arm. Patients also may experience brief episodes of angina while the balloon is inflated, briefly blocking the flow of blood in the coronary artery. The percutaneous coronary intervention procedure can last from 30 minutes to two hours, but is usually completed within 60 minutes. The plastic catheters left in the artery are removed from the groin after four to 12 hours depending on how long blood thinning is needed to stabilize the opened artery. When these catheters are removed, the area is compressed by hand or with the aid of a mechanical clamp for about 20 minutes to prevent bleeding. In many instances, the artery in the groin may be sutured or ""sealed"" in the catheterization laboratory, and the catheters are immediately removed. This enables the patient to sit up in bed within a few hours after the procedure. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds or perform vigorous exertion for the first one to two weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention. This allows the area in the coronary artery as well as the groin or arm arteries to heal. Patients may return to normal work and sexual activity two or three days after percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients who receive stents, an additional anti-platelet agent [in most instances clopidogrel (Plavix)] is given in conjunction with aspirin for one year; this is because the metal in the stents may promote the formation of blood clots after the stent is inserted. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the long-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention?,"'Long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention depend on the maintenance of the newly-opened coronary artery(ies).''Restenosis can simply be observed or treated with medications if the narrowing is not critical and the patient is not symptomatic.'   Thirty percent to 50% of patients with successful balloon angioplasty (no stent) may develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of the balloon inflation, usually within six months following percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients may complain of recurrence of angina or may have no symptoms. Restenosis is often detected by exercise stress tests performed at 4 to 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Restenosis occurs with a significantly higher frequency in people with diabetes. The rate of restenosis is greater in vein grafts, at the origins of vessels, in the beginning part of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in those with suboptimal initial results. The widespread use of intracoronary stents has reduced the incidence of restenosis by as much as 50% or more; this is due to prevention of ""elastic recoil"" in the artery, as well as providing a larger initial channel in the treated artery. With the newer medicated stents, the restenosis rate is well under 10%. Some patients undergo a repeat percutaneous coronary intervention to increase coronary artery blood flow. Second percutaneous coronary intervention procedures have similar initial and long-term results as first procedures, although certain patterns of restenosis have a very high repeat recurrence rate. Sometimes, CABG surgeries are recommended for those patients who have developed more extensive disease in the restenosed artery as well as in the other coronary arteries. Patients may also choose CABG surgery to avoid the uncertainty of restenosis after the second percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with restenosis after balloon angioplasty or stents, the use of intracoronary radiation (brachytherapy) may reduce the risk of future restenosis. If no evidence of restenosis is observed after 6 to 9 months, studies have demonstrated that the treated arterial segment is likely to remain open for many years. ""Late restenosis"" after 1 year or more is very uncommon. Symptoms developing more than 1 year after successful percutaneous coronary intervention are usually due to blockage in a different segment of the artery or in a different artery from that which was treated in the initial percutaneous coronary intervention."
Facts you should know about a dislocated ankle," An isolated dislocated ankle is a rare injury. Usually, there is an associated fracture of the bones that make up the ankle. The ankle usually dislocates as a result of a fall, motor-vehicle crash, or sporting injury causing damage to ligaments and bones. In addition to the bony injury, there can be damage to blood vessels, nerves, and skin. The diagnosis is often made clinically. The emergency treatment is to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible and then splint the ankle to prevent further damage. Orthopedic or podiatric consultation is usually required since surgery may be required depending upon the patient's situation. Arthritis is a common complication of an ankle dislocation. Most dislocated ankles result from accidental injury and are difficult to prevent."
What is a dislocated ankle?,"'The ankle is a hinge joint that connects the lower leg to the foot. The tibia and fibula of the leg come into contact with the talus of the foot, forming the ankle mortise. The majority of the weight bearing in the ankle occurs between the tibia and talus. While the shape of the mortise helps align the ankle joint, the surrounding ligaments are very important in providing stability.''A dislocated joint describes the situation where the bones that come together to form a joint no longer maintain that normal relationship. In the ankle, it means that the tibia and talus no longer maintain their normal anatomic relationship.''Most commonly, a dislocated ankle is associated with ''fractures'' of the distal ends of the tibia and fibula (called the malleolus) in association with damage to the ligaments that help support the ankle joint. Less commonly, isolated ligament injuries can result in the dislocation.' "
What are causes and risk factors for an ankle dislocation?,"'Ankle dislocations do not happen spontaneously but are a result of a ''trauma''. Forces are placed on the ankle that cause the bones to ''fracture'' or the ligaments to tear, resulting in the dislocation injury.''The ankle is an inherently stable joint and the direction of the dislocation depends upon the position of the foot and where the force arises. Ankle dislocations are more often associated with ''fractures'' of the bones that make up the joint.''Common causes of dislocations include falls, motor-vehicle crashes, and sports injuries.''The most common type of ankle dislocation is posterior, where the talus moves backward in relation to the tibia. For this to occur, the foot needs to be plantar flexed (the toes are pointing downward) when the injury occurs. The ankle is either forced inward from the outside (inversion) or outward from the inside (eversion), tearing the ligaments and tissues that hold the ankle stable.''Anterior dislocations, where the talus is pushed forward, occur when the foot is fixed or dorsiflexed (where the toes are pointed upward). The force from in front of the foot pushes the tibia backward.''Lateral dislocations occur when the ankle is twisted, either inverted or everted, but there are always fractures associated with either the medial or lateral malleolus or both.'""Superior dislocation describes where the talus is jammed upward, into the space between the tibia and fibula, as a result of an axial loading injury and is called a pilon injury. This may be due to landing on one's ""'feet'' from a fall or from being in a car wreck where the foot is held firm against the brake pedal.' "
What are dislocated ankle symptoms and signs?,"'Dislocations are ''painful'', and there is usually obvious deformity of the ankle joint. It may be very difficult or ''impossible to stand or walk''.''If the nerves that run across the ankle joint are damaged or inflamed, there can be numbness and ''tingling of the foot''.''There is almost immediate swelling of the ankle joint area and ecchymosis (''bruising'') may occur quickly.''Depending upon the mechanism of injury, there can be associated other injuries of the foot, knee, or spine.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a dislocated ankle?,"'It is important for the health care professional to take a history as to how the injury occurred. Appreciating the mechanism helps makes sense of the injury and may help direct treatment. Past medical history and previous ankle injury may provide useful information.''The dislocated ankle is often diagnosed clinically by the appearance of the ankle. Physical examination can determine the abnormal relationship of the tibia, fibula, and talus. In addition to the ankle, the health care professional may also exam the structures of the foot and knee, looking for other potential associated injuries.''Because blood vessels and nerves can become stretched and damaged when the ankle dislocates, pulses and sensation in the foot are evaluated. Skin complications are common because as the skin stretches over a bony prominence when the ankle is dislocated, it can lose its blood supply and die.''X-ray is the initial diagnostic test used to determine the extent of injury, where the bones are in relation to each other and whether a fracture is present. Once the dislocation is reduced and the bones realigned, another post-reduction X-ray may be done to confirm that realignment is good (bones in normal position). Depending upon the situation, ''CT'' or ''MRI'' scans might be considered to evaluate damage to the joint surface, to look for occult or hidden fractures, and to assess the ligaments and tendons that surround and stabilize the ankle joint.' "
What is the treatment for a dislocated ankle?,"'Once the initial evaluation is complete, the goal of emergency treatment of an ankle dislocation begins with trying to reduce the injury, returning the bones as close as possible to their normal anatomic position. Often the bones will fall back into place with gentle traction. Sometimes medication is required to sedate the patient and help the surrounding muscles relax.''If there is evidence that the blood and nerve supply to the foot are in jeopardy or if the skin is tented and stretched and the clinical diagnosis of ankle dislocation is made, attempts to reduce the ankle joint may be necessary even before an X-ray is taken to preserve nerve and blood vessel function.''Once the ankle is reduced, examination of the blood and nerve supply to the foot is repeated and a temporary plaster or fiberglass splint is placed.''An orthopedic or podiatric consultation may need to occur emergently, especially if there are unstable fractures present, if nerve or artery damage exists, or if the ankle cannot be reduced and an emergency operation is needed.''Even if the ankle dislocation is reduced, many times an operation is eventually required to stabilize the structures that were damaged. The decision as to whether surgery is required and what type of surgery might be needed is individualized for each patient and their situation.'  "
What is the recovery time for a dislocated ankle?,"'After the initial treatment is complete, whether or not surgery is required, rehabilitation may take six to 12 weeks before returning the patient to their pre-injury activities.' "
What is the prognosis of an ankle dislocation?,"'While the goal for every injury is to return the patient to their pre-injury level of function, patients who have dislocated their ankle may not necessarily be able to achieve that goal.''When the ankle dislocates, blood supply to the cartilage that lines the bone within the joint may be damaged, eventually leading to ''arthritis'' (arthro=joint + it is=inflammation). As well, if the bones do not perfectly align after injury, the risk of arthritis in the future increases.''Arthritis of the joint may cause ''pain'' and ''stiffness''. Loss of range of motion in the ankle can alter gait, the motion of ''walking'', and subsequently affect other parts of the skeleton including the hips and back.' "
Is it possible to prevent a dislocated ankle?,"'A dislocated ankle is an accidental injury and most often cannot be prevented.''The risk factors are few:' Recurrent sprained ankles that cause the joint to be lax Weakness of the muscles that surround and support the ankle, especially the peroneal muscle Diseases that cause joints to be hypermobile (for example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Down syndrome)"
What is ankle pain?,"'The ankle is a ""hinged"" joint capable of moving the foot in two primary directions: away from the body (plantar flexion) and toward the body (dorsiflexion). It\'s anatomy is formed by the meeting of three bones. The end of the shinbone of the leg (tibia) and a small bone in the leg (fibula) meet a large bone in the foot, called the talus, to form the ankle. The end of the shinbone (tibia) forms the inner portion of the ankle, while the end of the fibula forms the outer portion of the ankle. The hard, bony knobs on each side of the ankle are called the malleoli. These provide stability to the ankle joints, which function as weight-bearing joints for the body during standing and ''walking''.''Ligaments on each side of the ankle also provide stability by tightly strapping the outside of the ankle (lateral malleolus) with the lateral collateral ligaments and the inner portion of the ankle (medial malleolus) with the medial collateral ligaments. The ankle joint is surrounded by a fibrous joint capsule. Tendons that attach the large muscles of the leg to the foot wrap around the ankle both from the front and behind. The large tendon (Achilles tendon) of the calf muscle passes behind the ankle and attaches at the back of the heel. A large tendon of the leg muscle (posterior tibial tendon) passes behind the medial malleolus. The peroneal tendon passes behind the lateral malleolus to attach into the foot.''The normal ankle has the ability to move the foot, from the neutral right-angle position to approximately 45 degrees of plantar flexion and to approximately 20 degrees of dorsiflexion. The powerful muscles that move the ankle are located in the front and back portions of the leg. These muscles contract and relax during walking.' "
What are associated symptoms and signs of ankle pain and ankle tendinitis?,"'Symptoms and signs of ankle ''pain'' and ankle tendinitis include' pain, stiffness, swelling, discoloration, redness, warmth, tenderness, throbbing, and looseness of the joint."
What causes ankle pain and ankle tendinitis?,'Both ankle pain and ankle tendinitis can be caused by injuries (such as sprains and ''strains'' from sports) or diseases and conditions (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or ''gout'').' 
"What injuries can cause ankle pain, 
and how are they treated?","'Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. Sprains are injuries to the ligaments of the ankle, causing them to partially or completely tear as a result of sudden stretching. A sprain can occur on either or both of the inner and outer portions of the ankle joint. Ankle sprains more commonly happen when there is a preexisting muscle ''weakness'' in the ankle area or a history of previous ankle injuries. The typical injury occurs when the ankle is suddenly ""twisted"" in a sports activity or by stepping off an uneven surface. The pain is initially severe and can be associated with a ""popping"" sensation. Immediate swelling over the area of injury often occurs as the injured blood vessels leak fluid into the local tissue. Examination of the area may cause severe pain when the ankle is moved. The degree of pain may not necessarily indicate the degree of damage to the ligament(s). Ligament injuries are often graded from I to III, ranging from partial to complete tears. Partial tears retain some ankle stability, whereas complete tears lose stability because the strapping ligaments no longer brace the ankle joint. After an examination, significant ankle sprains are commonly evaluated with an X-ray. ''X-rays'' can determine whether there is an accompanying break (''fracture'') of the bone. Ankle ''fractures'' can occur without significant trauma in people with weak bones, such as from ''osteoporosis''. Sometimes these fractures are tiny ''stress'' fractures along the bone. These are typically associated with pain and tenderness.''Acute ankle sprains are initially treated with ice, rest, and limiting the amount of walking and weight-bearing on the injured ankle. The leg can be elevated to reduce swelling, and crutches are often recommended to avoid further trauma to the injured ligaments. Anti-inflammatory medications can be given to reduce local inflammation. Ice packs help decrease further swelling of the area and can reduce pain. Patients with severe injuries are placed in immobilization casts. Surgical repair of grade III injuries is considered, especially for those patients contemplating future athletic participation. Physical therapy programs are part of the rehabilitation process, incorporating strengthening exercises of the lower leg muscles. Broken ankles (fractures) can accompany ankle sprains or occur without sprains. Fractures are repaired with casting to immobilize the bone for healing. Depending on the severity, fractures can require orthopedic casting, or surgical procedures including pinning, and open repair of the ''fractured bone''.''With severe ankle injury, such as from a motor vehicle accident, dislocation of the ankle joint can occur. ''Ankle dislocation'' is a serious injury and generally requires a surgical repair. A ''dislocated ankle'' occurs when there is complete damage and disruption of the ligaments that support the ankle joint.''Tendinitis (also referred to as tendonitis) is inflammation of the tendon. Tendinitis of the ankle can involve the Achilles tendon, the posterior tibial tendon, or the peroneal tendon. Ankle tendinitis usually results from trauma, such as from sudden injury in sports or overuse injury as from ''running'' but can result from underlying inflammatory diseases or illnesses such as ''reactive arthritis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and ''ankylosing spondylitis''. All forms of tendinitis cause pain, swelling, and tenderness in the tendon area involved. The onset may be rapid, such as with an athletic injury. Immediate treatment of tendinitis involves immobilizing the area, elevation, and limiting weight-bearing, applying ice, and using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') to decrease inflammation. NSAIDs such as ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn'') or ''ketoprofen'' (Orudis) are commonly used for this purpose. More severe inflammation can require orthopedic casting. Athletic participation should be limited when the tendon is still inflamed, as there is a significant risk of rupturing or tearing the tendon, especially in the Achilles area, with continued athletic activity. ''Achilles tendon rupture'' more frequently occurs in patients who have had previous Achilles tendon inflammation. When the Achilles tendon ruptures, it usually requires orthopedic surgical repair.'  "
What diseases and conditions cause ankle pain? How are they treated?,"'Inflammatory types of ''arthritis'' (inflammation of the joint) that can involve the ankle area include ''rheumatoid arthritis'', reactive arthritis, ''gouty arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''psoriatic arthritis'', among others. They generally are not induced by traumatic injury and often develop gradually. A thorough evaluation by a doctor with blood testing can be necessary for ultimate diagnosis. These types of arthritis are associated with pain, swelling, stiffness, redness, and warmth in the involved area. These diseases each have unique management as described elsewhere.''Other conditions of the ankle which can cause ankle pain include ''tarsal tunnel syndrome''. This is a result of ''nerve compression'' at the ankle as the nerve passes under the normal supportive band surrounding the ankle called the flexor retinaculum. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is described elsewhere.''Infections of the ankle joint are rare. They most commonly occur as a result of bacteria being introduced into the ankle joint through ''puncture wounds'' or trauma. They also occur with a breakdown of the skin over the ankle as a result of ulcerations or abrasions. Patients with impaired immune systems such as those with ''AIDS'', or other immune diseases, are at an increased risk of infections in the joints, including the ankle. Also, patients with ''diabetes'' or those who take cortisone medications have an increased risk for ''bacterial infections'' of the joints. Bacterial joint infections are serious and require drainage and antibiotics, usually intravenously.''It is possible to develop viral infections of the ankle joints. In an isolated joint, such as the ankle, this most commonly occurs in children and is referred to as ""toxic synovitis."" It results in temporary ''joint inflammation'' and can be first noticed as subtle ''limping'' in the child. It is benign and resolves on its own with only symptomatic treatment, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), for relief of pain.'  "
How is the cause of ankle pain and ankle tendinitis treated?," Ankle pain and ankle tendinitis are diagnosed by a review the history of the pain, when it came on, if trauma or overuse occurred, and whether or not underlying diseases are present. An examination of the ankle joint is performed to determine if there is warmth, redness, swelling, tenderness, and/or looseness of the joint."
How long does it take for ankle pain and ankle tendinitis to heal?," The prognosis for ankle pain and ankle tendinitis depends on the specific injury. Most frequently, ankle pain resolves in days to weeks after injury. Sometimes chronic ligament damage at the ankle leads to looseness (laxity) of the joint that causes chronic ankle pain. If underlying disease is the cause of the ankle pain or ankle tendinitis, the outlook depends on its control."
Is it possible to prevent ankle pain and ankle tendinitis?,"'Just as sport activities and accidental trauma are risk factors for ankle pain and ankle tendinitis, they are also preventable situations.' Avoiding injury from sports by proper instruction and physical training can minimize the risk of developing ankle pain and ankle tendinitis. Stretching before working out is recommended. Sometimes ankle bracing or ankle taping can prevent ankle pain and ankle tendinitis. Decreasing the risks for accidental injury is also a method of preventing ankle injury."
What are the signs and symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'The symptoms of swollen feet and swollen ankles depend on the underlying causes mentioned above.'   In general, swelling caused by dependent edema, pregnancy, medications, and most diseases produce swelling that is bilateral (present in both feet or ankles ) and usually begins as a soft, puffy skin enlargement in the feet that spreads rapidly (often within hours) to the ankles. The skin is easily indented when pressed down with a finger and slowly returns to its more puffy state when the finger pressure is removed. Indentations seen in the puffy skin when shoes or socks are removed are classic signs of swelling. The skin color with this swelling is often normal or slightly pale; indentation marks are slightly darker than the surrounding swollen tissue. Many individuals can simply position themselves on their backs, elevate their feet and ankles higher than their hearts, and after some time (often a few hours), the swelling may resolve completely. However, in some chronic diseases and with some medications taken for long time periods, the swelling becomes chronic and the skin becomes more rigid, reddish and sometimes mildly discolored or mottled and will not return to normal after a few hours of elevation. For example, many people with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) will have chronic bilateral swelling of feet and ankles with skin changes."
What are common causes of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen ankles and swollen feet have numerous causes. Medically, the word ""swollen"" means protuberant or abnormally distended. Thus, if an ankle or foot is swollen, means it is increased in size. In most common situations, when the word swollen is used in reference to feet and ankles, the user implies the distention or size increase is due to an increase of fluid in the tissues (also termed edema). However, the broad definition includes any factors that increase ankle or foot size (for example increased or excess fluids, increased inflammatory cells or both). Because the majority of factors that cause foot swelling also may cause ankle swelling, this article will discuss swelling as a general topic to cover both foot and ankle swelling. Some of the few exceptions where only foot or ankle swelling occur without both being involved will be discussed. Swollen feet and ankles usually are a symptom or sign of some underlying problem, the majority of which are not a major cause for concern. However, in some instances, foot, ankle, and toes swelling may warn a person that an underlying problem needs immediate medical attention.''The causes of swollen feet and ankles are numerous; examples of the most of the major causes include:''Picture of ''pitting edema'   Dependent swelling (or edema): swelling due to standing or walking (usually over some time period that varies from person to person) Pregnancy: the normal swelling that most pregnant women experience during pregnancy Medications (side effects): Many medications have the side effects of fluid retention that manifests as swelling. Although the reader is advised to check their individual medications for side effects of swelling, general drug categories that may cause swelling include anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: Any trauma to the foot or ankle (usually sprains or fractures) can result in swelling. Diseases: heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any infection, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis) Lymphedema: swelling due to lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid Blood clot(s): blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue"
Who is at risk for swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'A large number of people are at risk for swollen ankles and feet. Below are listed the causes and those people at risk:' Dependent swelling (or edema): people who are standing or walking for long periods like salespersons, mothers with children, construction workers, obese individuals, and individuals with underlying health problems (see below) Pregnancy: most normal pregnant females, especially in the last trimester. Medications (side effects): people taking anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: any person with trauma to the foot or ankle Diseases: Patients with heart disease (especially congestive heart failure), liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any person infected, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis)of the foot or ankle Lymphedema: Persons with lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid, due to infections, trauma or surgical procedures Blood clot(s): People with blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue There are other causes that are less frequent and intermittent (for example, gout or hairline ankle fractures)."
What medical conditions cause symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Occasionally, ''specific medical problems'' will show additional or relatively unique symptoms, for example:''Injury or infection'' of the ankle is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral. Injury or infection is often, in the early stages, limited to either the foot or the ankle, but may spread to each other. Swelling due to trauma usually is localized to the injured area (for example, ''ankle sprain'' or ''plantar fasciitis'' in the foot); in some instances, the swollen skin area may be damaged by ''abrasion'', ''laceration'', or ''bruised''. ''Pain'' usually accompanies traumatic foot or ankle injury. Some infections of the foot or ankle may show localized swelling due to abscess formation (tight smooth skin, warm, and sometimes oozing pus) while other infections (cellulitis) show generalized swelling and warm skin, often with redness of the skin. ''Pain'' often is present where infection is located.' Symptoms of gout include swelling of the big toe with redness, warmth and pain, arthritis with swelling and joint pain, or electrolyte imbalance with low magnesium causing foot and leg cramps. Sudden appearance of bilateral feet and ankle swelling during pregnancy (usually after 20 weeks) can be the first symptoms noticed in females with preeclampsia. Unilateral swelling of the foot or ankle usually has the same symptoms described above if the underlying cause is unilateral lymphedema, venous insufficiency or blood clots. However, with blood clots there is often pain generated when the swollen area has pressure applied to the area. Chronic venous insufficiency often has skin changes in color and texture as described above but may also develop skin ulcers or secondary infections."
How do medical professionals diagnose swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"""Clinical observation and examination is the way swollen feet and ankles are diagnosed. A health care professional will likely ask questions about the swelling to obtain specific information and gain insight into the underlying cause of the swelling; once the cause is determined, treatments can be designed to help the patient. Simple observation and a patient's verbal description of the swollen area may be enough to presumptively diagnose the cause. For example:""'Laboratory tests are usually not used to diagnose feet and ankle swelling; however, they may be needed to be ordered in some patients to help diagnose underlying causes of the swelling. ''X-rays'' may be used to determine underlying fractures while ''CTs'' or ''MRI''s may reveal the extent of tissue damage.''Some mild hand and/or foot swelling can resolve without treatment, while other patients can be treated by their primary care doctors. Depending on the underlying cause of the swelling, such specialists as internal medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and cardiologists are some examples of specialists that may be consulted.' a swollen ankle that the patient ""twisted"" a day ago is probably due a sprain; a swollen foot that is warm with reddish skin in a person with diabetes, with a small cut on the foot is likely caused by an infection; a bilateral foot and ankle swelling in a cardiac patient who did not take the prescribed diuretics is probably caused by a combination of dependent edema, poor fluid management and decreased cardiac function."
What is the treatment for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The treatment for swollen feet and ankles depends on the underlying cause(s). For many people, simply raising their feet above their ''heart'' or simply getting off their feet regularly during the day will reduce or eliminate the swelling. However, for many other people, treatment of the underlying cause of the swelling may include antibiotics for infections, a splint or wrap for a sprain, taking appropriate medications for ''CHF'' or ''gout''.''Emergent and urgent treatment is infrequent for foot or ankle swelling itself, but does occur for certain underlying causes where feet and ankle swelling or localized swelling is an important symptom and sometimes the major symptom. Examples include''Anytime the swelling is accompanied by other major symptoms such as ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'' or ''fever'', a health care professional (emergency department or EMS) should be contacted immediately.'   preeclampsia in pregnancy, heart failure exacerbations, liver failure, kidney failure, foot and ankle fractures, abscesses, cellulitis, and gout exacerbations."
What home remedies help soothe symptoms of swollen ankles or feet?,"""One of the best home remedies for swollen ankles, feet, and toes is to elevate the swollen extremity slightly above the level of the heart. This is easily done by having the person lie down face up on a bed or couch, and then place pillows under the heels so the feet and ankles so they are higher than the person's chest.""'Sitting on a plane seat or on the office chair (or for hours at a time anywhere!) may cause lower extremity swelling. Periodic leg muscle movement by extension and contraction by simply by occasionally walking will help. Some physicians also recommend wearing support hose or compression stockings. Other suggestions are listed in the prevention section below.'  "
What are the complications of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen feet and ankles can lead to discomfort and pain when walking or ''running'' is attempted. Chronic swelling can lead to skin color changes and skin ulcers. The skin ulcers can occasionally become infected. The skin infections can be further complicated by abscess formation, cellulitis, ''necrotizing fasciitis'', and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'In many situations, the swelling in feet and ankles can be reduced or prevented. The following is a list of ways to reduce or prevent ankle and feet swelling:''Because there are so many underlying causes of feet and ankle swelling, there are numerous ways to avoid or reduce the chances for their development. The reader is urged to follow up on this article by reading about ways to prevent underlying causes of swelling.' Exercise to improve circulation and fluid distribution Eat a healthy diet; too much salt may cause fluid retention, high blood pressure (hypertension), and swelling Interrupt sitting or standing several times a day and elevate the feet and ankles above the heart Lose excess weight to lessen water retention and decrease the build-up of pressure on muscles and joints Consider using support stockings or hose Examine prescription and other medications; consult with the doctor if medication may be responsible for fluid retention Avoid smoking, alcohol and other substances that can lead to underlying causes of swelling"
What is the prognosis for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The majority of people with swollen feet and ankles have a good to excellent outcome because the swelling is usually reversible and has no lasting complications. However, a significant number of patients who have underlying causes that are chronic and refractory to treatment have a wider range of prognosis (good to poor) depending on how well the patient responds to both lifestyle changes and medications.' "
Facts you should know about ankylosing spondylitis," Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis featuring chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis). Ankylosing spondylitis belongs to a group of arthritis conditions that tend to cause chronic inflammation of the spine (spondyloarthropathies). Ankylosing spondylitis affects males two to three times more commonly than females. Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of back pain in adolescents and young adults. The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is genetically inherited. The HLA-B27 gene can be detected in the blood of most patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis can also affect the eyes, heart, lungs, and occasionally the kidneys. The optimal treatment of ankylosing spondylitis involves medications that reduce inflammation or suppress immunity, physical therapy, and exercise."
What is ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. The sacroiliac joints are located at the base of the low back where the ''sacrum'' (the bone directly above the tailbone) meets the iliac bones (bones on either side of the upper buttocks) of the pelvis. Chronic inflammation in these areas causes ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' in and around the spine, including the neck, middle back, lower back, and buttocks. Over time, chronic inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) can lead to a complete cementing together (fusion) of the vertebrae, a process referred to as ''ankylosis''. Ankylosis causes loss of mobility of the spine.''Ankylosing spondylitis is also a systemic disease, meaning it can affect tissues throughout the body, not just the spine. Accordingly, it can cause inflammation in and injury to other joints away from the spine manifest as arthritis, as well as to other organs, such as the eyes, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Ankylosing spondylitis shares many features with several other arthritis conditions, such as ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease), and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause disease and inflammation in the spine, other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine, these medical conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies."" Ankylosing spondylitis is considered one of the many rheumatic diseases because it can cause symptoms involving muscles and joints.'""Ankylosing spondylitis is two to three times more common in men than in women. In women, joints away from the spine are more frequently affected than in men. Ankylosing spondylitis affects all age groups, including children. When it affects children, it is referred to as juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. The most common age of onset of symptoms is in the second and third decades of life. Ankylosing spondylitis is often abbreviated AS and has been referred to as Bechterew's disease.""  "
What causes ankylosing spondylitis?,"'The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is believed to be genetically inherited, and a majority (nearly 90%) of people with ankylosing spondylitis are born with a gene known as the HLA-B27 gene. Blood tests have been developed to detect the HLA-B27 gene marker and have furthered our understanding of the relationship between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis. The HLA-B27 gene appears only to increase the tendency of developing ankylosing spondylitis, while some additional factor(s), perhaps environmental factors, are necessary for the disease to appear or become expressed. For example, while 7% of the United States population has the HLA-B27 gene, only 1% of the population actually has the disease ankylosing spondylitis. In northern Scandinavia (Lapland), 1.8% of the population has ankylosing spondylitis while 24% of the general population has the HLA-B27 gene. Even among individuals whose HLA-B27 blood test is positive, the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis appears to be further related to heredity. In HLA-B27-positive individuals who have relatives with the disease, the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis is 12% (six times greater than for those whose relatives do not have ankylosing spondylitis).''Other genes have been identified that are associated with ankylosing spondylitis, including ARTS1 and IL23R. These genes seem to play a role in influencing immune function. It is anticipated that by understanding the effects of each of these known gene risk factors medical researchers will make significant progress in discovering a cure for ankylosing spondylitis.'""How inflammation occurs and persists in different organs and joints in ankylosing spondylitis is a subject of active health research. Each individual tends to have their own unique pattern of presentation and activity of the illness. The initial inflammation may be a result of an activation of the body's immune system, perhaps by a preceding bacterial infection or a combination of infectious microbes. Once activated, the body's immune system becomes unable to turn itself off, even though the initial bacterial infection may have long subsided. Chronic tissue inflammation resulting from the continued activation of the body's own immune system in the absence of active infection is the hallmark of an inflammatory autoimmune disease."" "
What are ankylosing spondylitis symptoms and signs?,"'The ''symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis'' are related to inflammation of the spine, joints, and other parts of the body. ''Fatigue'' is a common symptom associated with active inflammation. Inflammation of the spine causes ''pain'' and stiffness in the low back, upper buttock area, neck, and the remainder of the spine. The onset of pain and stiffness is usually gradual and progressively worsens with loss of range of motion noticeable over months. Occasionally, the onset is rapid and intense (flare-up). ''Lumbar pain'' (''low back pain'') and ''buttock pain'' are common manifestations of active inflammation in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. The symptoms of pain and stiffness are often worse in the morning or after prolonged periods of inactivity. Motion, heat, and a warm shower often reduces pain and stiffness in the morning. Because ankylosing spondylitis often affects adolescents, the onset of ''low back pain'' is sometimes incorrectly attributed to athletic injuries in younger patients.''Those who have chronic, severe inflammation of the spine can develop a complete bony fusion of the spine (ankylosis). Once fused, the pain in the spine disappears, but the affected individual has a complete loss of spine mobility. These fused spines are particularly brittle and vulnerable to breakage (''fracture'') when involved in ''trauma'' such as motor-vehicle accidents. A sudden onset of pain and mobility in the spinal area of these patients can indicate bone breakage. The lower neck (cervical spine) is the most common area for such ''fractures''.''Chronic spondylitis and ankylosis cause forward curvature of the upper torso (thoracic spine), which limits ''breathing'' capacity. Spondylitis can also affect the areas where ribs attach to the upper spine, further limiting lung capacity. Ankylosing spondylitis can cause inflammation and scarring of the lungs, causing ''coughing'' and ''shortness of breath'', especially with ''exercise'' and infections. Therefore, breathing difficulty can be a serious complication of ankylosing spondylitis.''People with ankylosing spondylitis can also have arthritis in joints other than the spine. This feature occurs more commonly in women. Patients may notice pain, stiffness, heat, swelling, warmth, and/or redness in joints such as the hips, knees, and ankles. Occasionally, the small joints of the toes can become inflamed or ""sausage"" shaped. Inflammation can occur in the cartilage around the breastbone (''costochondritis'') as well as in the tendons where the muscles attach to the bone (tendinitis) and in ligament attachments to bone (''enthesitis''). Some people with this disease develop Achilles tendinitis, causing pain and stiffness in the back of the heel, especially when pushing off with the foot while ''walking'' upstairs. Inflammation of the tissues of the bottom of the foot, ''plantar fasciitis'', occurs more frequently in people with ankylosing spondylitis.''Other areas of the body affected by ankylosing spondylitis include the eyes, heart, and kidneys. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis can develop inflammation of the ''iris'' (''iritis''), the colored portion of the eye. Iritis is characterized by redness and pain in the eye, especially when looking at bright lights. Recurrent attacks of iritis can affect either eye. In addition to the iris, the ciliary body and choroid of the eye can become inflamed; this is referred to as ''uveitis''. Iritis and ''uveitis'"" can be serious complications of ankylosing spondylitis that can damage the eye and impair vision and may require an eye specialist's (ophthalmologist) urgent care. Special medical treatments for serious eye inflammation are discussed in the treatment section below. (It should be noted that iritis and inflammation of the spine can occur in other forms of arthritis such as ""'reactive arthritis'"" [formerly known as Reiter's syndrome], ""'psoriatic arthritis'', and the arthritis of ''inflammatory bowel disease''.)'""A rare complication of ankylosing spondylitis involves scarring of the heart's electrical system, causing an abnormally slow heart rate (referred to as ""'heart block''). A heart ''pacemaker'' may be necessary in these patients to maintain adequate heart rate and output. In others, the part of the ''aorta'' closest to the heart can become inflamed, resulting in leakage of the ''aortic valve''. In this case, patients can develop shortness of breath, ''dizziness'', and ''heart failure''.''Advanced spondylitis can lead to deposits of protein material called amyloid into the kidneys and result in ''kidney failure''. Progressive ''kidney disease'' can lead to ''chronic fatigue'' and ''nausea'' and can require removal of accumulated waste products in the blood by a filtering machine (''dialysis'').'  "
What specialties of health care professionals treat ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Health care professionals who treat ankylosing spondylitis include primary care doctors, internists, family practitioners, and general-medicine doctors, as well as orthopedists. ''Rheumatologists'' are internal-medicine subspecialists with a particular interest in diagnosing and treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis?,"""The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is based on evaluating the patient's symptoms, a physical examination, X-ray findings (radiographs), and blood tests. Stiffness, pain, and decreased range of motion of the spine are characteristic of the inflammatory ""'back pain'' of ankylosing spondylitis. Symptoms include pain and morning stiffness of the spine and sacral areas with or without accompanying inflammation in other joints, tendons, and organs. Early symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can be very deceptive, as stiffness and pain in the low back can be seen in many other conditions. It can be particularly subtle in women, who tend to (though not always) have more mild spine involvement. Years of disease can pass before the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is even considered.''The examination can demonstrate signs of inflammation and decreased range of motion of joints. This can be particularly apparent in the spine. Flexibility of the low back and/or neck can be decreased. There may be tenderness of the sacroiliac joints of the upper buttocks. Chest expansion with full breathing can be limited because of rigidity of the chest wall. Severely affected people can have a ''stooped posture''. Inflammation of the eyes can be evaluated by the doctor with an ophthalmoscope.''Further clues to the diagnosis are suggested by X-ray abnormalities of the spine and the presence of the genetic marker HLA-B27 identified by a blood test. Other blood tests may provide evidence of inflammation in the body. For example, a blood test called the ''sedimentation rate'' is a nonspecific marker for inflammation throughout the body and is often elevated in inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. X-ray tests of the sacroiliac joints can demonstrate signs of inflammation and erosion of bone. ''X-rays'' of the spine can progressively demonstrate straightening, ""squaring"" of the vertebrae, and end-stage fusion of one vertebra to the next (ankylosis). Fusion up and down the spine can lead to a ""bamboo spine"" appearance on X-ray tests with complete loss of mobility.''Urinalysis'' is often done to look for accompanying abnormalities of the kidney as well as to exclude kidney conditions that may produce ''back pain'' that mimics ankylosing spondylitis. Patients are also simultaneously evaluated for symptoms and signs of other related spondyloarthropathies, such as ''psoriasis'', ''venereal disease'"", dysentery (reactive arthritis or Reiter's disease), and ""'inflammatory bowel disease'' (''ulcerative colitis'"" or Crohn's disease).""  "
What are home remedies for ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Physical therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes instructions and exercises to maintain proper posture. This includes deep breathing for lung expansion and stretching exercises to improve spine and joint mobility. Since ankylosis of the spine tends to cause forward curvature (''kyphosis''), patients are instructed to maintain erect posture as much as possible and to perform back-extension exercises. Patients are also advised to ''sleep'' on a firm mattress and avoid the use of a pillow in order to prevent ''spine curvature''. Ankylosing spondylitis can involve the areas where the ribs attach to the upper spine as well as the vertebral joints, thus limiting breathing capacity. Patients are instructed to maximally expand their chest frequently throughout each day to minimize this limitation.''Physical therapists customize exercise programs for each individual. ''Swimming'"" often can be a very beneficial form of exercise, as it avoids jarring impact of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis need not limit an individual's involvement in athletics. People can participate in carefully chosen aerobic sports when their disease is inactive. ""'Aerobic exercise'' is generally encouraged as it promotes full expansion of the breathing muscles and opens the airways of the lungs.''Cigarette smoking'' is strongly discouraged in people with ankylosing spondylitis, as it can accelerate lung scarring and seriously aggravate breathing difficulties. Occasionally, those with severe lung disease related to ankylosing spondylitis may require oxygen supplementation and medications to improve breathing.''People with ankylosing spondylitis may need to modify their activities of daily living and adjust features of the workplace. For example, workers can adjust chairs and desks for proper postures. Drivers can use wide rearview mirrors and prism glasses to compensate for the limited motion in the spine.' "
What are ankylosing spondylitis treatment options?,"'The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis typically involves the use of medications to reduce inflammation and/or suppress immunity to stop progression of the disease, physical therapy, and exercise. Medications decrease inflammation in the spine and other joints and organs. Physical therapy and exercise help improve posture, spine mobility, and lung capacity.''Aspirin'' and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly used to decrease pain and stiffness of the spine and other joints. Commonly used NSAIDs include ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''). Their common side effects include stomach upset, ''nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and even bleeding ulcers. These medicines are frequently taken with food in order to minimize side effects.'""In some people with ankylosing spondylitis, inflammation of joints excluding the spine (such as the hips, knees, or ankles) becomes the major problem. Inflammation in these joints may not respond to NSAIDs alone. For these individuals, the addition of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that suppress the body's immune system is considered. These medications, such as\xa0""'sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine), may bring about long-term reduction of inflammation. An alternative to sulfasalazine that is somewhat more effective is ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), which can be administered orally or by injection. Frequent blood tests are performed during methotrexate treatment because of its potential for toxicity to the ''liver'', which can even lead to ''cirrhosis'', and toxicity to bone marrow, which can lead to severe ''anemia''.''Medical research has shown that for persistent ankylosing spondylitis with spinal involvement that is unresponsive to anti-inflammatory medications, both sulfasalazine and methotrexate are ineffective. Newer, effective medications for spine disease attack a messenger protein of inflammation called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF). These TNF-blocking medications have been shown to be extremely effective for treating ankylosing spondylitis by stopping disease activity, decreasing inflammation, and improving spinal mobility. Examples of these TNF-blockers include ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), and ''golimumab'' (''Simponi''). In 2016, adalimumab (Humira) was approved for the treatment of ''uveitis'' (inflammation in the eyes).''Several major points about the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis deserve emphasis. There is an early, underdiagnosed stage of spondylitis that occurs before plain X-ray testing can detect classic changes. Patients who are treated earlier respond better to treatments. Current disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and ''leflunomide'' (''Arava''), which can be effective for ''joint inflammation'' of joints away from the spine, are ''not'' effective for spinal inflammation. If nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not effective in a patient whose condition is dominated by spinal inflammation (and 50% do respond), then biologic medications that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF inhibitors) are used. All TNF inhibitors, including Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Simponi can be effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis. The improvement that results for TNF inhibition is sustained during years of treatment. If the TNF inhibitors are discontinued, for whatever reason, relapse of disease occurs in virtually all patients within a year. If TNF inhibitor is then resumed, it is typically effective.''Oral or injectable ''corticosteroids'' (cortisone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents and can effectively control spondylitis and other inflammations in the body. Unfortunately, corticosteroids can have serious side effects when used on a long-term basis. So they are typically used for short periods when possible. These side effects include ''cataracts'', thinning of the skin and bones (''osteoporosis''), ''easy bruising'', infections, ''diabetes'', and destruction of large joints, such as the hips.''Inflammation and diseases in other organs are treated separately. For example, inflammation of the iris of the eyes (iritis or uveitis) may require cortisone eyedrops (Pred Forte) and high doses of cortisone by mouth. Additionally, ''atropine'' eyedrops are often given to relax the muscles of the iris. Sometimes injections of cortisone into the affected eye are necessary when the inflammation is severe. ''Heart disease'' in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, such as heart block, may require a pacemaker placement or medications for ''congestive heart failure''.''Finally, orthopedic surgery may be required when there is severe disease of the hip joints and spine.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with ankylosing spondylitis?,"'The outlook for patients with ankylosing spondylitis is very much dependent upon the location and severity of its manifestations. The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility. Quitting ''smoking'' is essential for the best long-term outcome. It has been found that people with ankylosing spondylitis have somewhat of an increased health risk for ''coronary artery disease''. This increased risk appears to be caused by chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is important to optimize all modifiable cardiac risks, including elevated ''blood pressure'' and ''cholesterol''.'  "
Is it possible to prevent ankylosing spondylitis?,'There is no ''prevention'' for this inherited (genetic) disease. Prevention measures are directed toward preventing complications of the disease with optimal treatments and monitoring for side effects of the treatments. Exercise can help to maintain flexibility.' 
What is in the future for patients with ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Ankylosing spondylitis and each of the spondyloarthropathies are areas of active health research. The relationship between infectious agents and the triggering of chronic inflammation is vigorously being pursued. Factors that perpetuate ""autoimmunity"" are being identified. The characteristics of the gene marker HLA-B27 are being further defined. In fact, there are now known to be seven different subtypes of HLA-B27.''The impact of the recent discovery of the two additional genes, ARTS1 and IL23R, associated with ankylosing spondylitis (described above under ""Causes"") cannot be overstated. These genes seem to play a role in influencing immune function. It is anticipated that by understanding the effects of each of these known genes researchers will make significant progress in discovering a cure for ankylosing spondylitis.''As more about the precise mechanisms these genes use to influence the immune system is understood, the discovery of a cure will be possible. Moreover, results of ongoing research will lead to a better understanding and optimal treatment options of the entire group of diseases collectively known as spondyloarthropathies.' "
Where can people find more information about ankylosing spondylitis and learn about support groups?,"'For more information about ankylosing spondylitis, please visit the ''Arthritis Foundation'' (http://www.arthritis.org/) and contact local branches of the Arthritis Foundation and/or Spondylitis Association of America for support group information.' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is anorexia nervosa?,"'Anorexia nervosa, commonly referred to simply as anorexia, is one type of eating disorder. It is also a psychological disorder. Anorexia is a condition that goes beyond concern about ''obesity'' or out-of-control ''dieting''. A person with anorexia often initially begins dieting to ''lose weight''. Over time, the ''weight loss'"" becomes a sign of mastery and control. The drive to become thinner is actually secondary to concerns about control and/or fears relating to one's body. The individual continues the ongoing cycle of restrictive eating, often accompanied by other behaviors such as excessive exercising or the overuse of ""'diet'' pills to induce ''loss of appetite'', and/or diuretics, laxatives, or enemas in order to reduce body weight, often to a point close to starvation in order to feel a sense of control over his or her body. This cycle becomes an obsession and, in this way, is similar to an ''addiction''.'  "
Who is at risk for anorexia nervosa?,"'\tA majority of those affected by anorexia are female, most often teenage girls, but males can develop the disorder as well. While anorexia typically begins to manifest itself during early adolescence, it is also seen in young children and adults. Although the disorder has received a lot of media attention, it is an uncommon condition. Caucasians are more often affected than people of other racial backgrounds, and anorexia is more common in middle and upper socioeconomic groups.\xa0''\tMany experts consider people for whom thinness is especially desirable, or a professional requirement (such as athletes in sports like gymnastics, wrestling and jockeying, as well as models, dancers, and actors), to be at risk for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Health-care professionals are usually encouraged to present the facts about the dangers of anorexia through education of their patients and of the general public as a means of preventing this and other eating disorders.' "
What causes anorexia nervosa?,"'\tAt this time, no definite cause of anorexia nervosa has been determined. However, research within the medical and psychological fields continues to explore possible causes.''\tStudies suggest that a genetic (''inherited'"") component may play a more significant role in determining a person's susceptibility to anorexia than was previously thought. Researchers are attempting to identify the particular gene or genes that might affect a person's tendency to develop this disorder, and preliminary studies suggest that a gene located at chromosome 1p seems to be involved in determining a person's susceptibility to anorexia nervosa.""'\tOther evidence had pinpointed a dysfunction in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus (which regulates certain metabolic processes), as contributing to the development of anorexia. Other studies have suggested that imbalances in neurotransmitter (brain chemicals involved in signaling and regulatory processes) levels in the brain may occur in people suffering from anorexia.''\tFeeding problems as an infant, a general history of under-eating, and maternal depressive symptoms tend to be risk factors for developing anorexia. Other personal characteristics that can predispose an individual to the development of anorexia include a high level of negative feelings and perfectionism. For many individuals with anorexia, the destructive cycle begins with the pressure to be thin and attractive. A poor self-image compounds the problem. People who suffer from any eating disorder are more likely than others to have been the victim of childhood abuse.''\tWhile some professionals remain of the opinion that family discord and high demands from parents can put a person at risk for developing this disorder, the increasing evidence against the idea that families cause anorexia has mounted to such an extent that professional mental-health organizations no longer ascribe to that theory. Possible factors that protect against the development of anorexia include high maternal body mass index (''BMI'') as well as high self-esteem.' "
How is anorexia nervosa diagnosed?,"'Anorexia nervosa can be a difficult disorder to diagnose, since individuals with anorexia often attempt to hide the disorder. Denial and secrecy frequently accompany other symptoms. It is unusual for a person with anorexia to seek professional help because the individual typically does not accept that she or he has a problem (denial). In many cases, the actual diagnosis is not made until medical complications have developed. The individual is often brought to the attention of a professional by family members only after marked ''weight loss'' has occurred. When anorexics finally come to the attention of a health-care professional, they often lack insight into their problem despite being severely malnourished and may be unreliable in terms of providing accurate information. Therefore, it is often necessary to obtain information from parents, a spouse, or other family members in order to evaluate the degree of weight loss and extent of the disorder. Health professionals will sometimes administer symptom questionnaires as part of screening for the disorder.''Warning signs of developing anorexia or one of the other eating disorders include excessive interest in dieting or thinness.  One example of such interest includes a movement called ""thinspiration,"" which promotes extreme thinness as a lifestyle choice rather than as a symptom of illness.  There are a variety of web sites that attempt to inspire others toward extreme thinness by featuring information on achieving that goal, photos of famous, extremely thin celebrities, and testimonials, as well as before and after pictures of individuals who ascribe to extreme thinness.'""The actual criteria for anorexia nervosa are found in the American Psychiatric Association's ""'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V'').''There are three basic criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa that are characteristic:''The ''DSM-V'' further identifies two subtypes of anorexia nervosa. In the binge-eating/purging type, the individual regularly engaged in binge eating or purging behavior in at least the past three months, which involves self-induced ''vomiting'' or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode of anorexia. In the restricting type, the individual has severely restricted food intake and/or excessively exercised for at least the past three months but does not regularly engage in the behaviors seen in the binge-eating type.''In order to diagnose anorexia, the health-care professional distinguishes this illness from being a symptom of an underlying medical disorder or of another eating disorder.  As a symptom of a medical disorder, the term anorexia (in general, rather than anorexia nervosa, the condition discussed in this article) describes the considerable weight loss that may be the result of serious illness that may afflict terminally ill patients who are receiving ''hospice'' care.''  Unlike the binge-eating/purging type of anorexia nervosa, ''bulimia nervosa'' does not result in weight reduction below the minimal normal weight. ''Bulimia'' nervosa is characterized by episodes of eating significantly excessive amounts of food that the individual feels they cannot stop themselves from engaging in (binges), alternating with episodes of attempts to counteract the binges using inappropriate behaviors (purging) like self-induced ''vomiting'', misuse of medications, fasting, and/or excessive exercising. Most individuals with an eating disorder do not fit neatly into either the diagnosis of anorexia or ''bulimia'' and are therefore classified as either suffering from ""other specified feeding or eating disorder"" or ""unspecified feeding or eating disorder.""  Examples of other specified feeding or eating disorders include people with binge-eating disorder who experience episodes of binge eating but do not regularly engage in purging or restricting behaviors; individuals with recurrent purging behaviors without binge eating and recurrent episodes of night eating that is not better explained by ''binge eating disorder'' or another mental-health disorder.  Those eating disorders that do not meet diagnostic criteria for any specific eating disorder are classified as an ""unspecified feeding or eating disorder.""' Restriction of food intake that leads to markedly low body weight for age, 
	gender, developmental course and medical health An intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior 
that prevents weight gain, despite the person being significantly underweight Self-perception that is grossly distorted, excessive emphasis on body weight 
and shape in self-assessment, and weight loss or the seriousness thereof that is 
either minimized or not acknowledged completely"
What are anorexia symptoms and signs (psychological and behavioral)?,"""Anorexia can have dangerous psychological and behavioral effects on all aspects of an individual's life and can affect other family members as well.""'In addition to the mental effects of anorexia, physical effects of this disorder in children and ''teens'' include a number of issues that are associated with growth and development inherent in this age group. Examples of symptoms and signs of anorexia in childhood and adolescence can include a slowing of the natural increase in height or a slowed development of other body functions like menses.'""All of these features can negatively affect one's daily activities. Diminished interest in previously preferred activities can result or worsen. Some individuals also have symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder.""  The individual can become seriously 
underweight, which can lead to or worsen depression and social withdrawal. The individual can 
become irritable and easily upset and have difficulty interacting with others. Sleep can become 
disrupted and lead to fatigue during the day. Attention and concentration can decrease. Most individuals with anorexia become obsessed with food 
and thoughts of food. They think about it constantly and become compulsive about 
	their food choices or eating rituals. They may collect recipes, cut their food into tiny pieces, 
prepare elaborate calorie-laden meals for other people, or hoard food. 
Additionally, they may exhibit other obsessions and/or compulsions related to 
food, weight, or body shape that meet the diagnostic criteria for an 
	obsessive compulsive disorder. Other psychiatric problems are also common in people with anorexia nervosa, including affective (mood) disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Generally, individuals with anorexia are compliant in every other aspect of their life except for their relationship with food. Sometimes, they are overly compliant, to the extent that they lack adequate self-perception. They are 
	often eager to please and strive for perfection. They usually do well in school and may often overextend themselves in a variety of activities. The families of anorexics often appear to be ""perfect."" Physical appearances are important to the 
	anorexia sufferer. Performance in other areas is stressed as well, and they are often high achievers 
	in many areas. While control and perfection are critical issues for 
individuals with anorexia, aspects of their life other than their eating habits are often 
found to be out of control as well. Many have, or have had at some point in 
their lives, addictions to alcohol, drugs, or gambling. Compulsions involving 
sex, exercising, housework, and shopping are not uncommon. In particular, people 
with anorexia often exercise compulsively to speed the 
weight-loss process. Symptoms of anorexia in men tend to co-occur with other psychological problems and more commonly follow a period of being overweight than in women.  Men with anorexia also tend to be more likely to have a distorted body image. Compared to symptoms in men, symptoms of anorexia in women tend to more frequently include a general displeasure with their body and a possibly stronger desire to be thin.  Women with anorexia also tend to experience more perfectionism and cooperativeness."
"What are anorexia symptoms, signs, and complications (physical)?","'Most of the medical complications of anorexia nervosa result from starvation. Few organs are spared the progressive deterioration brought about by anorexia.'  Heart and circulatory system: Although usually not life-threatening, an abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia) and unusually low blood pressure (hypotension) are frequent manifestations of starvation and are commonly associated with anorexia. Of greater significance are disturbances in the heart rhythm (arrhythmia). A reduction in the work capacity of the heart is associated with severe weight loss and starvation. Gastrointestinal complications are also associated with anorexia. Constipation and abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. The rate at which food is absorbed into the body is slowed down. Starvation and overuse of laxatives can seriously disrupt the body's normal functions involved in the elimination process. While liver function is generally found to be normal, there is evidence that some individuals with anorexia develop changes in liver enzyme levels and overall damage to the liver. The hormonal (endocrine) system in the body is profoundly affected by anorexia. The complex physical and chemical processes involved in the maintenance of life can be disrupted, with serious consequences. Disturbances in the menstrual cycle are frequent, and secondary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods) affects many adolescent girls with anorexia. Menstrual periods typically return with weight gain and successful treatment. Hormonal imbalances are found in men with anorexia as well. Continual restrictive eating can trick the thyroid into thinking that the body is starving, causing it to slow down in an attempt to preserve calories. When anorexia occurs in a person who also has diabetes mellitus (a tendency toward very high blood sugar levels), the risk of death is higher than in people who have either anorexia or diabetes mellitus alone. Kidney (renal) function may appear normal. However, there are significant changes in kidney function in many people with anorexia, resulting in increased or decreased urination or potentially fatal potassium deficiency. Other long-term effects may include diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive urination and extreme thirst. Bone density loss (osteopenia or thinning of the bones) is a significant complication of anorexia, since women acquire 40%-60% of their bone mass during adolescence. Studies have shown that bone loss can occur fairly rapidly in girls with anorexia. While some studies have shown that bone density may be restored if overall health improves and anorexia is successfully treated, other studies suggest that an increased risk for fracture may persist later in life. Anorexics who abuse a large quantity of laxatives or who frequently vomit are in danger of electrolyte imbalance, which can have life-threatening consequences. Anemia is frequently found in anorexic patients. In addition to having fewer red blood cells, people with anorexia tend to have lower numbers of white blood cells, which play a major role in protecting the body from developing infections. Suppressed immunity and a high risk for infection are suspected but not clinically proven dangers of anorexia. Contrary to what might be expected, anorexia nervosa is associated with high total cholesterol levels. Other physical symptoms, other than the obvious loss of weight, can be seen. Anorexia can cause dry, flaky skin that takes on a yellow tinge. Fine, downy hair grows on the face, back, arms, and legs. Despite this new hair growth, loss of hair on the head is not uncommon. Nails can become brittle. Frequent vomiting can erode dental enamel and eventually lead to tooth loss. People with anorexia might also develop trouble maintaining a consistent body temperature."
What is the treatment for anorexia nervosa?,"'Anorexia may be treated in an outpatient setting, or hospitalization may be necessary. For an individual with severe weight loss that has impaired organ function, hospital treatment must initially focus on correction of malnutrition, and intravenous feeding or tube feeding that goes past the mouth may be required. A gain of between 1 to 3 pounds per week is a safe and attainable goal when malnutrition must be corrected. Sometimes weight gain is achieved using schedules for eating, decreased physical activity, and increased social activity, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. For individuals who have suffered from anorexia for several years, the goals of treatment may need to be achieved more slowly in order to prevent the anorexia sufferer from relapsing as a result of being overwhelmed by treatment.''The overall treatment of anorexia, however, must focus on more than weight gain. There are a variety of treatment approaches dependent upon the resources available to the individual. Many patients find that a short hospitalization followed by participation in a day treatment program is an effective alternative to longer inpatient programs. Most individuals, however, initially seek outpatient treatment involving psychological as well as medical intervention. It is common to engage a multidisciplinary treatment team consisting of a medical-care professional, a dietician or nutritionist, and a mental-health-care professional.''Different kinds of psychological therapy are employed to treat people with anorexia. Individual therapy, cognitive ''behavior therapy'', group therapy, and family therapy have all been successful in the treatment of anorexia. In adolescents, research shows that the Maudsley model of family therapy can be particularly effective in treating this disorder in this population. In contrast to many past approaches to treatment, the Maudsley model approaches the family of the individual with anorexia as part of the solution rather than part of the reason their loved one has the disorder. With ongoing specific guidance from the professional mental-health team, this approach has the family actively help their loved one eat in a healthier manner.''Any appropriate treatment approach addresses underlying issues of control, perfectionism, and self-perception. Family dynamics are explored. Nutritional education provides a healthy alternative to ''weight management'' for the patient. Group counseling or support groups may assist the individual in the recovery process. The ultimate goal of treatment should be for the individual to accept herself/himself and lead a physically and emotionally healthy life.''While no medications have been identified that can definitively reduce the compulsion to starve oneself, ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa'', ''Zydis''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), and ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel'') are medications that are also used as mood stabilizers and to treat ''schizophrenia'' that may be useful in treating anorexia. These medications may also help increase weight and to manage some of the emotional symptoms like ''anxiety'' and ''depression'' that can accompany anorexia. Some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) ''antidepressant'' drugs, like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), have been shown to be helpful in weight maintenance after weight has been gained, as well as having beneficial effects on the mood and ''anxiety'' symptoms that may be associated with the condition.'  "
"What is the prognosis (outcome) of anorexia 
nervosa?","'Anorexia is among the psychiatric conditions that have the highest mortality rate, with an estimated mortality (death) rate of up to 6% due to the numerous complications of the disease. The most common ''causes of death'' in people with anorexia are medical complications of the condition, including ''cardiac arrest'' and electrolyte imbalances.  ''Suicide'' is also a cause of death in people with anorexia.  In the absence of any coexisting personality disorder, younger individuals with anorexia tend to do better over time than their older counterparts.''Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the overall prognosis in an individual with anorexia. Despite most psychiatric medications having little effect on the symptoms that are specific to anorexia, the improvement in associated symptoms (for example, ''anxiety'' and ''depression'') can help anorexia sufferers engage more actively in treatment and otherwise have a powerful, positive effect on the improvement that individuals with anorexia show over time. With appropriate treatment, about half of those affected will make a full recovery. Some people experience a fluctuating pattern of periods of weight gain followed by relapses, while others experience a progressively deteriorating course of the illness over many years, and still others never fully recover. It is estimated that about 20% of people with anorexia remain chronically ill from the condition.''  As with many other mental-health illnesses with addictive symptoms, it takes a day-to-day effort to control the urge to relapse. Many individuals will require ongoing treatment for anorexia over several years, and some may require treatment over their entire lifetime. Factors that seem to predict more difficult recovery from anorexia include vomiting and other purging behaviors,  bulimia nervosa, and symptoms of obsessive personality disorder. The longer the disease goes on, the more difficult it is to treat as well.'  "
How can anorexia nervosa be prevented?,"'While educating the public about the important health benefits of appropriate ''nutrition'' is generally beneficial, it has been found to be less specifically helpful in the ''prevention'' of eating disorders and other body image problems.  More effective approaches are thought to be the addition of education about the bias of media images toward excessive thinness as desirable.  Helping people internalize a self-image and health behaviors that are inconsistent with those of eating disordered individuals have also found to be effective prevention methods for anorexia.'  "
The future of anorexia nervosa,"'Given the complexity of anorexia and how many people with this illness continue to suffer from it despite receiving treatment, researchers are seeking to better understand how this illness develops and how it is most effectively treated. For example, as individuals with anorexia tend to have low levels of cortisol in their blood, and behaviors like dieting and ''exercise'' tend to increase cortisol levels, giving anorexia sufferers cortisol ''supplements'' is being explored with some success.  The best approaches for ''psychotherapy'' in adults with anorexia, the possible benefit of 12-step programs in treatment, the role of genetics in the development of this disorder, and the effectiveness of various medications in treating anorexia are other areas of continued need for research.'

For an individual with severe weight loss that has impaired organ function, hospital treatment must initially focus on correction of malnutrition, and intravenous feeding or tube feeding that goes past the mouth may be required. A gain of between 1 to 3 pounds per week is a safe and attainable goal when malnutrition must be corrected. Sometimes weight gain is achieved using schedules for eating, decreased physical activity, and increased social activity, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. For individuals who have suffered from anorexia for several years, the goals of treatment may need to be achieved more slowly in order to prevent the anorexia sufferer from relapsing as a result of being overwhelmed by treatment.''The overall treatment of anorexia, however, must focus on more than weight gain. There are a variety of treatment approaches dependent upon the resources available to the individual. Many patients find that a short hospitalization followed by participation in a day treatment program is an effective alternative to longer inpatient programs. Most individuals, however, initially seek outpatient treatment involving psychological as well as medical intervention. It is common to engage a multidisciplinary treatment team consisting of a medical-care professional, a dietician or nutritionist, and a mental-health-care professional.''Different kinds of psychological therapy are employed to treat people with anorexia. Individual therapy, cognitive ''behavior therapy'', group therapy, and family therapy have all been successful in the treatment of anorexia. In adolescents, research shows that the Maudsley model of family therapy can be particularly effective in treating this disorder in this population. In contrast to many past approaches to treatment, the Maudsley model approaches the family of the individual with anorexia as part of the solution rather than part of the reason their loved one has the disorder. With ongoing specific guidance from the professional mental-health team, this approach has the family actively help their loved one eat in a healthier manner.''Any appropriate treatment approach addresses underlying issues of control, perfectionism, and self-perception. Family dynamics are explored. Nutritional education provides a healthy alternative to ''weight management'' for the patient. Group counseling or support groups may assist the individual in the recovery process. The ultimate goal of treatment should be for the individual to accept herself/himself and lead a physically and emotionally healthy life.''While no medications have been identified that can definitively reduce the compulsion to starve oneself, ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa'', ''Zydis''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), and ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel'') are medications that are also used as mood stabilizers and to treat ''schizophrenia'' that may be useful in treating anorexia. These medications may also help increase weight and to manage some of the emotional symptoms like ''anxiety'' and ''depression'' that can accompany anorexia. Some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) ''antidepressant'' drugs, like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), have been shown to be helpful in weight maintenance after weight has been gained, as well as having beneficial effects on the mood and ''anxiety'' symptoms that may be associated with the condition.'  "
"What is the prognosis (outcome) of anorexia 
nervosa?","'Anorexia is among the psychiatric conditions that have the highest mortality rate, with an estimated mortality (death) rate of up to 6% due to the numerous complications of the disease. The most common ''causes of death'' in people with anorexia are medical complications of the condition, including ''cardiac arrest'' and electrolyte imbalances.  ''Suicide'' is also a cause of death in people with anorexia.  In the absence of any coexisting personality disorder, younger individuals with anorexia tend to do better over time than their older counterparts.''Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the overall prognosis in an individual with anorexia. Despite most psychiatric medications having little effect on the symptoms that are specific to anorexia, the improvement in associated symptoms (for example, ''anxiety'' and ''depression'') can help anorexia sufferers engage more actively in treatment and otherwise have a powerful, positive effect on the improvement that individuals with anorexia show over time. With appropriate treatment, about half of those affected will make a full recovery. Some people experience a fluctuating pattern of periods of weight gain followed by relapses, while others experience a progressively deteriorating course of the illness over many years, and still others never fully recover. It is estimated that about 20% of people with anorexia remain chronically ill from the condition.''  As with many other mental-health illnesses with addictive symptoms, it takes a day-to-day effort to control the urge to relapse. Many individuals will require ongoing treatment for anorexia over several years, and some may require treatment over their entire lifetime. Factors that seem to predict more difficult recovery from anorexia include vomiting and other purging behaviors,  bulimia nervosa, and symptoms of obsessive personality disorder. The longer the disease goes on, the more difficult it is to treat as well.'  "
How can anorexia nervosa be prevented?,"'While educating the public about the important health benefits of appropriate ''nutrition'' is generally beneficial, it has been found to be less specifically helpful in the ''prevention'' of eating disorders and other body image problems.  More effective approaches are thought to be the addition of education about the bias of media images toward excessive thinness as desirable.  Helping people internalize a self-image and health behaviors that are inconsistent with those of eating disordered individuals have also found to be effective prevention methods for anorexia.'  "
The future of anorexia nervosa,"'Given the complexity of anorexia and how many people with this illness continue to suffer from it despite receiving treatment, researchers are seeking to better understand how this illness develops and how it is most effectively treated. For example, as individuals with anorexia tend to have low levels of cortisol in their blood, and behaviors like dieting and ''exercise'' tend to increase cortisol levels, giving anorexia sufferers cortisol ''supplements'' is being explored with some success.  The best approaches for ''psychotherapy'' in adults with anorexia, the possible benefit of 12-step programs in treatment, the role of genetics in the development of this disorder, and the effectiveness of various medications in treating anorexia are other areas of continued need for research.'

What is anorexia nervosa?,"'Anorexia nervosa'', commonly known as ''anorexia'', is a psychological disorder in which an individual considers themselves as being ''overweight'' or controls the shape and size of a specific body part, even when they are extremely thin. In the more severe form of this disease, one may be petrified of gaining weight or may have a tremendous obsession over the shape of the body to the point that people are sick of eating and may take extreme measures to ''lose weight''.'

What causes anorexia nervosa?,"'The exact cause of ''anorexia'' nervosa is unknown; however, some situations make anorexia more common in certain societies or areas. Factors associated with anorexia nervosa include:''Genetic and biological factors:''Psychological factors:''Environmental factors:''Emotional ''stress'':' Hormonal issues Family history of anorexia Feelings of inadequacy Obsessive-compulsive personality traits Trauma, stress, depression, and other psychiatric disorders Peer pressure Cultural beauty ideals Participation in activities such as ballet, gymnastics, modeling, and weight-restricted sports History of being teased about their size or weight Troubled relationships Joining a new school Death of a loved one"
How is anorexia nervosa diagnosed?,"'The physician may diagnose if a person has anorexia nervosa by:' History taking. Conducting a complete physical examination to check for any visible signs of anorexia. These include checking vitals such as heart rate and blood pressure and examining the nails, skin, and abdomen. Conducting lab tests that include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, liver function tests, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, serum glucose, liver function tests, and serum albumin. Conducting imaging studies such as an X-ray or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."
How is anorexia nervosa treated?,"'Treatment of anorexia nervosa is difficult because people deny the fact that they have a problem. The treatment options of anorexia nervosa include:' Psychotherapy: Different therapies work for different people. Reducing eating disorder behaviors is the first goal of treatment. Psychotherapy involves cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Hospitalization: Hospitalization may be required in case of an emergency. Issues such as heart rhythm disturbance, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or a psychiatric emergency require hospitalization. Medication: Certain antidepressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be effective in controlling anxiety and depression. Nutrition counseling: A healthy approach to food and weight is instilled in the patients. It helps to restore normal eating patterns and teaches the importance of nutrition. Family support: Family support is of utmost importance. The family should help their loved ones to overcome their fears."
How does the treatment for anorexia and anorexia nervosa differ?,"'Simple anorexia is easier to manage by treating the underlying cause of the patient’s loss of appetite. For instance, if the person has anorexia due to acidity or ''gastritis'' the appetite will be restored by managing the gastritis. If certain infections such as ''tuberculosis'' are causing anorexia, the treatment of the infection typically restores the appetite.''Sometimes ''chemotherapy'' in ''cancer'' patients compromises their ability or desire to eat, in which case, appetite ''stimulants'' may be prescribed to treat this cause of anorexia.''In contrast to the symptom anorexia, the treatment for anorexia nervosa is more complex and involves three main principles:\xa0''The treatment of anorexia varies depending on the person’s needs. Treatment options include:' Stabilizing the weight loss Starting nutrition rehabilitation to restore healthy weight Treating emotional issues such as low self-esteem, distorted thinking patterns and developing long-term, healthy behavioral changes. PsychotherapyAcceptance and Commitment Therapy: It aims to develop motivation for changing actions rather than thoughts and feelings.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT addresses the distorted views and attitudes about weight, shape and appearance. Cognitive Remediation Therapy: It uses reflection and guided supervision to develop the capability of focusing on more than one thing at a time.Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): It involves teaching patients how to develop skills to regulate their emotions, stress-management, mindfulness and healthy interpersonal relationshipsFamily-based treatment (Maudsley Method): This approach is a type of group therapy that involves the patient's family to help them improve communication and develop better skills for overcoming anxiety.Interpersonal Psychotherapy: It aims to resolve an interpersonal problem area.

Facts you should know about anthrax," Anthrax is an infection by bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, usually transmitted from animals. Anthrax causes skin, lung, and bowel disease and can be deadly. Anthrax is diagnosed using bacterial cultures from infected tissues. There are four types of anthrax: cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal, and injection. Anthrax is treated by antibiotics. Pulmonary anthrax is often lethal. It is possible to prevent anthrax. Sadly, the greatest threat of anthrax today is through a bioterrorist attack. Federal, state, and local agencies are working hard to deal with this bioterrorist threat."
What is anthrax? Is anthrax contagious?,"'Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by ''Bacillus anthracis'' that normally affects animals, especially ruminants (such as goats, cattle, sheep, and horses). Anthrax can be transmitted to humans by contact with infected animals or their products. In recent years, anthrax has received a great deal of attention as it has become clear that the infection can also be spread by a bioterrorist attack or by biological warfare. Anthrax does not spread from person to person and is not considered ''contagious''.''There have been a number of outbreaks over the years that are usually localized. Most recently in 2016, in Siberia, Russia, there was a major outbreak of anthrax that sickened at least 13 Siberian people and killed over 2,000 reindeer. Authorities believe that the melting permafrost unburied a reindeer that died of anthrax 75 years ago, causing the release of anthrax spores.' "
What causes anthrax poisoning?,"'The agent of anthrax is a bacterium called '' Bacillus anthracis''. While other investigators discovered the anthrax bacillus, it was a German physician and scientist, Dr. Robert Koch, who proved that the anthrax bacterium was the cause of a disease that affected farm animals in his community. Under the microscope, the bacteria look like large rods. However, in the soil, where they live, anthrax organisms exist in a dormant form called spores. These spores are very hardy and difficult to destroy. The spores have been known to survive in the soil for as long as 48 years. The bacteria secrete toxins composed of three proteins termed protective antigen, lethal factor, and ''edema'' factor.' "
How do people contract anthrax?,"'Anthrax can infect humans in three ways. The most common is infection through the skin, which causes an ugly, dark sore. Humans and animals can ingest anthrax from carcasses of dead animals that have been contaminated with anthrax. Ingestion of anthrax can cause serious, sometimes fatal disease. The most deadly form is inhalation anthrax. If the spores of anthrax are inhaled, they migrate to lymph glands in the chest where they proliferate, spread, and produce toxins that often cause death.' "
How common is anthrax? What are risk factors for anthrax infection?,"""Anthrax is now rare in humans in the United States and developed countries. It still occurs today, largely in countries lacking public-health regulations that prevent exposure to infected goats, cattle, sheep, and horses and their products. In the last few years, there have been rare cases of anthrax in people exposed to imported animal hides used to make drums. Drum players, drum makers, and their family members have been infected in this way. The major concern for those of us in western countries (who don't play drums) is the use of anthrax as an agent of biological warfare. Individuals who are at higher risk to become infected with anthrax include""  veterinarians, livestock producers and farmers, travelers to areas where anthrax is endemic, handlers of animal products (for example, animal hides), laboratory personnel that study anthrax, and mail handlers, military personnel, and individuals trained to respond to bioterrorists and/or biological warfare."
How long is the incubation period with anthrax?,"'The incubation period (the period between contact with anthrax and the start of symptoms) may be relatively short, from one to five days. Like other infectious diseases, the incubation period for anthrax is quite variable and it may be weeks before an infected individual feels sick.' "
What kinds of diseases does anthrax cause? What are the signs and symptoms of anthrax infections?,"'There are four forms of disease caused by anthrax: cutaneous (skin) anthrax, inhalation anthrax, gastrointestinal (bowel) anthrax, and the newly designated injection anthrax.''The cutaneous (skin) form of anthrax (80% of all anthrax infections) starts as a red-brown raised spot that enlarges with considerable redness around it, ''blistering'', and hardening. The center of the spot then shows an ulcer crater with blood-tinged drainage and the formation of a black crust called an eschar. There are swollen glands (''lymph nodes'') in the area. Symptoms include muscle aches and ''pain'', ''headache'', ''fever'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''. The illness usually resolves in about six weeks, but deaths may occur if patients do not receive appropriate antibiotics.''This new form of anthrax has been identified in ''heroin''-injecting drug users in northern Europe and has not yet been reported in the United States. Symptoms may take days to months before they appear. The signs and symptoms of injection anthrax can include small ''blisters'' or ''bumps'' that may ''itch'' at the injection site, ''fever'' and ''chills'', swelling around the sores, and deep abscesses may develop under the skin or muscle. Painless skin sores with black centers (dark scabs) may appear after the blisters or bumps develop.''The first symptoms are subtle, gradual and ''flu-like'' (''influenza'') with a ''sore throat'' and ''headaches''. In a few days, however, the illness worsens and there may be severe respiratory distress with ''shortness of breath'' and ''pain in the chest'' and/or muscles. Some patients may begin ''coughing up blood''. ''Shock'', ''coma'', and death follow. Inhalation anthrax does not cause a true ''pneumonia''. In fact, the spores get picked in the ''lungs'' up by scavenger cells called macrophages. Most of the spores are killed. Unfortunately, some survive and are transported to glands in the chest called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes may swell. In the lymph nodes, the spores that survive multiply, produce deadly toxins, and spread throughout the body. Severe hemorrhage and tissue death (necrosis) occurs in these lymph nodes in the chest. From there, the disease spreads to the adjacent lungs and the rest of the body. Inhalation anthrax is a very serious disease, and unfortunately, most affected individuals will die even if they get appropriate antibiotics. Why is this so? The antibiotics are effective in killing the bacteria, but they do not destroy the deadly toxins that have already been released by the anthrax bacteria.''Now rare, anthrax of the bowels (gastrointestinal anthrax) is the result of eating undercooked, contaminated meat. The symptoms of this form of anthrax include ''nausea'', ''loss of appetite'', ''bloody diarrhea'' and fever followed by ''abdominal pain''. The bacteria invade through the bowel wall. Then the infection spreads throughout the body through the bloodstream (septicemia) with deadly toxicity.' "
What specialists treat anthrax?,"'Although primary-care doctors and pediatricians can treat anthrax, consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is suggested. Other doctors who may help diagnose and/or treat the various types of anthrax include emergency-medicine specialists, pulmonologists, critical-care specialists, and physicians who are experts in treating biologic agents used in warfare.' "
How is the diagnosis made of anthrax?,"'The history, including the occupation of the person, is important. The bacteria may be found in cultures or smears in cutaneous (skin) anthrax and in throat swabs and sputum in pulmonary anthrax. Chest ''X-rays'' may also show characteristic changes in and between the lungs. Once the anthrax is disseminated, bacteria can be seen in the blood using a microscope. Of course, if anthrax is deliberately spread, the manifestations of the disease may be unusual. Indeed, in the ''bioterrorism'' attack in the U.S. in 2001, anthrax spores were spread through the postal system as a white powder mailed with letters.' "
What is the treatment for anthrax?,"'In most cases, early treatment can cure anthrax. The cutaneous (skin) form of anthrax can be treated with common antibiotics such as ''penicillin'', ''tetracycline'', ''erythromycin'' (Ilotycin, Ery-Ped, ''Ery-Tab''), and ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''). The pulmonary form of anthrax is a medical emergency. Early and continuous intravenous therapy with antibiotics may be lifesaving. In a bioterrorism attack, individuals exposed to anthrax will be given antibiotics before they become sick. A ''vaccine'' exists but is not yet available to the general public. Most experts think that the vaccine will also be given to exposed individuals who are victims of a bioterrorist attack. Of note, anthrax is a reportable disease. That means that local or state health agencies must be notified if a case of anthrax is diagnosed. These agencies can better characterize the anthrax so that the affected individual can receive the most effective treatment for that particular organism.''Individuals exposed to aerosolized spores (bioterrorism scares or attacks, for example) can participate in postexposure ''prevention'' of anthrax. Four antibiotics are recommended by the FDA: ''doxycycline'' (Doryx, ''Oracea'', Monodox), ciprofloxacin, ''levofloxacin'' (''Levaquin'', Quixin, Iquix), and parenteral procaine penicillin G. In addition to these antibiotics, a three-dose series of anthrax vaccine should be started as soon as possible after exposure.' "
Is it possible to prevent anthrax? Is there an anthrax vaccine?,"'Public-health measures to prevent contact with infected animals are invaluable. There is a vaccine available for people at high risk (such as veterinarians, laboratory technicians, employees of textile mills processing imported goat hair, and members of the armed forces). The Department of Defense and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working very hard to prevent a bioterrorist attack and to be prepared to deal with the consequences if one occurs. For anthrax and other infectious diseases, ''vaccines'' with greater efficacy and fewer side effects are under development. Currently, most ''vaccines'' are given by injection into fat or muscle below the skin. Early studies in experimental animals are showing promise for an oral vaccine for anthrax. Obviously, a pill is easier to take than a shot, and ''the pill'' may even be a safer and more effective route of administration.'  "
What is the prognosis for anthrax infections?,"'The prognosis for anthrax infections depends on the type of infection and how rapidly antibiotic treatment is initiated. The worst prognosis is for the pulmonary form of anthrax caused by inhaling spores from the environment or from ""weaponized"" anthrax preparations. The other forms of anthrax have a range of outcomes from good to poor, depending upon how quickly diagnosis and treatment occurs and how severe the infection effects the various organ systems.' "
What is citrulline antibody?,"'Citrulline antibody is an immune protein (antibody) that binds to a nonstandard amino acid (citrulline) that is formed by removing amino groups from the natural amino acid, arginine. A chemical process known as citrullination causes this change to occur. Citrulline antibodies are measured with a blood (serum) test that is analyzed in laboratories. The test is also known as anti-citrulline antibody, cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCPA), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti-CCP.''Research suggests that in the joints of patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis'', proteins may be changed to citrulline as part of the process that leads to inflammation of the rheumatoid joint.'

What is fundoplication?,"   Fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD causes inflammation, pain (heartburn), and other serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. GERD results when acid refluxes (regurgitates, or backwashes) from the stomach back up into the esophagus. Under normal conditions, there is a barrier to the reflux of acid from the stomach. One part of this barrier is the lower-most muscle of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter). Most of the time, this muscle is contracted (constricted, or tight), which closes off the esophagus from the stomach. In patients with GERD, the sphincter does not function normally. The muscle is either weak or relaxes inappropriately. Fundoplication is a surgical technique that strengthens the barrier to acid reflux when the sphincter does not function normally."
What happens during fundoplication?,"'During the fundoplication procedure, the part of the stomach that is closest to the entry of the esophagus (the fundus of the stomach) is gathered, wrapped, and sutured (sewn) around the lower end of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. (The gathering and suturing of one tissue to another is called plication.) This procedure increases the pressure at the lower end of the esophagus and thereby reduces acid reflux.''Also, during fundoplication, other surgical steps frequently are taken that also may reduce acid reflux. For instance, if the patient has a ''hiatal hernia'' (which occurs in 80% of patients with GERD), the contents of the ''hernia'' sac (the stomach) may be pulled down from the chest and the opening the ''diaphragm'' (the hiatus) through which the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen sutured so that stomach remains within the abdomen. Fundoplication may be done using a large incision (laparotomy in the abdomen or thoracotomy in the chest) or a laparoscope, which requires only several small punctures in the abdomen. The advantage of the laparoscopic method is a speedier recovery and less post-operative ''pain''.' "
What are alternatives to fundoplication?,"'Although fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating GERD, endoscopic methods for treating GERD are being developed. ''Endoscopy'' utilizes endoscopes, which are long flexible tubes that are passed by the doctor through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. The inside of the esophagus can be viewed through the endoscope and various instruments can be passed through channels in the endoscope.''In one endoscopic method for treating GERD, an instrument is inserted that delivers an electrical current to the lower esophageal sphincter. This results in scarring which tightens the sphincter. In asecond method, ''sutures'' are placed in the sphincter to tighten the sphincter. Another treatment for GERD invloves placing a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent acid from refluxing into the esophagus. This is called the LINX procedure.''Other methods also have been employed experimentally. Endoscopic methods offer a simpler way of treating GERD than fundoplication. As more data is being accumulated as to how effective, safe, or long-lasting they are, their use is increasing.' "
What is prophylactic use of antibiotics?,"'Prophylactic use of antibiotics is the administration of antibiotics before certain surgical procedures to prevent introduction of a bacterial infection to abnormal tissues in the body. For examples, prophylactic antibiotics are used prior to bowel surgery or even significant dental work when the patient has a prosthetic joint or has a deformed or prosthetic ''heart'' valve. People who are at a high risk for contracting infective ''endocarditis'' because of deformed or prosthetic heart valves take prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the risk of infecting the valve with bacteria introduced into the body during an invasive procedure.\xa0' "
What is infective endocarditis?,'Infective endocarditis is infection of the inner heart tissue (''endocardium'') and heart valves. Infective endocarditis is caused by bacteria infecting these tissues after entering the bloodstream.' 
Why are prophylactic antibiotics administered?,"'Infective endocarditis is a serious condition that can destroy the function of the heart and its valves. The condition can cause abscesses in the heart, ''congestive heart failure'' and malfunction of the valves.''Infective endocarditis is difficult to treat and potentially fatal, so it is important to prevent its occurrence when possible.\xa0''The link between certain invasive surgical procedures and infective endocarditis was first identified in the 1920s.\xa0 In 1955 the American Heart Association (AHA) first recommended the use of prophylactic antibiotics when performing certain invasive surgical procedures to prevent infective endocarditis.' "
Who gets antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis?,"'Antibiotic prophylaxis was given for a wide range of invasive procedures, particularly dental procedures, performed on cardiac patients who were considered at risk for infective endocarditis.''Growing bacterial resistance to antibiotics and other factors have prompted changes to the guidelines, however, the drawbacks of widespread prophylactic use include:''In 2007, the AHA updated its guidelines to reduce the use of prophylactic antibiotics to only those patients with ''heart disease'' who had a particularly high risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. Studies conducted since the guideline revisions have shown no appreciable increase in the incidence of infective endocarditis.''Currently, prophylactic antibiotic regimen for endocarditis is only for patients with high-risk cardiac conditions such as:' Rising bacterial resistance to antibiotics Adverse reactions to antibiotics Benefit to extremely few patients Implanted prosthetic cardiac valve History of infective endocarditis Cardiac valvular disease developed after cardiac transplant   Certain kinds of congenital heart disease (CHD) as follows:Unrepaired cyanotic CHD, in which deoxygenated blood bypasses the lungs and enters the systemRepaired CHD with prosthetic device implantRepaired CHD with residual defects Unrepaired cyanotic CHD, in which deoxygenated blood bypasses the lungs and enters the system Repaired CHD with prosthetic device implant Repaired CHD with residual defects"
When should prophylactic antibiotics be given?,'Patients with high-risk heart conditions should receive prophylactic antibiotics one hour prior to the following procedures:''AHA guidelines dropped the requirement for antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis in the following procedures:' All invasive dental procedures such asTooth extractionPeriodontal surgeryReplacement of tooth displaced by traumaTooth implant placement Tooth extraction Periodontal surgery Replacement of tooth displaced by trauma Tooth implant placement Invasive respiratory tract procedures such asTonsillectomyAdenoidectomy Tonsillectomy Adenoidectomy Procedures for treatment of infected skin or musculoskeletal tissue Delivery of pregnant women Urogenital and gastrointestinal procedures Noninvasive respiratory tract procedures such as bronchoscopy Noninvasive dental procedures such asDental X-raysPlacement and adjustment of braces and other orthodontic appliancesTreatment of superficial cariesAdministration of anesthetic injections through noninfected tissueFollowing shedding of milk teethAfter trauma to the lip or mouth Dental X-rays Placement and adjustment of braces and other orthodontic appliances Treatment of superficial caries Administration of anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue Following shedding of milk teeth After trauma to the lip or mouth
What are the antibiotic prophylactic regimens for endocarditis?,"'The most common cause for infective endocarditis after invasive dental, oral, respiratory or esophageal procedures is ''Streptococcus'' viridans group of bacteria. Other bacteria that can lead to endocarditis are ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and Enterococcus group of bacteria. The antibiotics used in prophylaxis specifically target these bacteria.''Following are the antibiotic prophylactic regimens for endocarditis, administered as a single dose 30-60 minutes before the procedure:''Oral ''amoxicillin''Intravenous/intramuscular (IV/IM) ''ampicillin''Oral ''clindamycin''Oral cephalosporin ''drugs'' such as ''cephalexin''Oral ''azithromycin'' or ''clarithromycin''IV clindamycin''IV/IM cephalosporin drugs such as cefazolin or ceftriaxone' Adults: 2 g Children: 50 mg/kg not exceeding 2 g Adults: 2 g Children: 50 mg/kg not exceeding 2 g Adults: 600 mg Children: 20 mg/kg not exceeding 600 mg Adults: 2 g Children: 50 mg/kg not exceeding 2 g Adults: 500 mg Children: 15 mg/kg not exceeding 500 mg Adults: 600 mg Children: 20 mg/kg not exceeding 600 mg Adults: 1 g Children: 50 mg/kg not exceeding 1 g"
What is antibiotic resistance?,"'Antibiotics are medications used to kill or slow the growth of bacteria and some fungi. Antibiotics are not effective in treating infections caused by ''viruses''.''The definition of antibiotic resistance is the adaptive change in bacteria (mutation) that allows them to grow in the presence of a drug (an antibiotic) that would normally slow their growth or kill them. These antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi become harder to treat, causing increased morbidity.''CDC (Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'') statistics show there are approximately 2 million antibiotic resistant infections each year in the United States. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), antibiotic resistant infections can lead to longer hospital stays, higher treatment costs, and more deaths.' "
What are some types of antibiotic resistance?," Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria: commonly seen in hospitals and healthcare settings (hospital acquired or HA-MRSA), but also in among people in close contact such as athletes (community associated or CA-MRSA). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) bacteria are resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic often used as a last resort Certain microbes are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics:Food-borne bacteria responsible for food poisoning such as E. coli, Salmonella, and CampylobacterSexually transmitted bacteria that cause gonorrheaPenicillin-resistant Streptococci that cause pneumoniaTuberculosisInfluenzaHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)Malaria Food-borne bacteria responsible for food poisoning such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter Sexually transmitted bacteria that cause gonorrhea Penicillin-resistant Streptococci that cause pneumonia Tuberculosis Influenza Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Malaria"
What causes antibiotic resistance?,"'Bacteria, viruses are living organisms that can change over time. They reproduce and spread quickly and efficiently, and can adapt to their environments and change in ways to ensure their survival. When confronted with an antibiotic that may hinder their ability to reproduce, genetic changes (mutations) can occur that enable the microbe to survive. This evolution can happen in a number of ways:' Selective Pressure: In the presence of an antibiotic, microbes that carry resistance genes can survive and replicate. Mutation: Most microbes reproduce by dividing every few hours and mutations may occur that can help microbes survive exposure to antibiotics. Gene Transfer: Microbes can get genes from each other that make the microbe drug resistant. Societal Pressures: The widespread use of antibiotics in different spheres of society, sometimes when they're unnecessary, creates selective pressure that allows resistant organisms to be produced.Inappropriate Use: Inappropriate use of antibiotics can occur, such as when a healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic because an insistent patient has demanded it, even without a diagnosis.Inadequate Diagnostics: Sometimes broad-spectrum antibiotics are used even when a specific antibiotic might be better because there is incomplete or imperfect information to diagnose an infection. This contributes to selective pressure.Hospital Use: Critically ill patients are more susceptible to infections and they frequently need antibiotics, but this increased use along with close contact among sick patients creates an environment where antimicrobial-resistant germs can spread easily.Agricultural Use: Adding antibiotics to agricultural feed can promote drug resistance. Inappropriate Use: Inappropriate use of antibiotics can occur, such as when a healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic because an insistent patient has demanded it, even without a diagnosis. Inadequate Diagnostics: Sometimes broad-spectrum antibiotics are used even when a specific antibiotic might be better because there is incomplete or imperfect information to diagnose an infection.

Agricultural Use: Adding antibiotics to agricultural feed can promote drug resistance."
How are antibiotic-resistant infections diagnosed?,"'Tests may be used to determine which microbe is causing an infection and to which antibiotics the microbe might be resistant (called a “culture and sensitivity”). But often, diagnostic tests can take days to weeks to get results because many of tests require the microbe to grow over a period of time before it can be identified.''Samples may be taken of blood, urine, ''stool'', sputum, tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or ''mucus'' from the nose, throat, or genitals. Samples may then be stained and examined under a microscope, cultured (allowed to grow), or tested for antibodies, antigens, or genetic material (such as DNA or RNA) from the microorganism to determine the organism responsible for the infection.''In many cases treatment decisions are needed before test results are known and healthcare providers may prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics when a more specific treatment might be better.' "
What is the treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections?,"'A doctor will decide when to use antibiotics, and what ''drugs'' should be used. Antibiotics are used to fight ''bacterial infections'' and sometimes, ''fungal infections''. Antibiotics are not intended for use against viral infections. They are ineffective and may contribute to the development antibiotic-resistant bacteria.''If you have a bacterial infection that is resistant to a particular antibiotic, a doctor can prescribe a different, more appropriate, antibiotic that is more effective against that organism.' "
Can antibiotic resistance be prevented?,"'To prevent antibiotic resistance, follow all instructions from your doctor on taking prescription medications. Complete the entire course of the antibiotics as directed, even if you feel better before you finish them. Never share your medications with others or take medicine prescribed for another person.''The less often you get sick, the less often you might need to take antibiotics. The less often you take antibiotics, the less likely your infections are to develop antibiotic resistance. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle including proper ''nutrition'', regular ''exercise'', and getting adequate ''sleep'' can help your immune system stay healthy.''In addition, practice good hygiene such as washing hands frequently to prevent the spread of illness.' "
What are the types of oral diabetes medications?,"'Oral ''diabetes medications'' are used to improve blood ''sugar'' (glucose) control in patients with ''type 2 diabetes''.''Currently, there are nine drug classes of oral ''diabetes'' medications approved for the treatment of ''type 2 diabetes''.''These medications differ in the way they function in the body to reduce blood glucose.''Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is the only biguanide available in the United States and is generally the first choice for oral treatment of type 2 ''diabetes mellitus''. Metformin improves''Sulfonylureas are the oldest classes of oral ''diabetes'' medications. Sulfonylureas work primarily by stimulating the release of insulin. Insulin is the hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose by increasing the uptake of blood glucose by tissues and increasing the storage of glucose in the liver.''Meglitinides and sulfonylureas have a similar mechanism of action. Meglitinides are short-acting glucose-lowering medications. They stimulate the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.''Thiazolidinediones enhance insulin sensitivity meaning that the effect of a given amount of insulin is greater. Thiazolidinediones also are referred to as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? or PPAR-? agonists.''α-glucosidase inhibitors delay the ''digestion'' and absorption of starch or carbohydrates by inhibiting enzymes in the small intestine which help breakdown these molecules. The starches and carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which then is absorbed from the intestine and increases the level in the blood.''DPP-4 inhibitors help lower blood glucose by increasing the production of insulin from the pancreas and reducing the release of glucose from the liver.''SGLT2 inhibitors'' or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are the newest class of oral ''diabetes'' medications. They work by reducing the absorption of glucose from the fluid that is filtered from the blood by the kidney, causing more glucose to be eliminated in the urine. These medications increase urinary glucose excretion and consequently lower blood ''sugar'' levels.''Currently, the only bile acid sequestrant approved for the oral treatment of ''type 2 diabetes'' is ''colesevelam'' (''Welchol''). Bile acid sequestrants function primarily in the intestines where they bind to and decrease the reabsorption of bile acid. The exact mechanism by which these agents lower blood glucose is not known.''Bromocriptine'' (Cycloset) is a dopamine agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanism whereby bromocriptine lowers blood glucose is not known.'   α-glucosidase inhibitors Biguanides Sulfonylureas Meglitinides Thiazolidinediones DPP-4 inhibitors Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors Dopamine agonists Bile acid sequestrants the body's response to natural insulin, decreases the absorption of glucose from the intestines, and reduces the production of glucose by the liver."

What are the side effects of oral diabetes medications?,'The nine classes of oral diabetes ''drugs'' differ in their side effect profile. The main side effects of each class are as listed.' 
Side effects of thiazolidinediones,"'Thiazolidinediones may cause' liver disease, fluid retention, weight gain, increased risk for fractures, increased risk for bladder cancer, and increased risk for ovulation which may result in pregnancies."
Side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors,"'Although DPP-4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, they may cause' hypoglycemia, headache, nasopharyngitis, fluid retention, hives, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and facial swelling."
Side effects of biguanides (metformin [Glucophage]),"'The most common side effects of metformin include''These side effects usually are mild and tend to decrease in severity over time despite continuation of treatment.''Other reported side effects of metformin include''Although rare, metformin may cause lactic acidosis, a serious condition that occurs due to the accumulation of acid in the body.' stomach discomfort, upset stomach, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. metallic taste, interference with vitamin B12 absorption, and exercise induced hypoglycemia."
Side effects of sulfonylureas,"'Sulfonylureas most commonly cause hypoglycemia (''low blood glucose'') and weight gain. Less common side effects are' skin rash, drop in red blood cell count, liver disease, and upset stomach."
Side effects of meglitinides,'The most common side effects of meglitinides are hypoglycemia and weight gain. The risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain appears to be low in comparison to sulfonylureas.'

Side effects of bromocriptine mesylate (Cycloset),"'Side effects associated with bromocriptine therapy include:\\' nausea, runny nose, headache, weakness, dizziness, constipation, and sinusitis."
What drugs interact with oral diabetes medications?,"'Drug interactions'' with oral diabetes drugs vary based on individual diabetes drug classes. However, drugs which cause blood glucose levels to increase may diminish the effectiveness of any oral diabetes drug therapy. Examples of drugs which increase blood glucose include''Metformin is eliminated from the body via the kidneys in a process known as renal tubular secretion. Drugs which are also eliminated via this same pathway may compete with metformin for elimination when administered concomitantly and increase the risk of metformin associated side effects due to an increase in blood levels of metformin. Examples of such drugs include'""Due to the risk of lactic acidosis metformin containing products must be temporarily discontinued prior to the administration of radiopaque contrast dyes. Metformin should be held for at least 48 hours after contrast dye administration and should not be restarted until the patient's kidney function returns back to normal."" thiazide diuretics, other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid medications, estrogens, birth control pills, phenytoin (Dilantin), nicotinic acid, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and isoniazid (Nydrazid). amiloride (Midamor), digoxin (Lanoxin), morphine, procainamide (Procanbid), quinidine (Quin-Tab), quinine (Qualaquin), ranitidine (Zantac), triamterene (Dyrenium), trimethoprim (Primsol), dofetilide (Tikosyn), and vancomycin (Vancocin). Sulfonylureas are broken down (metabolized) by a set of liver enzymes. Medications which inhibit or induce the activity of these enzymes may impact their blood levels. Gemfibrozil (Lopid) strongly inhibits the breakdown of repaglinide and consequently may cause prolonged hypoglycemia. Thiazolidinediones may interact with drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of liver certain enzymes known as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C9. The dose of pioglitazone must be limited to 15 mg when administered in combination with gemfibrozil (Lopid), a strong inhibitor of these pathways. DPP-4 inhibitors are metabolized extensively by liver enzymes. Therefore, drug-drug interactions are possible with agents that alter the function of these enzymes. The effectiveness of meglitinides may be reduced when administered with carbohydrate digesting enzymes such as amylase, pancreatin, or pancrelipase. Bile acid sequestrants have many drug interactions. Bile acid sequestrants decrease the absorption of levothyroxine (Synthroid), glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase), and birth control pills when administered together. Additionally, they may also decrease the absorption of other drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin), digoxin (Lanoxin), and fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E, and K). Therefore, these agents should be administered at least 4 hours before the dose of colesevelam. Bromocriptine is metabolized by CYP3A4 liver enzymes. Drugs which alter the activity of these enzymes may change bromocriptine levels in the blood and consequently cause adverse effects. Bromocriptine may also interact with some antipsychotics and ergot based migraine medications."
What formulations of oral diabetes medications are available?, All oral diabetes drugs are available in tablet forms. Glipizide and metformin are available as extended-release tablets. Metformin also is available in an oral liquid form. Colesevelam is available as an oral powder for suspension.
"What about taking oral diabetes medications during pregnancy or while 
breastfeeding?","'Use of oral diabetes drugs during ''pregnancy'' is controversial. For most women, the first step to maintaining optimal blood glucose control during pregnancy is to make appropriate lifestyle and dietary changes. Insulin therapy is the preferred treatment of ''pregnant'' women with ''gestational diabetes'' or type 2 diabetes who fail to achieve adequate blood glucose control with dietary or lifestyle (for example, ''exercise'', weight reduction) changes alone.''With the exception of glyburide, all sulfonylureas are classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C (risk not ruled out).''Oral diabetes drugs can enter the ''breast milk'' and can cause hypoglycemia in the ''newborn''. Therefore, careful risk and benefit analysis should be made for each mother and her infant before a decision is made. Use of oral diabetes medications in ''nursing'' mothers should be avoided if possible.' Meglitinides, TZDs also are classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C. Glyburide, metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, and bromocriptine are categorized as pregnancy risk category B (no risk in animal studies). To prevent fetal harm, use of oral diabetes medications should be avoided during pregnancy if possible."
What can cause nausea and vomiting?,"'Nausea'' and ''vomiting'' occur for many reasons. Common causes include ''motion sickness'', self-limited illnesses (''viruses'' or ''food poisoning'') that last a few hours to a few days, and toxins (such as certain medications).''People should consult a doctor if ''nausea'' and/or ''vomiting'' are persistent or are accompanied by other severe symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', ''fever'', yellow discoloration of the skin (''jaundice''), or bleeding. Individuals with severe or ongoing vomiting who have other serious medical problems, are elderly, are very young, or are ''pregnant'' or ''nursing'' infants should also seek medical attention.''Motion sickness'' may occur in many settings including travel by car, air, or boat. This may be the best indication for the use of ''over-the-counter'' medications for nausea and vomiting associated with riding in a vehicle. Other inner-ear problems that are related to motion sickness can create a feeling of nausea as well.''Viral infections can cause nausea and vomiting, which is often associated with ''diarrhea''. Often, an ""outbreak"" can be identified with several cases occurring in the same household or community. ''Food poisoning'' from either bacteria or viruses can cause similar symptoms. In both situations, the illnesses generally run their course over a period of one to two days and resolve without treatment. The very young and very old are at risk for ''dehydration'' from these usually minor illnesses.''Medications can cause nausea or vomiting and should be suspected when the symptoms appear within a short time after starting a new medication. Notify your prescribing physician if this happens.''Nausea and vomiting are not diseases but symptoms that can be caused by many conditions. Several other less common reasons for nausea and vomiting are'   early stages of pregnancy (nausea occurs in approximately 50%-90% of all pregnancies, vomiting in 25%-55%), painful injury, postoperative (the period following surgery), an emotional or fearful situation, gallbladder disease, gallstones or infection (cholecystitis), overeating (especially after gastric bypass surgery), a reaction to certain smells or odors, heart attack (may be the only symptom in some people), concussion or head injury, brain tumor, ulcers or gastritis, bulimia or other psychological illnesses, and gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying often seen in people with diabetes)."
What types of medications are available to treat nausea and vomiting?,"'Drugs'' used to treat nausea and vomiting are called antiemetics. Many types of antiemetics can decrease the severity of nausea, although most require a medical evaluation and prescription. Medicines available over-the-counter are mainly recommended for use in motion sickness and for cases of mild nausea.'   Meclizine hydrochloride (Bonine) is an antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Unless recommended by a physician, it should not be taken by people with lung diseases, glaucoma, or those who have difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate. Meclizine may cause drowsiness and should not be taken with other sedatives such as alcohol, tranquilizers, or sleeping pills. Due to drowsiness, people using meclizine should not drive or operate dangerous machinery. Meclizine is not recommended in children under 12 or in pregnant or nursing women unless recommended by a doctor. Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) also is an antihistamine. Its use should be limited to motion sickness. It can cause drowsiness and should be avoided in the same situations as Meclizine. Several different formulations of dimenhydrinate are available, including a children's liquid, which should be used according to the directions under the direction of a physician. Dramamine Less Drowsy Formula contains meclizine, like Bonine, and may have fewer sedative side effects. Both meclizine and dimenhydrinate are recommended to be taken about an hour before travel to prevent motion sickness. Emetrol is an oral solution designed to soothe the stomach when nausea and vomiting are caused by viral or bacterial infection or overeating. Emetrol contains sugar and phosphoric acid. Diabetics should not use Emetrol without medical supervision because of the concentrated sugar. According to its manufacturer, Emetrol should not be taken for more than five doses in one hour without consulting a physician. Consult a doctor before using this medicine for pregnant or nursing women and young children. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) is a product containing bismuth subsalicylate, a chemical shown to be effective in relieving nausea and upset stomach. This remedy has a direct effect on the stomach lining and has no known serious side effects. It may cause the darkening of the stool color and of the tongue. Pregnant or nursing women should consult their doctors before using bismuth subsalicylate since part of the active ingredient (salicylate) is chemically similar to aspirin, which may harm infants and the fetus. Patients allergic to aspirin or related drugs also should not use bismuth subsalicylate. Use under the direction of a physician if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or have diabetes or gout because the salicylate may further promote the anticoagulant effect."
What is thyroid peroxidase?,"'Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme made in the thyroid gland that is important in the production of ''thyroid hormone''. TPO is found in thyroid follicle cells where it converts the thyroid hormone T4 to T3.'""The thyroid gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below the Adam's apple, wrapped around the trachea (windpipe). "" "
What is the thyroid peroxidase test?,"'Thyroid peroxidase test is a test that measures the level of an antibody that is directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO). '""Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are produced within the body. The presence of TPOAb in the blood reflects a prior attack on the thyroid tissue by the body's immune system. ""  "
What does a positive thyroid peroxidase test mean?," Most people with chronic thyroiditis display a positive TPO test. The test is also positive in lesser numbers of people with other thyroid diseases. Other autoimmune disorders that may cause a positive TPOAb test include:Sjogren's syndrome,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andpernicious anemia. Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia. About 3% of people with a positive TPOAb test show no evidence of disease. The chance of having a positive TPOAb test is greater in females and increases with age."
What are other names for thyroid peroxidase test?,"'This test goes by a confusing number of names, including:''Previous contributing author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP' thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody (TPOAb) test,  thyroid peroxidase autoantibody test,  antimicrosomal antibody test, and  antithyroid microsomal antibody test."
What are antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)?,"'Between 95 and 98% of patients with ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' (''PBC'') have autoantibodies (antibodies to self) in their blood that react with the inner lining of mitochondria. These autoantibodies are called antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Mitochondria are the energy factories present inside all of our cells, not just the cells of the ''liver'' or bile ducts. (The mitochondria use the oxygen carried in the blood from the ''lungs'' as a fuel to generate energy.) AMA actually bind to protein antigens that are contained in multienzyme complexes (packages of enzymes) within the inner lining of the mitochondria. These multienzyme complexes produce key chemical reactions necessary for life. The complexes are referred to as multienzyme because they are made up of multiple enzyme units.''AMA specifically react against a component of this multienzyme complex called E2. In PBC, AMA preferentially react with the E2 component of one of the multienzymes that is called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Accordingly, the antigen is designated as PDC-E2. The practical importance of all of this is that the PDC-E2 antigen is now used, as discussed below, in a diagnostic test for PBC. The PDC-E2 antigen is also referred to as M2, a term introduced to designate it as the second mitochondrial antigen discovered by researchers interested in PBC.'  "
Do AMA cause the destruction of the bile ducts in PBC?,"'In as much as the bile ducts are the main targets of destruction in PBC, the question was asked whether the AMA reacts with the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts. So, investigators prepared antibodies to PDC-E2. As expected, they found that these antibodies bound to the mitochondria within the cells. But, sure enough, recent information suggests that these AMA autoantibodies also bind to PDC-E2 that lies outside the mitochondria, yet within the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts.''This accumulation of PDC-E2 within the biliary epithelial cells is observed exclusively in the livers of patients with PBC, and not in normal livers or in livers from patients with any other types of ''liver disease''. Interestingly, it was also observed in the livers of those two to five percent of PBC patients who do not have AMA in their blood (AMA-negative PBC). Furthermore, intense binding of these antibodies to biliary epithelial cells was also found to be the earliest indication of recurrence of PBC in a transplanted liver. (PBC is sometimes treated by liver transplantation.)''Nevertheless, no evidence exists that the AMA itself causes the destruction of the biliary epithelial cells lining the small bile ducts. Neither the presence nor the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood appears to be related to the inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts. Indeed, immunization of animals with PDC-E2 antigen results in production of AMA without any liver or bile duct damage (pathology).' "
How is the blood test for AMA done?,"""The most economical test for AMA applies diluted samples of a patient's serum onto tissue sections from rat stomach or kidney in the laboratory. (Remember that mitochondria are present in virtually all cells, not just the cells of the liver and bile ducts.) Serum antibodies that attach (bind) to mitochondrial membranes within the tissue cells can then be observed with a microscope. The most dilute sample of serum showing this binding reaction is reported, using the term titer. The titer indicates the most dilute serum sample that reacts with the tissue mitochondria. A higher titer means there is a greater amount of AMA in the serum.""'The antigen recognized by AMA in patients with PBC is now known to be PDC-E2 and is also often referred to as the M2 antigen. So, newly developed tests for antibodies that bind to PDC-E2 are more specific and are now available to confirm the diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is the value of the AMA blood test?,"'AMA are detectable in the serum in 95 to 98% of patients with PBC. So, AMA are tremendously important as a diagnostic marker in patients with PBC. The AMA titers in PBC are almost universally greater than or equal to 1 to 40. This means that a serum sample diluted with 40 times its original volume still contains enough antimitochondrial antibodies to be detected in the binding reaction. A positive AMA with a titer of at least 1:40 in an adult with an elevated ''alkaline phosphatase'' in the blood is highly specific for a diagnosis of PBC.' "
What are antinuclear antibodies?,"'We normally have antibodies in our blood that repel invaders in our bodies, such as virus and bacteria microbes. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are unusual antibodies, detectable in the blood, that have the capability of binding to certain structures within the nucleus of the cells. The nucleus is the innermost core within the body\'s cells and contains the DNA, the primary genetic material. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system may be predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one\'s own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs suggest the possible presence of autoimmunity. Therefore, when they are detected in a patient\'s blood (referred to as a ""positive"" result), doctors will consider the possibility that an autoimmune illness exists in that patient.''Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which there is a disorder of the immune system characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases typically feature inflammation of various tissues of the body. Frequently, ANAs are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''polymyositis'', ''scleroderma'"", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'', juvenile ''diabetes mellitus'', Addison disease, ''vitiligo'', ''pernicious anemia'', glomerulonephritis, and ''pulmonary fibrosis''. ANAs can also be found in patients with conditions that are not considered classic autoimmune diseases, such as chronic infections and ''cancer''.' "
Who created the ANA test? How do health care professionals perform the procedure?,"'The ANA test was designed by Dr. George Friou in 1957. The ANA test is performed using a blood sample. An ANA test is performed by testing the blood in the laboratory. The antibodies in the serum of the blood are exposed in the laboratory to cells. It is then determined whether or not antibodies are present that react to various parts of the nucleus of cells. Thus, the term anti-""nuclear"" antibody. Fluorescence techniques are frequently used to actually detect the antibodies in the cells, thus ANA testing is sometimes referred to as fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).' "
What is the interpretation of the ANA screen result?,"'The ANA test is a sensitive screening test used to detect autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases feature a misdirected immune system, and each of them has characteristic clinical manifestations that are used to make the precise diagnosis. The interpretation or identification of a positive ANA test does not make a diagnosis. It simply suggests to the doctor to consider the possibility that an autoimmune disease is present.'  "
What non-autoimmune conditions produce ANAs?,"'ANAs can be produced in patients with infections (virus or bacteria), lung diseases (primary ''pulmonary fibrosis'', ''pulmonary hypertension''), gastrointestinal diseases (''ulcerative colitis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'primary biliary cirrhosis'', alcoholic ''liver disease'""), hormonal diseases (Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis, """"Grave's disease""'), blood diseases (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'', hemolytic ''anemia''), ''cancers'' (''melanoma'', breast, lung, kidney, ovarian and others), skin diseases (''psoriasis'', pemphigus), as well as in the elderly and those people with a family history of rheumatic diseases.'  "
Can medications cause elevated ANAs?,"'Many medications can sometimes stimulate the production of ANAs, including ''procainamide'' (Procan SR), ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline''), and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''). ANAs that are stimulated by medication are referred to as drug-induced ANAs. This does not necessarily mean that any disease is present when these ANAs are ""induced."" Sometimes diseases are associated with these ANAs, and they are referred to as drug-induced diseases.' "
ANAs are defined as having patterns. What does this mean?,"'ANAs present different ""patterns"" depending on the staining of the cell nucleus in the laboratory: homogeneous or diffuse pattern; speckled pattern; nucleolar pattern; and peripheral or rim pattern. While these patterns are not specific for any one illness, certain illnesses can more frequently be associated with one pattern or another. The patterns then can sometimes give the doctor further clues as to types of illnesses to look for in evaluating a patient. For example, the nucleolar pattern is more commonly seen in the disease ''scleroderma''. The speckled pattern is seen in many conditions and in people who do not have any autoimmune disease. These patterns are determined by technical experts who routinely interpret the tests.' "
Are ANAs always associated with illness? What is the normal range?,"""No. ANAs can be found in approximately 5% of the normal population, usually in low titers (low levels). These people usually have no disease. Titers of 1:80 or lower are less likely to be significant. (ANA titers of less than or equal to 1:40 are considered negative.) Even higher titers are often insignificant in patients over 60 years of age. Ultimately, the ANA result must be interpreted in the specific context of an individual patient's symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and other test results. It may or may not be significant, even if positive, in a given individual."" "
What is antiphospholipid syndrome? What are antiphospholipid syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder of the immune system that is characterized by excessive clotting of blood and/or certain complications of ''pregnancy'' (premature miscarriages, unexplained fetal death, or premature birth) and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (such as anti-cardiolipin or ''lupus'' ''anticoagulant'' antibodies) in the blood. Clotting disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome include ''stroke'',\xa0''blood clots'' deep within the legs (deep venous thrombosis, or ''DVT'') and clots in the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism'', or PE). Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have both blood clots and antiphospholipid antibodies that are detectable with blood testing.''Antiphospholipid syndrome is also called phospholipid antibody syndrome, cardiolipin antibody syndrome, and Hughes syndrome in honor of the doctor who first described it.''It is important to note that antiphospholipid antibodies can also be found in the blood of individuals without any disease process. In fact, antiphospholipid antibodies have been reported in a small percentage of the normal population. Harmless antiphospholipid antibodies can be detected in the blood for a brief period occasionally in association with a wide variety of conditions, including bacterial, viral (''hepatitis'' and ''HIV''), and parasitic (''malaria'') infections. Certain ''drugs'' can cause antiphospholipid antibodies to be produced in the blood, including antibiotics, ''cocaine'', ''hydralazine'', ''procainamide'', and quinine.''Nevertheless, the antiphospholipid antibodies (a protein) are not considered normal blood proteins and have been found to be associated with a number of illnesses. These illnesses include abnormal clotting (thrombosis) of arteries (''stroke'' and infarction) and/or veins, premature miscarriages (spontaneous abortions), abnormally low blood platelet counts (''thrombocytopenia''), purplish mottling discoloration of the skin (''livedo reticularis''), ''migraine'' ''headaches'', and a rare form of inflammation of the nervous tissue of the brain or spinal cord called transverse myelitis. Antiphospholipid antibodies have also been detected in over half of patients with the immune disease ''systemic lupus erythematosus''.''Researchers are recently also finding that there are patients with slowly progressive memory problems and patients with a form of ""atypical ''multiple sclerosis''"" who have antiphospholipid antibodies detectable in their blood.'  "
What are the causes and risk factors of antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'The cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is not completely known. Antiphospholipid antibodies reduce the levels of annexin V, a protein that binds phospholipids and has potent clot-blocking (anticoagulant) activity. The reduction of annexin V levels is thought to be a possible mechanism underlying the increased tendency of blood to clot and the propensity to pregnancy loss characteristic of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Certain genes may be risk factors for the development of antiphospholipid syndrome.''Antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anticardiolipin, have also been associated with decreased levels of prostacyclin, a chemical that prevents the clumping together of normal blood clotting elements called platelets.'  "
What laboratory tests can support the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'Patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome can have a variety of antibodies to molecules called phospholipids in their blood. These antibodies include VDRL/RPR (a ''syphilis'' test that can be falsely positive in these patients), ''lupus'' anticoagulant, prolonged PTT, beta 2 glycoprotein I antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibody. As mentioned above, the anticardiolipin antibody has also been found in patients with the immune disease ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', which is characterized by the production of a variety of abnormal antibodies.'  "
How is antiphospholipid syndrome treated?,"'The treatment of patients with anticardiolipin syndrome has substantially evolved since cardiolipin antibodies were noted to be clinically important in the mid-1980s. Each manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome, and each individual patient with the condition, is treated uniquely.''Because many of the features of illness with anticardiolipin syndrome are associated with an abnormal grouping of normal blood clotting elements (platelets), treatment is often directed toward preventing clotting by thinning the blood. Patients with this disorder have a tendency to form blood clots (thrombosis). The unwanted blood clotting can affect the function of virtually any organ. Medications that thin (anticoagulate) the blood, such as ''heparin'' (''Hep-Lock'', Liquaemin, ''Lovenox'') and ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), are powerful blood thinners that are used for treatment. ''Aspirin'' has an effect on platelets that inhibits their grouping (aggregation) and has also been used in low doses to thin the blood of selected patients with less severe disease. Cortisone-related medications, such as ''prednisone'', have been used to suppress the immune activity and inflammation in patients with certain features of the condition. For patients with systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus who also have antiphospholipid syndrome, ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) has been reported to add some protection against blood clotting.''Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected patients with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Recent research studies, however, suggest that intravenous gamma globulin may be no more effective than a combination of aspirin and heparin.'  "
What is the treatment for antiphospholipid syndrome during pregnancy?,"'The treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome during pregnancy typically involves low dose aspirin and low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox).  Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulins have been infused, but their effectiveness is not proven.' "
What is catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a variant of antiphospholipid syndrome that is characterized by blockage of many blood vessels throughout the body. As a result of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, many organs can be affected, including the skin, lungs, brain, ''heart'', kidneys, and bowels. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is treated with anticoagulation, ''corticosteroids'' (cortisone medication), and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).'""Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is rare. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is sometimes referred to as Asherson's syndrome after the researcher who described it in the early 1990s."" "
What is the prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome?,'The prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome depends on the character and the intensity of its manifestations. Earlier treatment will tend to have better outcomes.' 
Is it possible to prevent antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'If a person is already known to have phospholipid antibodies, it is possible to prevent antiphospholipid syndrome with methods that decrease the chances of blood clotting, including aspirin and/or heparin. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may have some preventative benefits for selected patients.' "
"What is the difference between antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy, and psychopathy?","'Psychopathy and sociopathy, although not mental health disorders formally recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, are more severe forms of antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, in order for a medical professional to diagnose someone as a psychopath, a person must have a lack of remorse or guilt about their actions in addition to demonstrating antisocial behaviors. Other core symptoms of this condition include a severe lack of caring for others, a lack of emotion, overconfidence, selfishness, and a higher propensity for planned aggression compared to sociopaths or other people with antisocial personality disorder. They are more likely to be able to maintain steady employment and to seem to have normal relationships compared to sociopaths. Mental health providers believe psychopaths are born lacking the ability to feel guilt rather than being associated with a history of ''trauma'' (like abuse, neglect, or exposure to community violence). While statistics indicate that 50%-80% of incarcerated individuals have antisocial personality disorder, only 15% of those convicted criminals have been shown to have the more severe antisocial personality disorder type of psychopathy.'""Psychopaths tend to be highly suspicious or paranoid, even compared to people with antisocial personality disorder. The implications of this suspicious stance can be dire, in that paranoid thoughts (ideations) tend to lead the psychopathic person to interpret all aggressive behaviors toward them, even those that are justified, as being arbitrary and unfair. A televised case study of a psychopath provided a vivid illustration of the resulting psychopathic anger. Specifically, the criminal featured in the story apparently abducted a girl and sexually abused her over the course of a number of days in an attempt to prove to investigating authorities that his stepdaughter's allegations that he sexually abused her were false.""'Although people often use the terms psychopathy and sociopathy interchangeably, researchers describe sociopaths as having a higher tendency toward impulsive behaviors and angry outbursts and if they form any connection to other people it is usually with other sociopaths. They are also less likely to be able to maintain steady employment or to give the appearance of having normal relationships compared to psychopaths.' "
What are causes and risk factors of antisocial personality disorder?,"'One of the most frequently asked questions about antisocial personality disorder by both professionals and laypeople is whether it is genetic. Many wonder if it is hereditary, just as much as hair, eye, or skin color; if this were the case, children of antisocial people would be highly expected to become antisocial themselves, whether or not they live with the antisocial parent. Fortunately, human beings are just not that simple. Like all personality disorders, and most mental disorders, antisocial personality disorder tends to be the result of a combination of biologic/genetic and environmental factors.'""Although there are no clear biological causes for this disorder, studies on the possible neurodevelopmental risk factors for developing antisocial personality disorder reveal that, in those with the illness, the part of the brain that is primarily responsible for learning from one's mistakes and for responding to sad and fearful facial expressions (the amygdala) tends to be smaller and respond less robustly to the happy, sad, or fearful facial expressions of others. That lack of response may have something to do with the lack of empathy that antisocial individuals tend to have with the feelings, rights, and suffering of others. While some individuals may be more vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder because of their particular genetic background, that is thought to be a factor only when the person is also exposed to life events such as abuse or neglect that tend to put the person at risk for development of the disorder. Similarly, while there are some theories about the role of ""'premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS'') and other hormonal fluctuations in the development of antisocial personality disorder, the disorder cannot be explained as the direct result of such problems.''Other conditions that are risk factors for antisocial personality disorder include ''substance abuse'', attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (''ADHD''), ''reading disorder'', or conduct disorder, which is diagnosed in children. People who experience a temporary or permanent brain dysfunction, often also called organic ''brain damage'', are at risk for developing violent or otherwise criminal behaviors. Theories about the life experiences that increase the risk for developing antisocial symptoms in teenagers and adults provide important clues for its ''prevention''. Examples of such life experiences include a history of ''prenatal'' drug exposure or malnutrition, childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect; deprivation or abandonment; associating with peers who engage in antisocial behavior; or a parent who is either antisocial or alcoholic.'  "
What are antisocial personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'To understand antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD), it is necessary to learn what having any personality disorder involves. As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-V'"", 2013), a personality disorder (PD) is a consistent, enduring pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that is significantly different from what is thought to be consistent with the individual's own social and cultural norms.""'Mental health professionals group personality disorders based on a commonality of symptoms.''Cluster A personality disorders are those that include symptoms of social isolation, and/or strange, eccentric behavior. These disorders include''Cluster B personality disorders are those that involve dramatic or erratic behaviors (counter-social behaviors). These personality disorders include''Cluster C personality disorders have difficulties with ''anxiety'' and inhibited behavior. These disorders include''Antisocial personality disorder is specifically a persistent pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others. Called dissocial personality disorder internationally, the United States-based ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') describes antisocial personality disorder as having diagnostic criteria of a pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that must include at least three of the following specific signs and symptoms:''Other important characteristics of this disorder include that medical professionals do not diagnose this disorder in children (individuals younger than 18 years of age), but the affected person must have shown symptoms of this diagnosis (conduct disorder) at least since 15 years of age. Additionally, a medical professional cannot diagnose antisocial personality disorder if the person only shows symptoms of antisocial personality disorder at the same time they are suffering from ''symptoms of schizophrenia'' or of ''bipolar disorder''. Describing ''bipolar disorder'' as one of the exclusion criteria (diagnoses whose presence means that the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder cannot be assigned) is a change from how this disorder was described in the previous diagnostic manual in the United States, the ''DSM-IV-TR'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision''). The ''DSM-IV'' described having a ''manic'' episode as the exclusion criterion with ''schizophrenia'', not having the depressive aspect of ''bipolar disorder'' as an exclusion criterion.''Intermittent explosive disorder is a recognized diagnosis whose symptoms involve aggression that is excessive in response to its trigger. People may mistake its symptoms for those of antisocial personality disorder. ''Misophonia'', a newly described diagnosis not recognized in the ''DSM-V'', has symptoms that include the sufferer responding to being provoked to anger and impulsive aggression by sights or sounds that are innocuous to most people. The aggression of this disorder may also be mistaken for antisocial personality disorder.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to occur in about 1% of women and 3% of men in the United States. Antisocial personality symptoms in women tend to include self-harm and more of the other ''symptoms of borderline personality disorder'' (''BPD'') than in men.'   paranoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder. antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder. avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCD). Repeatedly breaking laws, as evidenced by repeatedly engaging in behaviors that are grounds for arrest (for example, stealing, fire-setting, other destruction of property, assaults) Repeated deceitfulness in relationships with others, such as telling lies, using false names, or conning others for profit or pleasure Failure to think or plan ahead (impulsivity) Tendency to irritability, hostility, anger, and aggressiveness, as shown by repeatedly assaulting others or getting into frequent physical fights Disregard for their own safety or the safety of others, such that they have a lack of self-control and are prone to repeatedly engaging in risk-taking behaviors Persistent lack of taking responsibility, such as failing to establish a pattern of good work habits or keeping financial obligations A disregard for other people such that there is a lack of feeling guilty about wrongdoing"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose antisocial personality disorder?,"""There is no specific definitive test, such as a blood test, that can accurately assess whether a person has antisocial personality disorder. Mental health practitioners like psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, or clinical psychologists conduct a mental health interview that gathers information to look for the presence of the symptoms previously described. Due to the use of a mental health interview in making the diagnosis and the fact that this disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, it is important that the mental health practitioner know to assess the symptoms in the context of the person's culture so the individual is not assessed as having antisocial personality disorder when he or she does not. Unfortunately, research shows that many practitioners lack the knowledge, experience, and sometimes the willingness to factor cultural context into their assessments."" "
What are the treatments for antisocial personality disorder?,"'Another very common question asked is, can antisocial personality disorder be cured? While it can be quite resistant to change, research shows there are a number of effective treatments for this disorder. For example, teenagers who receive therapy that helps them change the thinking that leads to their maladaptive behavior (cognitive behavioral ''psychotherapy'') experience a significant decrease the incidence of engaging in repeat antisocial behaviors.''On the other hand, attempting to treat antisocial personality disorder like other conditions is not often effective. For example, programs that have tried to use a purely reflective (insight-oriented talk therapy) approach to treating ''depression'' or ''eating disorders'' in people with antisocial personality disorder often worsen rather than improve outcomes in those individuals. In those cases, firm but fair behavior therapy to reward appropriate actions and programming that emphasizes teaching individuals with antisocial personality disorder the skills that one can use to live independently and productively within the rules and limits of society has been the more effective treatment for this condition. Family therapy that helps loved ones of people with antisocial personality disorder appropriately cope with the negative behaviors and promote the positive behaviors of the antisocial personality disorder sufferer can also be an important part of treatment for this condition.''While ''clinical trials'' indicate that medications do not directly treat the behaviors that characterize antisocial personality disorder, they can be useful in addressing conditions that co-occur with this condition. Specifically, ''depressed'' or anxious individuals who also have antisocial personality disorder may benefit from ''antidepressants'' like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), or ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), and those who exhibit impulsive anger may improve when given mood stabilizers like ''lithium'', ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), or ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'').'  "
What are complications if antisocial personality disorder is not treated? What is the prognosis of antisocial personality disorder?,"'Some long-term societal costs of antisocial personality disorder, like the suffering endured by victims of the crimes committed by people with this disorder, are clear. However, when people with ASPD are the charismatic leaders of religious cults, the devastation they can create is often not known unless and until a catastrophe occurs. The multiple murders orchestrated by Charles Manson and the mass ''suicide'' that occurred at the command of the Reverend Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978 are just two such examples.''Individuals who suffer from antisocial personality disorder have a higher risk of abusing ''alcohol'' and other ''drugs'' and repeatedly committing crimes. Imprisonment is a potential consequence. People with antisocial personality disorder are also vulnerable to mood problems, such as ''major depression'', ''anxiety'', and bipolar disorder; having other personality disorders, especially borderline (''BPD'') and narcissistic personality disorders; self-mutilation and other forms of self-harm, as well as dying from homicide, suicide, or accident.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to make the prognosis of virtually any other condition more problematic. Having antisocial personality disorder makes the treatment for problems of substance abuse or emotional or physical substance dependence more difficult. People who have both antisocial personality disorder and ''schizophrenia'' are less likely to comply with treatment programs and are more likely to remain institutionalized in a prison or a hospital. These risks amplify if antisocial personality disorder is not treated. Statistics indicate that many people with antisocial personality disorder experience a remission of symptoms by the time they reach 50 years of age.' "

What is thyroid peroxidase?,"'Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme made in the thyroid gland that is important in the production of ''thyroid hormone''. TPO is found in thyroid follicle cells where it converts the thyroid hormone T4 to T3.'""The thyroid gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below the Adam's apple, wrapped around the trachea (windpipe). "" "
What is the thyroid peroxidase test?,"'Thyroid peroxidase test is a test that measures the level of an antibody that is directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO). '""Autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) are produced within the body. The presence of TPOAb in the blood reflects a prior attack on the thyroid tissue by the body's immune system. ""  "
What does a positive thyroid peroxidase test mean?," Most people with chronic thyroiditis display a positive TPO test. The test is also positive in lesser numbers of people with other thyroid diseases. Other autoimmune disorders that may cause a positive TPOAb test include:Sjogren's syndrome,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andpernicious anemia. Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia. About 3% of people with a positive TPOAb test show no evidence of disease. The chance of having a positive TPOAb test is greater in females and increases with age."
What are other names for thyroid peroxidase test?,"'This test goes by a confusing number of names, including:''Previous contributing author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP' thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody (TPOAb) test,  thyroid peroxidase autoantibody test,  antimicrosomal antibody test, and  antithyroid microsomal antibody test."
What is an antro-duodenal motility study?," An antro-duodenal motility study is used to evaluate the ability of the muscles of the stomach and the first portion of the small intestine (duodenum) to contract. Conditions in which there is abnormal contraction of the muscles of the stomach and the small intestine are referred to as motility disorders. Therefore, an antro-duodenal motility study is used to identify motility disorders."
When is an antro-duodenal motility study used?,"'An antro-duodenal motility study is used to diagnose a motility disorder of the stomach or small intestine, that is, a condition of abnormal function of the muscles of the stomach and/or small intestine. Such abnormal function usually is suspected when there are symptoms and signs of obstruction to or delayed flow of food through the stomach and ''intestines''. These symptoms usually are ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and intestinal distention (enlargement). The obstruction is a direct result of the inability of the abnormally functioning muscles to propel food through the stomach and intestines. One common cause of motility disorders of the stomach and intestines is ''diabetes mellitus''.' "
How is an antro-duodenal motility study done?," For an antro-duodenal motility study, a thin tube (one-eighth inch in diameter) is passed through the nose, down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Sensors in the tube measure the amount of pressure generated when the muscles of the stomach and intestine contract and squeeze tightly around the tube; the greater the contraction of the muscles, the greater the pressure sensed by the tube. All contractions are recorded by a computer for analysis.  Contractions are recorded at rest for up to several hours and for one or two hours after a meal. Thus, a study may take up to six hours."
How are the results of an antro-duodenal motility study evaluated?,"' Normally, there are characteristic patterns of contraction of the stomach and duodenum during fasting periods and after meals. In patients with motility problems of the stomach and/or small intestine, the characteristic patterns are abnormal or completely absent. Such patients may be treated with ''drugs'' to stimulate contraction, such as ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''). ' "
Are there any side effects to an antro-duodenal motility study?,"'There are no important side effects; however, the tube can become quite irritating after several hours, giving the patient a ''sore throat''. Occasionally, the tube also causes nasal irritation.  Within 24 hours after the tube is removed, the irritation disappears.' "
Are there any alternatives to an antro-duodenal motility study?,"'Other tests can help with the evaluation of motility disorders, including upper gastrointestinal ''X-rays'', gastric emptying studies, and electrogastrograms. The most recent device for determining gastrointestinal motility is a radiotelemetry capsule (Smartpill) that senses the pressure generated when the stomach or intestinal muscles contract around it.  The capsule is swallowed, and it then travels through the stomach and intestines.  While it is traveling, it continually senses the pressure around it and transmits this information wirelessly to a receiver worn on the outside of the body.  Later, the data is downloaded from the recorder and analyzed.' "
What is anxiety?,"'Anxiety can be described as the response to a future or possible threat. Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is the response to a real or perceived immediate threat. Fear and anxiety are normal evolved responses in both humans and animals, and physical responses are linked to the ""fight-or-flight"" system. The autonomic nervous system controls the fight-or-flight response in the body, and this response generally includes dilation of the pupils in the eyes, increased heart rate, and increased ''respiration''/''breathing'"". Anxiety responses can include increased vigilance (paying attention to one's surroundings) and muscle tension. Anxiety can be constructive, such as improving performance on a test, sporting event, or public speaking. Although these are normal responses and often helpful responses to danger, anxiety can cause problems when it is turned on too easily, not turned off when danger is absent, or when the response is too strong. Excessive anxiety that causes distress or impairment, that interferes with normal function, or causes avoidance of important activities and people in life, is considered an anxiety disorder."" "
What are the types of anxiety disorders?,"'Anxiety disorders are differentiated based on the type of object or situation that causes fear, anxiety, or avoidance as well as the thought patterns associated with the fear or anxiety. To be considered an anxiety disorder, the fear or anxiety also has to be persistent (lasting usually six months or more), and not a normal developmental phase (for example, a young child being afraid of being away from their parent). Anxiety disorders commonly start in childhood but persist into adulthood.''The most common anxiety disorders are specific ''phobias''. Specific phobias are an excessive fear of a specific object or situation, such as spiders (''arachnophobia''), heights (''acrophobia''), flying, or closed spaces (''claustrophobia''). Most people are aware that their fears (phobias) are excessive, but they often feel powerless to control them. Sometimes a ''phobia'"" may start after a traumatic event (for example, being stuck in a small space; seeing someone injured by an animal), but the symptoms are related to the fear and not related to re-experiencing the trauma (for example, the symptoms don't better fit a ""'post-traumatic stress disorder'' [''PTSD''] diagnosis).''In social anxiety disorder (social phobia or performance anxiety), people are excessively fearful or anxious about social interactions or situations that may involve being observed or scrutinized. Self-consciousness about being observed by others, or performing in front of others, is normal. However, social anxiety is much more extreme and gets in the way of completing normal (and often necessary) activities successfully. Social phobia may be limited to performance situations (such as speaking, singing, acting, etc., in front of others), or it may be more general and related to many (or all) situations around other people.''Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about many different areas that are hard to control. Other anxiety disorders include separation anxiety disorder, selective mutism, ''agoraphobia'' (fear of being outside of the home in various situations), and panic disorder (recurring unexpected ''panic attacks'' and fear of having more panic attacks).''Anxiety disorders may also be caused by ''drugs'', medications, or other substances (including ''stimulants'', ''caffeine'', and ''corticosteroids''). Stimulant medications and herbal preparations include common ''over-the-counter'' drugs such as ''cold'' medicine and decongestants, ephedra- or ''ephedrine''-containing products, ''diet'' pills, or energy ''drinks''. Prescription stimulants are sometimes used to treat ''ADHD''/''ADD'' (''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' or ''attention deficit disorder'') and include ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'', ''Concerta''), amphetamine salts (''Adderall''), ''lisdexamfetamine'' (''Vyvanse''), and others. Withdrawal from ''alcohol'' and certain drugs (including ''benzodiazepines'' [medicines sometimes used to treat acute anxiety, such as ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), or ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''), ''barbiturates'', or newer ''seizure'' medications such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'')]) can also cause anxiety-like symptoms. When a medication or drug is the primary cause of the anxiety, it is diagnosed as a medication or substance-induced anxiety disorder. Medical illnesses or conditions (such as thyroid conditions, breathing problems [such as ''asthma'' or ''COPD'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''), or rare adrenal gland tumors (''pheochromocytoma'')]) can also cause anxiety disorders and/or anxiety-like symptoms.''With the introduction of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), some diagnoses that used to be considered anxiety disorders have been recategorized into new sections. ''Obsessive-compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') is now grouped with other compulsive disorders, like hoarding and ''trichotillomania'' (hair pulling). Similarly, ''post-traumatic stress'' disorder (PTSD) has been reclassified with other trauma-related disorders. OCD and PTSD often have anxiety-related symptoms, and some treatments overlap with those for anxiety disorders.' "
What are anxiety symptoms and signs?,"'Common symptoms and signs of anxiety disorder can include''Anxiety that is associated with specific (specific or simple phobia) or social fears (social phobia) may also result in avoidance of certain situations or an elevation of symptoms to trigger a ''panic attack''.''Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear and/or physical discomfort that reach a peak within minutes. Specific signs and ''symptoms of panic attack'' include both physical and emotional symptoms such as:'""Many anxiety disorders first develop in childhood or adolescence. Although some may resolve, many persist into adulthood. Some anxiety symptoms are related to childhood development. For example, separation anxiety is normal in young children. However, when the fear of being away from their parent persists or interferes with normal development, separation anxiety disorder is diagnosed. Separation anxiety may start after a traumatic event, such as the death of a loved one. However, if the fear is more about the trauma, and not specifically separation from the child's caregivers, an ""'acute stress disorder'' or ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' diagnosis may be more appropriate.''Selective mutism refers to an inability to speak in social situations where there is an expectation to speak (such as school), but they are still able to speak in other settings. When this pattern persists and causes problems with school, work, or other performance, selective mutism is diagnosed.''The similarities and differences in symptoms of anxiety in adults compared to children and adolescents depend on the specific condition that is causing the anxiety. For example, symptoms of social phobia or specific phobia are quite similar in children and ''teens'' compared to adults except that children and teens are less likely to recognize that their thoughts or behaviors are irrational. Symptoms of anxiety in children and teens tend to be consistent with how they express feelings in general. For example, younger children are less able to express feelings verbally compared to older children, and thus tend to express anxiety by complaining of physical symptoms like stomach upset or ''headaches''. They are also more likely to cry, have tantrums, or become clingy. In contrast to younger children, teens tend to express symptoms of anxiety similarly to adults. However, adolescents are more likely than adults to exhibit anxiety by becoming irritable or angry. Anxious teens are also more likely to have wide ''mood swings'' from normal (euthymic) to anxious, angry, and irritable.''Anxiety disorders are diagnosed in women about twice as often as in men. It is difficult to determine if women are more susceptible to anxiety disorders, or if men are less likely to acknowledge or report symptoms and are thus diagnosed less often. Similarly, differences in how men and women experience or recognize anxiety symptoms may also influence anxiety disorder diagnoses.''Studies indicate that men seem to experience effects of anxiety differently compared to women. Specifically, men tend to exhibit more psychological symptoms of anxiety, like tension, irritability, and a sense of impending doom. In contrast, women tend to develop more physical symptoms like ''chest pain'', ''palpitations'', ''insomnia'', shortness of breath, and ''nausea''. Further, it seems that women with such physical symptoms of anxiety are more at risk for developing heart problems.'   restlessness or feeling edgy; becoming tired easily, fatigue; trouble concentrating, that may also appear as memory or attention problems; feeling as if the mind is going ""blank""; irritability; muscle tension; headaches; sleep problems (trouble falling or staying asleep or having sleep that is not restful). palpitations (feelings of rapid and/or irregular heartbeats); chest pain, chest tightness or other discomfort, feeling like one is having a heart attack; shortness of breath or trouble breathing; sweating of the palms; nausea or other stomach upset; trembling or shaking; feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feeling detached from oneself); fear of losing control or going insane; numbness or tingling sensations; chills or hot flashes; feeling like one is choking; a sense of impending doom; feeling like one is dying."
When should people seek treatment for anxiety?,"""Everyone experiences some symptoms of anxiety, but most often, this occurs in very serious situations. When the symptoms are triggered by normal events that aren't dangerous, or they don't settle down in a reasonable amount of time, you may have an anxiety disorder. Similarly, if the anxiety symptoms are getting in the way of your daily life, consider seeking a formal evaluation, and possible treatment, for an anxiety disorder. Not treating an anxiety disorder can impair your overall well-being, cause self-doubt, and may increase your risk of ""'depression'', ''substance abuse'', and even ''suicide''.' "
What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?,"'Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder that is characterized by multiple and/or nonspecific worries. GAD often starts early in life, and people with this diagnosis will often describe being anxious, or being a ""worrier,"" for most of their life. The fear associated with GAD interferes with the person\'s ability to ''sleep'', think, or function in some other way. Symptoms of anxiety are even described in the word itself. Specifically, the word anxiety comes from the Latin word ''anxietas'', which means to choke or upset. The symptoms therefore include emotional or behavioral symptoms as well as ways of thinking that are responses to feeling as if one is in danger.' "
How common is generalized anxiety disorder?,"'GAD is quite common. In fact, it is the most common anxiety disorder seen by most primary care doctors. Up to 9% of people will develop GAD over the course of their lifetime. That translates to millions of GAD sufferers. During any given year in the U.S., up to 0.9% of adolescents (about one in 100) and 2.9% of adults (about one in 30) will have GAD. The prevalence of GAD peaks in middle age and declines in later years. Women are about twice as likely to develop GAD as men. Individuals from developed countries are more likely to report symptoms of GAD than those from non-developed countries.' "
Are other mental health diagnoses associated with generalized anxiety disorder?,"'When people receive a GAD diagnosis, they commonly have (or had) other anxiety disorders. Individuals with GAD very commonly will also have major ''depressive episodes'' (unipolar ''depression''; ""''clinical depression''"") during their life. GAD is not associated with an increased risk of having a substance use disorder, ''bipolar disorder'', or a psychotic disorder. However, some symptoms of GAD are very common in other disorders, including PTSD, panic disorder, ''bipolar disorder'', and ''psychotic disorders'' (such as ''schizophrenia''). However, part of a complete mental health evaluation should be confirming that the diagnosis of GAD is not better explained by another diagnosis.' "
What are causes and risk factors for generalized anxiety disorder?,"'While there is no single cause of GAD, some people are more at risk for developing anxiety than others. Women tend to develop this condition and most other anxiety disorders more often than men, and individuals with a family history of anxiety and ''depression'' are more at risk for having GAD. Genetic factors (for example, a family history of anxiety and/or ''depression'') are thought to explain about one-third of the risk for GAD. Younger adults are more likely to have GAD or social anxiety disorder compared to older adults. Other risk factors for developing social anxiety disorder include being of Native-American ethnicity and having a low income. Being of Asian, Hispanic, or black ethnicity, as well as residing in a more populated region, seems to reduce the risk of social anxiety disorder.''Inhibited temperament, parental anxiety, and having family and friends who somehow support avoidant coping mechanisms are risk factors for developing an anxiety disorder. Adolescents who smoke tobacco have been found to be at risk for developing anxiety. In children, girls, particularly those who begin ''puberty'' early, seem to be more likely to develop anxiety than their age peers of both genders.''Life ''stress'', involving health problems and family disagreements, has been found to be associated with developing an anxiety disorder. Certain other life stresses put people at risk for developing anxiety, as well. For example, in a study of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and non-Hispanic white individuals, non-race-based discrimination was found to be a risk factor for developing anxiety in each of those groups while race-based discrimination was found to increase the likelihood of only the African-American people in developing anxiety.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?,"'According to the ''DSM-5'', the diagnosis GAD requires the following criteria, which must be present at least six months for more than half of the time:''If a health care professional suspects that you have GAD, you will likely undergo an extensive medical interview and physical examination. As part of this examination, you may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess your risk of anxiety. The answers to these questions will help assess whether you meet the diagnostic criteria for GAD (as described above). Because anxiety may be associated with a number of other medical illnesses or can be a side effect of various medications, routine laboratory tests are often performed during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of your symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed.' Excessive anxiety and worry. Worry is about a number of events or activities (for example, work or school performance, relationships, social functioning; worry not limited just to one topic). The worry is difficult to control. The anxiety and worry are associated with at least three of the following symptoms:Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edgeEasily fatiguedDifficulty concentrating or mind going blankIrritabilityMuscle tensionSleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep; or restless, unsatisfying sleep) Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge Easily fatigued Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank Irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep; or restless, unsatisfying sleep) The anxiety, worry, and/or physical symptoms cause significant distress and/or impairment. Impairment may be in social, occupational, or other important aspects of life. The anxiety and worry are not better explained by a medical condition, a substance (drug of abuse or medication). They are also not better explained by a different psychiatric diagnosis."
What types of specialists treat generalized anxiety disorder?,"'Many health care professionals may help determine the diagnosis and recommend treatment for individuals with GAD; these include licensed mental health therapists, family physicians, or other primary care professionals, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers.' "
What are the treatment options for anxiety?,"'There are a variety of treatments available for controlling anxiety, including several effective anti-anxiety medications and specific forms of psychotherapy. In terms of medications, ''buspirone'' (BuSpar) is known to be quite effective for treating GAD. However, it seems to be less effective in managing many other disorders that often co-occur (are comorbid) with GAD. Therefore, specific members of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) and the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes of drugs, which are also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effective treatment of GAD, are prescribed more often. Examples of SRI medications include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''). Examples of SNRI medications are ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), and ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''). Some of the newer ''antidepressants'' work in a similar way to SRI and SNRI medications but do not yet have an FDA approval for treatment of GAD. Some of these newer medications are ''mirtazapine'' (''Remeron''), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), vilazodone (Viibryd), and ''vortioxetine'' (''Brintellix'').''Benzodiazepine'' medications like clonazepam (Klonopin) and lorazepam (Ativan) are ''sedatives'' sometimes used for treating anxiety. They may be more effective for short-term use (for example, weeks to months), or occasional use in stopping severe anxiety symptoms, like those that occur in panic attacks, rather than the ongoing worry that is usually associated with GAD. Although alprazolam (Xanax) is often used to treat panic attacks, its short duration of action can sometimes result in having to take it several times per day, increasing the risk of tolerance and ''addiction''. Another benzodiazepine, ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), tends to be used less often due to concerns about its long duration of action and addiction potential. Use of benzodiazepines is somewhat controversial; many doctors are reluctant to use them because of the risk of abuse and dependence, and/or withdrawal. There is also some clinical research that suggests PTSD and anxiety disorders may be harder to control later if benzodiazepines are used.''Because of the link between the autonomic nervous system and the fight-or-flight response in anxiety, medications that block this response may be helpful. One example is the ''beta-blocker'' family of medications usually used for ''high blood pressure''. ''Beta-blockers'' stop some of the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) that also is involved in anxiety and fear responses. Beta-blockers such as ''propranolol'' (''Inderal'') are sometimes used to decrease episodic anxiety (for example, performance anxiety or test anxiety), and may also relieve some of the physical symptoms associated with a ''panic attack''.'""In addition to these medications, a variety of other medication classes are sometimes used to help treat anxiety. Although they don't have a specific approval for treating anxiety from the FDA, people may discuss the risks and benefits with their prescribing doctor and decide which medications may be right for them. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a medication developed as a ""'seizure'' medication but has been found to help some individuals with severe anxiety symptoms. Gabapentin may be a less addictive option compared to benzodiazepines. Older sedating anti-histamine medications, such as ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril''), are another nonaddictive type of medication that may be useful for panic attacks or severe episodes of anxiety.''When anxiety disorders are difficult to treat, or an individual has side effects with an SRI/SNRI, they may decide with their doctor to try one of the newer antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medications. This class includes ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), paliperidone (Invega), and lurasidone (''Latuda''). There are a number of ''clinical trials'' showing some reduction of anxiety symptoms from these medications. However, they also have significant possible side effects and require ongoing monitoring by the patient and their doctor.''Zolpidem'' (''Ambien'') and ''trazodone'' (''Desyrel'') have been found helpful in treating the ''insomnia'' that can often be a symptom of anxiety.''Before SRIs and SNRIs became available, older ''antidepressant'' medications including the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (''MAOI'') classes were often used to treat anxiety disorders. Although both of these medication classes have been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders, the newer classes of medications (SRIs and SNRIs) have been proven to be safer and better tolerated. Therefore, TCAs and ''MAOIs'' are used much less often than they used to be. When used in the appropriate person with close monitoring, these medications can be quite effective as part of treatment for panic disorder.'  "
What are the side effects of anxiety medications?,"'All medications, prescribed or over the counter, carry a risk of side effects, and it is important for the person with an anxiety disorder to work closely with their prescribing doctor to decide whether treatment with medications is an appropriate intervention and if so, which medication should be administered. The kinds of side effects caused by a medication are highly specific to the medication itself and each medication class as a whole. The person being treated should therefore discuss potential medications with their treating physician and be closely monitored for the possibility of side effects that can vary from minor to severe and can uncommonly even be life threatening.''The degree of risk from medications to the fetus of a ''pregnant'"" woman is often not fully known. Some anxiety medications do have known risks for a fetus. Many pregnant women also have strong beliefs or fears about taking medication while pregnant. For each of these reasons, the decision of whether or not to take a medication for anxiety should be made by the woman with her prescribing physician (the woman's obstetrician, or in consultation with her obstetrician). Treatment for anxiety can be individualized and may include psychotherapy alone or combined with medications. Similarly, women who are trying to become pregnant, or who may become pregnant, should consult with their doctor about what treatment choices are best for them.""'For people who may be wondering how to treat anxiety without prescribed medications, natural remedies available over the counter may be an option. Alternative and complementary treatment methods such as hypnosis, ''acupuncture'', and herbal ''supplements'' (such as ''kava'', ''valerian'', or passionflower) have been found to be helpful for some people with some anxiety disorders, but the research data are still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend them. Also, care should be taken when taking any ''dietary supplements'', since dietary ''supplements'' and ""natural"" remedies are not regulated in terms of quality, content, or effectiveness.''The psychotherapy component of treatment for anxiety disorders is at least as important as the medication treatment. In fact, research shows that counseling alone or the combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment are more effective than medication alone in overcoming anxiety for both adults and children. It has also been found to be potentially effective for people with ''autism'' in addition to anxiety. The most common type of therapy used to treat anxiety is ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT''). This form of therapy seeks to help those with an anxiety disorder identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce anxiety symptoms and can be administered either individually, in group therapy, and even in partner-assisted therapy. Recently, there have also been more online options for CBT available to treat both anxiety and depression. CBT that seeks to help the anxiety sufferer decrease the tendency to pay excessive attention to potential threats has also been found to be helpful.''Behavioral techniques that are often used to decrease anxiety include relaxation techniques and gradually increasing exposure to situations that may have previously precipitated anxiety in the individual. Another name for this type of psychotherapy is exposure therapy. Helping the anxiety sufferer to understand and how to handle the emotional forces that may have contributed to developing symptoms (anxiety-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy) has also been found to be effective in teaching an individual with panic disorder how to prevent an anxiety attack or to decrease or stop a panic attack once it starts. Other commonly available psychotherapy approaches can also improve symptoms of anxiety. Therapies focused on well-being, including mindfulness-based individual or group therapies, are a widely available option.''Often, a combination of psychotherapy and medications produces good results. Improvement is usually noticed in a fairly short period of time, about two to three months, although a full response (or remission of symptoms) usually takes longer. Thus, appropriate treatment for anxiety can prevent symptoms or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency, bringing significant relief to many people with anxiety.''There are also self-care measures that people with anxiety can do to help make treatment more effective. Since substances like ''caffeine'', alcohol, and illicit drugs can worsen anxiety, those things should be avoided. Other tips to prevent or manage anxiety symptoms include engaging in ''aerobic exercise'' and stress-management techniques like deep breathing, ''massage'' therapy, and ''yoga'', since these self-help and well-being activities have also been found to help decrease the frequency and severity of symptoms. Although many people breathe into a paper bag when afflicted by the ''hyperventilation'' that can be associated with panic, the benefit received may be the result of the individual believing it will remedy the symptoms (placebo effect). Also, breathing into a paper bag when one is having trouble breathing can make matters worse when the hyperventilation is the result of conditions of oxygen deprivation, as occurs with an ''asthma attack'' or a heart attack.''People with an anxiety disorder may also need treatment for other emotional problems. Depression has often been associated with anxiety, as have alcohol and ''drug abuse''. Recent research also suggests that ''suicide'' attempts are more frequent in people with an anxiety disorder. Fortunately, these problems associated with panic disorder can be overcome effectively, just like panic disorder itself. Sadly, many people with anxiety do not seek or receive treatment.' "
What are complications of generalized anxiety disorder?,"'There are many possible complications associated with anxiety. Mothers who struggle with anxiety during ''pregnancy'' are more likely to have ''babies'' who are of low birth weight. Children with anxiety often also suffer from depression, behavioral problems like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), as well as substance abuse. They are at risk for having anxiety as adults, as well as attempting suicide and becoming psychiatrically hospitalized. In terms of achievement, children and teens with anxiety experience a higher rate of failing in school and having low-paying jobs as adults.' "
Is it possible to prevent anxiety?,"'Just as inhibited temperament, parental anxiety, and family and friends supporting avoidant coping mechanisms are risk factors for developing an anxiety disorder, encouraging the use of healthier ways to deal with stress can be of great help in the ''prevention'' of anxiety. Educating parents on how anxiety fits into their understanding of childhood development and the role of overprotecting parents in developing anxiety disorders have been found to help prevent anxiety disorders in children. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a regular ''exercise'' program, eating a balanced ''diet'', and getting adequate sleep can be key to minimizing and perhaps preventing anxiety.' "
What is the prognosis of generalized anxiety disorder?,"'Generalized anxiety disorder is often longstanding or lifelong, particularly without treatment. It can significantly interfere with the lives of individuals who have it and usually requires treatment for it to resolve. Therefore, people with generalized anxiety disorder are usually thought to need treatment for at least a year to prevent its recurrence, and some individuals may need to stay in treatment over the long term.' "
Are there support groups for those with generalized anxiety disorder?,"'The following are examples of support groups for anxiety disorders:''ABIL, Inc.

What is separation anxiety disorder?,"""To understand separation anxiety disorder, it is important to first recognize the normal difficulty that infants and toddlers have with strangers and in separating from parents and caretakers. Infants show stranger anxiety by crying when someone unfamiliar to them approaches. This normal stage of development is connected with the baby learning to distinguish his or her parents or other familiar caretakers from people they don't know. Stranger anxiety usually starts at about 8 months of age and ends by the time the child is 2 years old, according to the American Academy of ""'Pediatrics''.''Separation anxiety as a normal life stage first develops at about 7 months of age, once a baby understands that his or her caregivers do not disappear when out of sight (object permanence). That leads to the baby developing a true attachment to those adults. Normal separation anxiety is most commonly at its strongest at 10-18 months of age and gradually subsides, usually by the time the child is 3 years old. Normal separation anxiety may result in parents having trouble with their ''babies'' at bedtime or other times of separation, in that the child becomes anxious, cries, or clings to the caretaker.'""In addition to the child's temperament, factors that contribute to how quickly or successfully he or she moves past separation anxiety by preschool age include how well the parent and child reunite, the skills the child and adult have at coping with the separation, and how well the adult responds to the infant's separation issues. For example, children of anxious parents tend to be anxious children.""'Separation anxiety disorder is a mental health disorder that usually begins in childhood and is characterized by worrying that is out of proportion to the situation of temporarily leaving home or otherwise separating from loved ones. Approximately 4%-5% of children and adolescents suffer from separation anxiety disorder.'  "
What are separation anxiety disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of separation anxiety disorder may include''Examples of behavioral symptoms that children may exhibit to express the anxiety, hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal of events that separate them from loved ones include crying, having tantrums, whining, or begging. Examples of physical symptoms that separation anxiety disorder sufferers may have include stomach upset, ''headaches'', and ''diarrhea''. To qualify for the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, a minimum of three of the above symptoms must persist for at least a month in children and adolescents and at least six months in adults, and cause significant ''stress'"" or problems with school, social relationships, or some other area of the sufferer's life. Also, the disorder is not considered to be present if symptoms only take place when the person is suffering from certain other mental-health problems, such as ""'schizophrenia'' or from a specific kind of developmental disability called pervasive developmental disorder. School refusal, also called school phobia, may be a symptom of separation anxiety disorder, but it can also occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders and is not a diagnosis by itself.''Social phobia'', also an anxiety disorder, differs from separation anxiety disorder in that social phobia is characterized by severe fear of most, if not all, social situations, not just events that result in separating from primary caregivers. This illness affects about 1% of children and adolescents and up to 5% of adults.'""Individuals with social phobia may be children, teenagers, or adults, and the anxiety may interfere with the person's ability to function. Children with this problem may have difficulty with a number of ordinary activities, such as playing with their peers, talking in class, or speaking to adults.""   repeated excessive anxiety about something bad happening to loved ones or losing them; heightened concern about either getting lost or being kidnapped; repeated hesitancy or refusal to go to day care or school or to be alone or without loved ones or other adults who are important to the anxious child; persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep at night without being physically close to adult loved ones; repeated nightmares about being separated from the people who are important to the sufferer; recurrent physical complaints, such as headaches or stomachaches, when separation either occurs or is expected."
What are causes and risk factors for separation anxiety disorder?,"'Separation anxiety disorder (as with most mental-health conditions) is likely caused by the combination of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities rather than by any one thing.''In addition to being more common in children with family histories of anxiety, children whose mothers were stressed during pregnancy with them tend to be more at risk for developing this disorder.''A majority of children with separation anxiety disorder have school refusal as a symptom and up to 80% of children who refuse school qualify for the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Approximately 50%-75% of children who suffer from this disorder come from homes of low socioeconomic status.'  "
How is separation anxiety disorder diagnosed?,"'Health-care professionals who have training and experience understanding symptoms of children and adolescents are usually the most qualified to assess separation anxiety disorder. The assessment most often involves a pediatrician and child psychologist, child psychiatrist, or other mental-health professional interviewing both the child and his or her parent(s) when assessing separation anxiety disorder. Those interviews often take place separately to allow everyone to speak freely. This is particularly important given how differently children and their parents may see the situation and how difficult it can be for children to hear their problems discussed. In addition to asking about specific symptoms of anxiety, the professional will likely explore whether the child has symptoms of any other mental-health issues and will recommend that the child receive a full physical examination and lab work to ensure that there is no medical reason for the issues the child is experiencing.' "
What is the treatment for separation anxiety disorder?,"'Counseling, rather than medication, is the treatment of choice for separation anxiety disorder that is mild in severity. For children who either have not improved with counseling alone, suffer from more severe symptoms, have other emotional problems in addition to separation disorder, treatment should consist of a combination of approaches. ''Psychotherapy'', medication, and parent counseling are three interventions that have been found to be effective for the treatment of separation anxiety disorder, particularly in combination.'""Behavioral modification therapy is an intervention that directly addresses the behavioral symptoms of separation anxiety disorder. This intervention tends to be more effective and less burdensome to the child if behaviors are addressed positively rather than negatively. The child is not usually punished for continuing to suffer from symptoms but rewarded for small victories over symptoms. For example, instead of withholding dessert from a preschooler who refuses to go into her room for bedtime, give hugs and praise for the child when she can go near her room at first, followed by being able to go in and stay for five minutes, increasing the length of time she needs to be in her room before being praised. Even if she needs significant parental support at first (for example, sitting in the room with her on the parent's lap, then next to her, then just outside the room after she becomes comfortable with each step), this approach allows the child to feel a sense of success at every step and build on it rather than experiencing a sense of failure, which tends to lower the child's likelihood of being able to overcome her anxiety. The implementation of behavioral therapy generally involves the practitioner providing ""'parenting'"" tips to the child's caregivers, regular meetings with the child, and may include guidance to teachers on how to help alleviate the child's anxiety.""'Cognitive therapy is used to help children learn how they think and increase their ability to solve problems and focus on the positive things that are going on, even in the midst of their anxiety. By learning to focus on more positive thoughts and feelings, children may become more open to learning strategies to deal with anxiety, such as playing games, coloring, watching television, or listening to music. Although formal relaxation techniques such as imagining themselves in a relaxing situation may be considered more appropriate interventions for older children, adolescents, and adults, even toddlers can be taught simple relaxation techniques, such as imitating their parents, taking deep breaths, or slowly counting to 10 as ways of calming themselves.'""If psychotherapy is unsuccessful or if the children's symptoms are so severe that they are nearly incapacitating, medication is considered a viable option. However, there are no medications specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat separation anxiety disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluvoxamine (""'Luvox'') have been found to be an effective treatment for separation anxiety disorder.''SSRIs are medications that increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. These medications work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain. This block occurs at the synapse, the place where brain cells (neurons) are connected to each other. Serotonin is one of the chemicals in the brain that carries messages across these connections (synapses) from one neuron to another.''The SSRIs work by keeping serotonin present in high concentrations in the synapses. These ''drugs'"" do this by preventing the reuptake of serotonin back into the sending nerve cell. The reuptake of serotonin is responsible for turning off the production of new serotonin. Therefore, the serotonin message keeps on coming through. It is thought that this, in turn, helps arouse (activate) cells that have been deactivated by anxiety, thereby relieving a child's anxiety symptoms.""'SSRIs have fewer side effects than the tricyclic ''antidepressants'' (TCAs). These medications do not tend to cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (a sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing) or ''heart'' rhythm disturbances, like the TCAs. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line medication treatment for separation anxiety disorder. Examples of SSRIs include''SSRIs are generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', agitation, ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. Side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The ''serotonin syndrome'' (also called serotonergic [caused by serotonin] syndrome) is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs, characterized by high ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart rhythm disturbances. There has also been heightened concern that children and adolescents are at increased risk of having the rare reaction of feeling acutely (suddenly and significantly) more anxious or newly ''depressed'', even to the point of wanting, planning, attempting or in extremely rare cases, completing ''suicide'' or homicide. Serotonin syndrome, as well as acute worsening of emotional symptoms, is very rare.'""All people are unique biochemically so the occurrence of side effects or the lack of a satisfactory result with one SSRI does not mean another medication in this group will not be beneficial. However, if someone in the patient's family had a positive response to a particular drug, that drug may be preferable to try first. Medications that are sometimes considered in treating separation anxiety disorder when SSRIs either don't work or are poorly tolerated include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and benzodiazepines. These medications were developed in the 1950s and 1960s to treat ""'depression''. TCAs work mainly by increasing the level of norepinephrine in the brain synapses, although they also may affect serotonin levels. Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include''TCAs are generally safe and well tolerated when properly prescribed and administered. Overdose of TCAs can cause life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances. Rarely, this can occur even if an overdose is not taken. Some TCAs can also have anticholinergic side effects, which are due to the blocking of the activity of the nerves that are responsible for control of the heart rate, gut motion, visual focus, and saliva production. Thus, some TCAs can produce ''dry mouth'', ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'', and ''dizziness'' upon standing. The ''dizziness'' results from ''low blood pressure''. TCAs should also be avoided in patients with ''seizure disorders'' or a history of ''strokes''.''Benzodiazepines tend to be the least-prescribed group of medications to children suffering from separation anxiety disorder. This group of medications is thought to work by increasing the activity of calming chemicals in the brain. Benzodiazepines include ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), and ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''). Unfortunately, there is a possible risk of the child becoming dependent on benzodiazepines. These medications tend to only be used as a last resort, when the child has had unsuccessful trials of the other two classes of medications or suffers from incapacitating symptoms of anxiety.'  fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), vortioxetine (Brintellix). amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil)."
What happens if separation anxiety disorder is left untreated?,"'Potential complications of separation anxiety disorder include ''depression'' and anxiety problems as adults, as well as personality disorders, in which anxiety is a major symptom.

Introduction to aortic dissection,"'The aorta is the large blood vessel that leads from the ''heart'' and carries blood to the rest of the body. It originates at the ''aortic valve'' at the outlet of the ''left ventricle'' of the heart and ascends within the chest to an arch where blood vessels branch off to supply blood flow to the arms and head. The aorta then begins to descend through the chest and into the abdomen where it splits into two iliac arteries that provide blood flow to the legs. Along its descent, more small arteries branch out to supply blood to the stomach, intestine, colon, kidneys, and the spinal cord. Also, at its origin at the aortic valve, coronary arteries branch from the aorta to supply the heart muscle with blood.''The aorta has a thick wall with three layers of tissue that allow the blood vessel to withstand the high pressure that is generated when the heart pumps blood to the body. The three layers are the tunica intima, tunica media, and the tunic adventitia. The intima is the inside layer that is in contact with the blood, the media is in the middle, and the adventitia is the outermost layer.''In an aortic dissection, a small tear occurs in the tunica intima (the inside layer of the aortic wall in contact with blood). Blood can enter this tear and cause the intima layer to strip away from the media layer, in effect dividing the tissue layers of the aortic wall and forming a false channel, or lumen. This channel may be short or may extend the full length of the aorta. Another tear more distal (further along the course of the aorta than the initial tear) in the intima layer can let blood re-enter the true lumen of the aorta.''In some cases, the dissection will cross all three layers of the aortic wall and cause immediate rupture and almost certain death. In most other cases, the blood is contained between the wall layers, usually causing ''pain'' felt in the back or flanks.''While there have been different historic classifications of aortic dissection, the Stanford classification is now most commonly used.''A patient can have a type A dissection, type B dissection, or a combination of both.''Some patients may experience an aortic dissection without ''pain'' and it may be found incidentally on imaging studies performed for other purposes.'   Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta and arch. Type B involves the descending aorta."
What are the causes of aortic dissection?,"'\tIt is uncertain as to why the initial tear (rent) occurs in the intima layer of the aortic wall. Aortic dissection tends to occur most commonly in men between the ages of 50 and 70.''''High blood pressure'':'' Most cases are associated with ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). The aorta has to withstand significant pressure changes with each heartbeat, and it may be that over time with ''hypertension'', a weakening of an area of the intima will occur.''\tSome conditions increase the risk of aortic dissection or are associated with the condition, including:''''Pregnancy'':'' Pregnancy is a rare associated risk factor, especially in the ''third trimester'' and early in the postpartum period.''''Trauma'':'"" Blunt trauma is known to cause aortic dissection, which is often seen after car wrecks in which the patient's chest hits the steering wheel.""'''Surgical complications:'' Aortic dissection can be a complication of medical operations including ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting and aortic and ''mitral valve'' repairs. It can also be a complication of heart catheterization.'

What are the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection?,"   Pain is the most common symptom of aortic dissection and is often described as tearing or ripping and often begins suddenly. If the aortic dissection occurs in the chest, the pain is usually centered in the chest and radiates directly into the upper back. If the dissection occurs in the abdominal aorta, the pain may occur in the mid back or low back and radiate to the flanks. There may be associated nausea, sweating, shortness of breath, and weakness. The patient may pass out (syncope). Other symptoms may be related to the location of the dissection within the aorta and whether it affects some of the branch arteries and occludes their blood supply. For example, if an artery that supplies blood to the brain is involved, there may be signs of stroke. Or if the dissection affects the anterior spinal artery and blood supply to the spinal cord, the patient may present with paraplegia.  The coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart begin at the origin of the aorta at the aortic valve. If the coronary arteries are involved, the aortic dissection may cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction) as its presenting symptom. The patient may present with congestive heart failure with fluid building up in the lungs. If the aortic dissection involves the aortic valve and causes it to fail, blood flows back into the heart with each beat and causes blood flow to back up into the lungs.  The pain of aortic dissection can be confused with that of heart attack, but can sometimes be distinguished because of its sudden onset, potentially normal electrocardiogram, and abnormal findings on chest X-ray. The pain of an abdominal aortic dissection can be confused with the pain caused by a kidney stone. The diagnosis is made when a CT scan looking for the kidney stone reveals an aneurysm instead.
 The patient may also have a sense of impending doom."
How is aortic dissection diagnosed?,"'The health care professional should always be suspicious of aortic dissection as one of the three major causes of ''chest pain'' that can cause death, in addition to heart attack and ''pulmonary embolism''.''If the patient has unstable vital signs, poor ''breathing'', abnormal pulse, ''low blood pressure'', and/or a decreased level of consciousness, the ABCs of resuscitation (''Airway'', Breathing, Circulation) need to be addressed while the evaluation of the patient continues. ''Patient History''The history is one of the important first steps in trying to make the diagnosis. It is important to consider not only the symptoms but also the risk factors of high ''blood pressure'', genetic or family history, and the presence of other medical conditions that may predispose the patient to aortic dissection.''Physical examination may show potential complications of the ''aortic aneurysm'' and allow the health care professional to consider this as a potential diagnosis. Again, the presenting symptoms will depend upon the location of the dissection and what organs are involved. Symptoms, depending on the location of the dissection, may include:''The initial tests for ''chest pain'', an electrocardiogram and a chest X-ray, are usually done. Unless the dissection involves the coronary arteries, the electrocardiogram is usually normal. The chest X-ray may show an abnormal shape to the aorta and a widened mediastinum (that space where the heart, aorta, vena cava, trachea, and ''esophagus'' sit in the chest ''cavity'').''The diagnostic test of choice is an aortic ''angiogram'' using ''computerized tomography'' of the chest and abdomen. This test requires a contrast dye injection and visualizes the aorta and other blood vessels that branch off from it. Alternatively, for those people who cannot undergo computerized tomography, transesophageal ''echocardiography'' is an option. A cardiologist puts an ''ultrasound'' probe through the mouth into the esophagus and can identify potential problems with the heart, heart valves, and the aorta.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') can also be used, but is not often technically easily available with unstable patients and takes much longer to perform than a CT scan.'   Blood pressure discrepancy between the arms Pulse delay between arms and legs Listening for fluid in the lung or for a new heart murmur that may help assess the aortic valve  New stroke symptoms  Paraplegia"
What is the treatment for aortic dissection?,"'The ABCs of resuscitation are always a priority.''In the emergency department, intravenous lines will be placed, monitors for heart rate and rhythm will be attached, and supplemental oxygen will be provided. Treatment and diagnostic testing usually occur at the same time until the final diagnosis is established and definitive treatment is required.''The initial medications used for treatment of an aortic dissection are directed at lowering the blood pressure to prevent further tearing or damage to the aorta. Beta blocker medications (for example, esmolol [Brevibloc], ''labetalol'' [''Normodyne'', ''Trandate''], ''metoprolol'' [''Lopressor'', ''Toprol XL'']) decrease the adrenaline action on the heart and blood vessels. ''Nitroglycerin'' dilates blood vessels to decrease blood pressure. These medications cannot be used if the patient is in ''shock'' with ''low blood pressure'"" because of the aortic dissection. Specific medication combinations will depend upon the patient's needs.""'Ultimately, type A aortic dissections of the ascending aorta require surgery as the treatment of choice. The area of the aorta that is damaged is replaced with an artificial graft. If the aortic valve has been damaged, it too may need replacement or repair.''Medical management (nonsurgical) is usually preferred for type B dissection of the descending aorta, but again, each patient needs to be assessed individually as to the specific treatment suggested. Medications are prescribed to aggressively control high blood pressure to prevent further dissection and aortic injury.'  "
What is the prognosis for aortic dissection?,"'For aortic rupture, in which all three layers of the aorta are disrupted, the mortality (death) rate is up to 80% of patients. Forty percent of these patients die before reaching a hospital.''For type A aortic dissection, the mortality rate remains high, with up to a 30% death rate after surgery.''Type B aortic dissections, treated medically, have an initial death rate of 10%. This compares to a 25% mortality when treated surgically.''Overall, for both types of aortic dissection, the 10-year survival rate is more than 60%.' "
Can aortic dissection be prevented?,"'As with any disease involving blood vessels, prevention is key. Controlling high blood pressure, ''diabetes'', cholesterol, and avoiding ''smoking'' decreases the risk of all blood vessel disease. Because the majority of patients with aortic dissection have ''hypertension'', controlling high blood pressure (one risk factor) may decrease the risk of this disease.''The use of screening ultrasound to look for ''abdominal aortic aneurysm'"" is somewhat controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends a one-time ultrasound screening for males aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked. There is no recommendation for men who don't smoke. They recommend against screening for women because of the rarity of abdominal aortic ""'aneurysm'' in women.''Any chest pain should not be ignored and medical care should be accessed immediately by activating the emergency medical services system and calling 9-1-1.''Since the cause of the chest pain may be unknown, giving a baby ''aspirin'' to the patient is appropriate, as is providing nitroglycerin (if the patient has been prescribed this medication for chest pain).' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is aortic stenosis?,"'Aortic stenosis is abnormal narrowing of the aortic valve. A number of conditions cause disease resulting in narrowing of the aortic valve. When the degree of narrowing becomes significant enough to impede the flow of blood from the ''left ventricle'' to the arteries, heart problems develop.''The flow of blood to the arteries of the body is impaired when aortic stenosis exists. Ultimately, this can lead to heart failure. Aortic stenosis occurs three times more commonly in men than women.' The heart is a muscular pump with four chambers and four heart valves. The upper chambers, the right atrium and left atrium (atria -- plural for atrium), are thin walled filling chambers. Blood flows from the right and left atria across the tricuspid and mitral valves into the lower chambers (right and left ventricles). The right and left ventricles have thick muscular walls for pumping blood across the pulmonic and aortic valves into the circulation. Heart valves are thin leaflets of tissue which open and close at the proper time during each heart beat cycle. The main function of these heart valves is to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Blood circulates through the arteries to provide oxygen and other nutrients to the body, and then returns with carbon dioxide waste through the veins to the right atrium; when the ventricles relax, blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. When the ventricles contract, blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonic valve into the lungs to reload on oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium and passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. Blood is pumped by the left ventricle across the aortic valve into the aorta and the arteries of the body."
What are the symptoms of aortic stenosis?,"'The major symptoms of aortic stenosis are:''In a low percentage of the patients with aortic stenosis, the first symptom is sudden death, usually during strenuous exertion.''The exact reason for sudden death is unknown. It may be due to heart rhythm abnormalities secondary to inadequate blood flow through the narrowed aortic valve into the coronary arteries of the heart. Insufficient oxygen to the inner lining of the heart muscle occurs do to the lack of blood flow to the coronary arteries, particularly during strenuous ''exercise''. Lack of oxygen in the heart muscles causes chest ''pain'' and possibly ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Chest ''pain'' is the first symptom in one-third of patients and eventually occurs in one-half of patients with aortic stenosis. Chest pain in patients with aortic stenosis is the same as chest pain (angina) experienced by patients with ''coronary artery disease''. In both of these conditions, pain is described as pressure below the breast bone brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. In patients with ''coronary artery disease'', chest pain is due to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscles because of narrowed coronary arteries. In patients with aortic stenosis, chest pain often occurs without any underlying narrowing of the coronary arteries. The thickened heart muscle must pump against high pressure to push blood through the narrowed aortic valve. This increases heart muscle oxygen demand in excess of the supply delivered in the blood, causing chest pain (angina).'""Fainting (syncope) related to aortic stenosis is usually associated with exertion or excitement. These conditions cause relaxation of the body's blood vessels (vasodilation), ""'lowering blood pressure''. In aortic stenosis, the heart is unable to increase output to compensate for the drop in ''blood pressure''. Therefore, blood flow to the brain is decreased, causing fainting. Fainting can also occur when cardiac output is decreased by an irregular heart beat (''arrhythmia''). Without effective treatment, the average life expectancy is less than 3 years after the onset of chest pain or syncope symptoms.'""Shortness of breath from heart failure is the most ominous sign. It reflects the heart muscle's failure to compensate for the extreme pressure load of aortic stenosis. Shortness of breath is caused by increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lung due to the increased pressure required to fill the left ventricle. Initially, shortness of breath occurs only during activity. As the disease progresses, shortness of breath occurs at rest. Patients can find it difficult to lie flat without becoming short of breath (orthopnea). Without treatment, the average life expectancy after the onset of heart failure due to aortic stenosis is between 6 to 24 months.""   chest pain (angina), fainting (syncope), and shortness of breath (due to heart failure)."
What causes aortic stenosis?,"'In adults, three conditions are known to cause aortic stenosis.''Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients under age 65. Normal aortic valves have three thin leaflets called cusps. About 2% of people are born with aortic valves that have only two cusps (bicuspid valves). Although bicuspid valves usually do not impede blood flow when the patients are young, they do not open as widely as normal valves with three cusps. Therefore, blood flow across the bicuspid valves is more turbulent, causing increased wear and tear on the valve leaflets. Over time, excessive wear and tear leads to calcification, scarring, and reduced mobility of the valve leaflets. About 10% of bicuspid valves become significantly narrowed, resulting in the symptoms and heart problems of aortic stenosis.''The most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients 65 years of age and over is called ""senile calcific aortic stenosis."" With ''aging'', protein collagen of the valve leaflets is destroyed, and calcium is deposited on the leaflets. Turbulence across the valve increases causing scarring, thickening, and stenosis of the valve once valve leaflet mobility is reduced by calcification. Why this ''aging'' process progresses to cause significant aortic stenosis in some patients but not in others is unknown. The progressive disease causing aortic calcification and stenosis has nothing to with healthy lifestyle choices, unlike the calcium that can deposit in the coronary artery to cause ''heart attack''.''Rheumatic ''fever'' is a condition resulting from untreated infection by group A streptococcal bacteria. Damage to valve leaflets from rheumatic ''fever'' causes increased turbulence across the valve and more damage. The narrowing from rheumatic fever occurs from the fusion (melting together) of the edges (commissures) of the valve leaflets. Rheumatic aortic stenosis usually occurs with some degree of aortic regurgitation. Under normal circumstances, the aortic valve closes to prevent blood in the aorta from flowing back into the left ventricle. In aortic regurgitation, the diseased valve allows leakage of blood back into the left ventricle as the ventricular muscles relax after pumping. These patients also have some degree of rheumatic damage to the mitral valve. Rheumatic ''heart disease'' is a relatively uncommon occurrence in the United States, except in people who have immigrated from underdeveloped countries.'   Progressive wear and tear of a bicuspid valve present since birth (congenital). Wear and tear of the aortic valve in the elderly. Scarring of the aortic valve due to rheumatic fever as a child or young adult."
How does aortic stenosis affect the left ventricle pump?,"'Symptoms and heart problems in aortic stenosis are related to the degree of narrowing of the aortic valve area. Patients with mild aortic valve narrowing may experience no symptoms. When the narrowing becomes significant (usually greater that 50% reduction in valve area), the pressure in the left ventricle increases and a pressure difference can be measured between the left ventricle and the aorta. An easy way to conceptualize the size issues is to think of a normal aortic valve as being about a ""half-dollar"" size in diameter, and a significantly narrowed valve to be less than a ""dime"" in size. To compensate for the increasing resistance at the aortic valve, the muscles of the left ventricle thicken to maintain pump function and cardiac output. This muscle thickening causes a stiffer heart muscle which requires higher pressures in the left atrium and the blood vessels of the lungs to fill the left ventricle. Even though these patients may be able to maintain adequate and normal cardiac output at rest, the ability of the heart to increase output with ''exercise'' is limited by these high pressures. As the disease progresses the increasing pressure eventually causes the left ventricle to dilate, leading to a decrease in cardiac output and heart failure.'  "
How is aortic stenosis diagnosed?,"'The carotid arteries carry blood from the aorta to the brain and are the closest arteries to the aortic valve that can be felt by the doctor examining the neck. Patients with significant aortic stenosis have a delayed upstroke and lower intensity of the carotid pulse which correlates with the severity of narrowing. Aortic valve stenosis causes significant turbulence to blood flowing during contraction of the left ventricle resulting in a loud murmur. The loudness of the murmur does not, however, correlate with the severity of stenosis. Patients with mild stenosis can have loud murmurs, while patients with severe stenosis and heart failure may not pump enough blood to cause much of a murmur.''Electrocardiogram'' (''EKG''): '""An EKG is a recording of the heart's electrical activity. Abnormal patterns on the EKG can reflect a thickened heart muscle and suggest the diagnosis of aortic stenosis. In rare instances, electrical conduction abnormality can also been seen.""'Chest X-ray'': ''A chest X-ray'' ''usually shows a normal heart shadow. The aorta above the aortic valve is often enlarged (dilated). If heart failure is present, fluid in the lung tissue and larger blood vessels in the upper lung regions are often seen. A careful inspection of the chest X-ray sometimes reveals calcification of the aortic valve.''Echocardiography'':'' Echocardiography uses ''ultrasound'' waves to obtain images of the heart chambers, valves, and surrounding structures. It is a useful non-invasive tool, which helps doctors diagnose aortic valve disease. An echocardiogram can show a thickened, calcified aortic valve which opens poorly. It can also show the size and functioning of the heart chambers. A technique called Doppler can be used to determine the pressure difference on either side of the aortic valve and to estimate the aortic valve area.''Cardiac catheterization: ''Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard in evaluating aortic stenosis. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the aortic valve and into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressures are measured on both sides of the aortic valve. The rate of blood flow across the aortic valve can also be measured using a special catheter. Using these data, the aortic valve area can be calculated. A normal aortic valve area is 3 square centimeters. Symptoms usually occur when the aortic valve area narrows to less than 1 square centimeter. Critical aortic stenosis is present when the valve area is less than 0.7 square centimeters. In patients over 40 years of age, X-ray contrast agents can be injected into the coronary arteries (''coronary angiography'') during cardiac catheterization to evaluate the status of coronary arteries. If significant narrowing of the coronary arteries is found, ''coronary artery bypass graft'' surgery (''CABG'') can be performed during aortic valve replacement surgery.' "
What is the treatment for aortic stenosis?,"'Patients without symptoms can be observed until symptoms develop. Patients with mild aortic stenosis do not require treatment or restriction of activity. Patients with moderate aortic stenosis (valve area 1.5 to 1.0 square centimeters) are advised to avoid strenuous activities such as ''weight lifting'' or sprinting. Aortic stenosis can progress over a few years. Therefore, patients are usually examined annually and evaluated by echocardiography periodically to monitor disease progression. Since valve infection (''endocarditis'') is a serious complication of aortic stenosis, these patients are usually given antibiotics prior to any procedure in which bacteria may be introduced into the bloodstream. This includes routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that may traumatize body tissues such as ''colonoscopy'' and gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') and ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''PCE''), as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'' (Unasyn), gentamicin (''Garamycin''), and ''vancomycin'' (Lyphocin, ''Vancocin'').''When symptoms of chest pain, syncope, or shortness of breath appear, the prognosis for patients with aortic stenosis without valve replacement surgery is poor. Medical therapy, such as the use of diuretics to reduce high lung pressures and remove lung fluid can provide only temporary relief of symptoms. Patients with symptoms usually undergo cardiac catheterization. If severe aortic stenosis is confirmed, aortic valve replacement is usually recommended. The overall mortality risk for aortic valve replacement surgery is about 5%. Advanced age should not be a reason for not recommending aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Otherwise healthy patients in their 80s with strong heart muscles often benefit dramatically from aortic valve replacement for critical aortic stenosis.''Replacement aortic valves processed from pigs (porcine) or cows (bovine) are called bioprostheses. Bioprostheses are less durable than mechanical prostheses (discussed below) but have the advantage of not needing life-long blood thinning (anticoagulation) medication to prevent ''blood clots'' from forming on the valve surfaces. The average life expectancy of an aortic valve bioprostheses is 10 to 15 years. Bioprostheses rapidly calcify, degenerate and narrow in young patients. Therefore, bioprostheses are primarily used on older patients or in patients who cannot take blood thinners. Recently, aortic valves from human cadavers have been used in younger patients to avoid the need for anticoagulation medication. However, the availability of human aortic grafts is limited; though probably better than the other bioprostheses, its long term durability is unknown. The new ""Ross Procedure"" consists of moving the pulmonic valve to the aortic position and replacing the pulmonic valve with a valve from a human donor. This procedure has not been performed long enough to evaluate the long-term performance of the pulmonic valve when moved to the aortic position.''Mechanical prostheses have proven to be extremely durable and can be expected to last from 20 to 40 years. However, mechanical prosthetic valves all require life-long anticoagulation with blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') to prevent clot formation on the valve surfaces. Otherwise, blood clots dislodged from these valves can travel to the brain and cause embolic ''stroke'' or embolic problems in other parts of the body. The original caged-ball Starr-Edwards prosthesis of the 1960s was replaced by the tilting disc Bjork-Shiley of the 1970s and early 1980s. Although the Bjork-Shiley valve provided a larger opening for blood flow, a second generation model of the valve posed the risk of potential breakage resulting in death, and is no longer available in the United States. The tilting pivoting disc Hall-Medtronic valve and the two leaflet (bileaflet) carbon St. Jude valve are commonly used mechanical prostheses today. These valves provide excellent flow characteristics but require life-long anticoagulation with blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), to prevent embolic complications.''The aortic valve area can be opened or enlarged with a balloon catheter (''balloon valvuloplasty'') which is introduced in much the same way as in cardiac catheterization. With balloon valvuloplasty, the aortic valve area typically increases slightly. Patients with critical aortic stenosis can therefore experience temporary improvement with this procedure. Unfortunately, most of these valves narrow over a 6 to 18 month period. Therefore, balloon valvuloplasty is useful as a short-term measure to temporarily relieve symptoms in patients who are not candidates for aortic valve replacement.''Patients who require urgent noncardiac surgery, such as a ''hip replacement'', may benefit from aortic valvuloplasty prior to surgery. Valvuloplasty improves ''heart function'' and the chances of surviving non-cardiac surgery. Aortic valvuloplasty can also be useful as a ''bridge'' to aortic valve replacement in the elderly patient with poorly functioning ventricular muscle. Balloon valvuloplasty may temporarily improve ventricular muscle function, and thus improve surgical survival. Those who respond to valvuloplasty with improvement in ventricular function can be expected to benefit even more from aortic valve replacement. Aortic valvuloplasty in these high risk elderly patients has a similar mortality (5%) and serious complication rate (5%) as aortic valve replacement in surgical candidates.''There is a new alternative available to high risk surgical patients, referred to as transcutaneous aortic valve insertion (TAVI). In this procedure, a prosthetic aortic valve is inserted through the artery in the groin or via direct insertion into the heart, but without the need for ''open heart surgery''. While the preliminary data is encouraging, it has only recently been released from investigational status, and its ultimate role in management is still being evaluated.'  "

Blood flows from the right and left atria across the tricuspid and mitral valves into the lower chambers (right and left ventricles). The right and left ventricles have thick muscular walls for pumping blood across the pulmonic and aortic valves into the circulation. Heart valves are thin leaflets of tissue which open and close at the proper time during each heart beat cycle. The main function of these heart valves is to prevent blood from flowing backwards. Blood circulates through the arteries to provide oxygen and other nutrients to the body, and then returns with carbon dioxide waste through the veins to the right atrium; when the ventricles relax, blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. When the ventricles contract, blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonic valve into the lungs to reload on oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium and passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. Blood is pumped by the left ventricle across the aortic valve into the aorta and the arteries of the body."
What are the symptoms of aortic stenosis?,"'The major symptoms of aortic stenosis are:''In a low percentage of the patients with aortic stenosis, the first symptom is sudden death, usually during strenuous exertion.''The exact reason for sudden death is unknown. It may be due to heart rhythm abnormalities secondary to inadequate blood flow through the narrowed aortic valve into the coronary arteries of the heart. Insufficient oxygen to the inner lining of the heart muscle occurs do to the lack of blood flow to the coronary arteries, particularly during strenuous ''exercise''. Lack of oxygen in the heart muscles causes chest ''pain'' and possibly ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Chest ''pain'' is the first symptom in one-third of patients and eventually occurs in one-half of patients with aortic stenosis. Chest pain in patients with aortic stenosis is the same as chest pain (angina) experienced by patients with ''coronary artery disease''. In both of these conditions, pain is described as pressure below the breast bone brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. In patients with ''coronary artery disease'', chest pain is due to inadequate blood supply to the heart muscles because of narrowed coronary arteries. In patients with aortic stenosis, chest pain often occurs without any underlying narrowing of the coronary arteries. The thickened heart muscle must pump against high pressure to push blood through the narrowed aortic valve. This increases heart muscle oxygen demand in excess of the supply delivered in the blood, causing chest pain (angina).'""Fainting (syncope) related to aortic stenosis is usually associated with exertion or excitement. These conditions cause relaxation of the body's blood vessels (vasodilation), ""'lowering blood pressure''. In aortic stenosis, the heart is unable to increase output to compensate for the drop in ''blood pressure''. Therefore, blood flow to the brain is decreased, causing fainting. Fainting can also occur when cardiac output is decreased by an irregular heart beat (''arrhythmia''). Without effective treatment, the average life expectancy is less than 3 years after the onset of chest pain or syncope symptoms.'""Shortness of breath from heart failure is the most ominous sign. It reflects the heart muscle's failure to compensate for the extreme pressure load of aortic stenosis. Shortness of breath is caused by increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lung due to the increased pressure required to fill the left ventricle. Initially, shortness of breath occurs only during activity. As the disease progresses, shortness of breath occurs at rest. Patients can find it difficult to lie flat without becoming short of breath (orthopnea). Without treatment, the average life expectancy after the onset of heart failure due to aortic stenosis is between 6 to 24 months.""   chest pain (angina), fainting (syncope), and shortness of breath (due to heart failure)."
What causes aortic stenosis?,"'In adults, three conditions are known to cause aortic stenosis.''Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients under age 65. Normal aortic valves have three thin leaflets called cusps. About 2% of people are born with aortic valves that have only two cusps (bicuspid valves). Although bicuspid valves usually do not impede blood flow when the patients are young, they do not open as widely as normal valves with three cusps. Therefore, blood flow across the bicuspid valves is more turbulent, causing increased wear and tear on the valve leaflets. Over time, excessive wear and tear leads to calcification, scarring, and reduced mobility of the valve leaflets. About 10% of bicuspid valves become significantly narrowed, resulting in the symptoms and heart problems of aortic stenosis.''The most common cause of aortic stenosis in patients 65 years of age and over is called ""senile calcific aortic stenosis."" With ''aging'', protein collagen of the valve leaflets is destroyed, and calcium is deposited on the leaflets. Turbulence across the valve increases causing scarring, thickening, and stenosis of the valve once valve leaflet mobility is reduced by calcification. Why this ''aging'' process progresses to cause significant aortic stenosis in some patients but not in others is unknown. The progressive disease causing aortic calcification and stenosis has nothing to with healthy lifestyle choices, unlike the calcium that can deposit in the coronary artery to cause ''heart attack''.''Rheumatic ''fever'' is a condition resulting from untreated infection by group A streptococcal bacteria. Damage to valve leaflets from rheumatic ''fever'' causes increased turbulence across the valve and more damage. The narrowing from rheumatic fever occurs from the fusion (melting together) of the edges (commissures) of the valve leaflets. Rheumatic aortic stenosis usually occurs with some degree of aortic regurgitation. Under normal circumstances, the aortic valve closes to prevent blood in the aorta from flowing back into the left ventricle. In aortic regurgitation, the diseased valve allows leakage of blood back into the left ventricle as the ventricular muscles relax after pumping. These patients also have some degree of rheumatic damage to the mitral valve. Rheumatic ''heart disease'' is a relatively uncommon occurrence in the United States, except in people who have immigrated from underdeveloped countries.'   Progressive wear and tear of a bicuspid valve present since birth (congenital). Wear and tear of the aortic valve in the elderly. Scarring of the aortic valve due to rheumatic fever as a child or young adult."
How does aortic stenosis affect the left ventricle pump?,"'Symptoms and heart problems in aortic stenosis are related to the degree of narrowing of the aortic valve area. Patients with mild aortic valve narrowing may experience no symptoms. When the narrowing becomes significant (usually greater that 50% reduction in valve area), the pressure in the left ventricle increases and a pressure difference can be measured between the left ventricle and the aorta. An easy way to conceptualize the size issues is to think of a normal aortic valve as being about a ""half-dollar"" size in diameter, and a significantly narrowed valve to be less than a ""dime"" in size. To compensate for the increasing resistance at the aortic valve, the muscles of the left ventricle thicken to maintain pump function and cardiac output. This muscle thickening causes a stiffer heart muscle which requires higher pressures in the left atrium and the blood vessels of the lungs to fill the left ventricle. Even though these patients may be able to maintain adequate and normal cardiac output at rest, the ability of the heart to increase output with ''exercise'' is limited by these high pressures. As the disease progresses the increasing pressure eventually causes the left ventricle to dilate, leading to a decrease in cardiac output and heart failure.'  "
How is aortic stenosis diagnosed?,"'The carotid arteries carry blood from the aorta to the brain and are the closest arteries to the aortic valve that can be felt by the doctor examining the neck. Patients with significant aortic stenosis have a delayed upstroke and lower intensity of the carotid pulse which correlates with the severity of narrowing. Aortic valve stenosis causes significant turbulence to blood flowing during contraction of the left ventricle resulting in a loud murmur. The loudness of the murmur does not, however, correlate with the severity of stenosis. Patients with mild stenosis can have loud murmurs, while patients with severe stenosis and heart failure may not pump enough blood to cause much of a murmur.''Electrocardiogram'' (''EKG''): '""An EKG is a recording of the heart's electrical activity. Abnormal patterns on the EKG can reflect a thickened heart muscle and suggest the diagnosis of aortic stenosis. In rare instances, electrical conduction abnormality can also been seen.""'Chest X-ray'': ''A chest X-ray'' ''usually shows a normal heart shadow. The aorta above the aortic valve is often enlarged (dilated). If heart failure is present, fluid in the lung tissue and larger blood vessels in the upper lung regions are often seen. A careful inspection of the chest X-ray sometimes reveals calcification of the aortic valve.''Echocardiography'':'' Echocardiography uses ''ultrasound'' waves to obtain images of the heart chambers, valves, and surrounding structures. It is a useful non-invasive tool, which helps doctors diagnose aortic valve disease. An echocardiogram can show a thickened, calcified aortic valve which opens poorly. It can also show the size and functioning of the heart chambers. A technique called Doppler can be used to determine the pressure difference on either side of the aortic valve and to estimate the aortic valve area.''Cardiac catheterization: ''Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard in evaluating aortic stenosis. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the aortic valve and into the left ventricle. Simultaneous pressures are measured on both sides of the aortic valve. The rate of blood flow across the aortic valve can also be measured using a special catheter. Using these data, the aortic valve area can be calculated. A normal aortic valve area is 3 square centimeters. Symptoms usually occur when the aortic valve area narrows to less than 1 square centimeter. Critical aortic stenosis is present when the valve area is less than 0.7 square centimeters. In patients over 40 years of age, X-ray contrast agents can be injected into the coronary arteries (''coronary angiography'') during cardiac catheterization to evaluate the status of coronary arteries. If significant narrowing of the coronary arteries is found, ''coronary artery bypass graft'' surgery (''CABG'') can be performed during aortic valve replacement surgery.' "
What is the treatment for aortic stenosis?,"'Patients without symptoms can be observed until symptoms develop. Patients with mild aortic stenosis do not require treatment or restriction of activity. Patients with moderate aortic stenosis (valve area 1.5 to 1.0 square centimeters) are advised to avoid strenuous activities such as ''weight lifting'' or sprinting. Aortic stenosis can progress over a few years. Therefore, patients are usually examined annually and evaluated by echocardiography periodically to monitor disease progression. Since valve infection (''endocarditis'') is a serious complication of aortic stenosis, these patients are usually given antibiotics prior to any procedure in which bacteria may be introduced into the bloodstream. This includes routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that may traumatize body tissues such as ''colonoscopy'' and gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') and ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''PCE''), as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'' (Unasyn), gentamicin (''Garamycin''), and ''vancomycin'' (Lyphocin, ''Vancocin'').''When symptoms of chest pain, syncope, or shortness of breath appear, the prognosis for patients with aortic stenosis without valve replacement surgery is poor. Medical therapy, such as the use of diuretics to reduce high lung pressures and remove lung fluid can provide only temporary relief of symptoms. Patients with symptoms usually undergo cardiac catheterization. If severe aortic stenosis is confirmed, aortic valve replacement is usually recommended. The overall mortality risk for aortic valve replacement surgery is about 5%. Advanced age should not be a reason for not recommending aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Otherwise healthy patients in their 80s with strong heart muscles often benefit dramatically from aortic valve replacement for critical aortic stenosis.''Replacement aortic valves processed from pigs (porcine) or cows (bovine) are called bioprostheses. Bioprostheses are less durable than mechanical prostheses (discussed below) but have the advantage of not needing life-long blood thinning (anticoagulation) medication to prevent ''blood clots'' from forming on the valve surfaces. The average life expectancy of an aortic valve bioprostheses is 10 to 15 years. Bioprostheses rapidly calcify, degenerate and narrow in young patients. Therefore, bioprostheses are primarily used on older patients or in patients who cannot take blood thinners. Recently, aortic valves from human cadavers have been used in younger patients to avoid the need for anticoagulation medication. However, the availability of human aortic grafts is limited; though probably better than the other bioprostheses, its long term durability is unknown. The new ""Ross Procedure"" consists of moving the pulmonic valve to the aortic position and replacing the pulmonic valve with a valve from a human donor. This procedure has not been performed long enough to evaluate the long-term performance of the pulmonic valve when moved to the aortic position.''Mechanical prostheses have proven to be extremely durable and can be expected to last from 20 to 40 years. However, mechanical prosthetic valves all require life-long anticoagulation with blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') to prevent clot formation on the valve surfaces. Otherwise, blood clots dislodged from these valves can travel to the brain and cause embolic ''stroke'' or embolic problems in other parts of the body. The original caged-ball Starr-Edwards prosthesis of the 1960s was replaced by the tilting disc Bjork-Shiley of the 1970s and early 1980s. Although the Bjork-Shiley valve provided a larger opening for blood flow, a second generation model of the valve posed the risk of potential breakage resulting in death, and is no longer available in the United States. The tilting pivoting disc Hall-Medtronic valve and the two leaflet (bileaflet) carbon St. Jude valve are commonly used mechanical prostheses today. These valves provide excellent flow characteristics but require life-long anticoagulation with blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), to prevent embolic complications.''The aortic valve area can be opened or enlarged with a balloon catheter (''balloon valvuloplasty'') which is introduced in much the same way as in cardiac catheterization. With balloon valvuloplasty, the aortic valve area typically increases slightly. Patients with critical aortic stenosis can therefore experience temporary improvement with this procedure. Unfortunately, most of these valves narrow over a 6 to 18 month period. Therefore, balloon valvuloplasty is useful as a short-term measure to temporarily relieve symptoms in patients who are not candidates for aortic valve replacement.''Patients who require urgent noncardiac surgery, such as a ''hip replacement'', may benefit from aortic valvuloplasty prior to surgery. Valvuloplasty improves ''heart function'' and the chances of surviving non-cardiac surgery. Aortic valvuloplasty can also be useful as a ''bridge'' to aortic valve replacement in the elderly patient with poorly functioning ventricular muscle. Balloon valvuloplasty may temporarily improve ventricular muscle function, and thus improve surgical survival. Those who respond to valvuloplasty with improvement in ventricular function can be expected to benefit even more from aortic valve replacement. Aortic valvuloplasty in these high risk elderly patients has a similar mortality (5%) and serious complication rate (5%) as aortic valve replacement in surgical candidates.''There is a new alternative available to high risk surgical patients, referred to as transcutaneous aortic valve insertion (TAVI). In this procedure, a prosthetic aortic valve is inserted through the artery in the groin or via direct insertion into the heart, but without the need for ''open heart surgery''. While the preliminary data is encouraging, it has only recently been released from investigational status, and its ultimate role in management is still being evaluated.'  "
What is the Apgar score?,"'Most term infants make a successful and uneventful transition from living within the womb to the outside world. Some will need some medical intervention, and very few will require extensive resuscitation. A reproducible and rapidly determined rating system is necessary for evaluation of the condition of the ''newborn'' infant. The Apgar score is a practical method for assessing a neonate.' "
How is the Apgar score done?,"'The Apgar score is a number calculated by scoring the ''heart'' rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, skin color, and reflex irritability (response to a catheter in the nostril). Each of these objective signs can receive 0, 1, or 2 points.' "
What does a high or low Apgar score mean?,'A perfect Apgar score of 10 means an infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with an Apgar score of 0-3 needs immediate resuscitation. It is important to note that diligent care of the newborn is an immediate response to the current status of the infant. It is inappropriate to wait until Apgar scores are obtained to begin or continue to address the needs of the neonate.' 
When is the Apgar scoring done?,"'The Apgar score is done routinely 60 seconds after the birth of the infant and then is repeated five minutes after birth.''In the event of a difficult resuscitation, the Apgar score may be done again at 10, 15, and 20 minutes.' "
What does a persistently low Apgar score mean?,"'The persistence of low (0-3) Apgar scores at 20 minutes of age is predictive of high rates of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). In term infants, the five-minute Apgar score is predictive of mortality but is not as precise a predictor for neurologic and developmental disabilities. In high-risk (prematurity, low birth weight, etc.) infants, Apgar scores are less sensitive regarding long- term predictions of mental and neurological health.' "
Why was the Apgar score developed?,"'The score is named for the preeminent American anesthesiologist Dr. Virginia Apgar (1909-1974), who invented the scoring method in 1952. Having assisted at thousands of deliveries, Dr. Apgar wished to focus attention on the baby. ''Babies'"" were traditionally dispatched directly to the nursery, often without much formal scrutiny after delivery. Apgar wanted the baby to be assessed in an organized, meaningful manner by the delivery-room personnel. Dr. Apgar was the first woman to be appointed a full professor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons."" "
What is aphasia?,"'Aphasia is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the portions of the brain that are responsible for language. Primary signs of the disorder include difficulty in expressing oneself when speaking, trouble understanding speech, and difficulty with reading and writing. Aphasia is not a disease, but a symptom of brain damage.' "
Who has aphasia?,"'Most commonly seen in adults who have suffered a ''stroke'', aphasia can also result from a ''brain tumor'', infection, ''head injury'', or ''dementia'' that damages the brain. It is estimated that about 1 million people in the United States today suffer from aphasia. The type and severity of language dysfunction depends on the precise location and extent of the damaged brain tissue. '  "
What are the types of aphasia?,"'Generally, aphasia can be divided into four broad categories: (1) Expressive aphasia involves difficulty in conveying thoughts through speech or writing. The patient knows what he wants to say, but cannot find the words he needs. (2) Receptive aphasia involves difficulty understanding spoken or written language. The patient hears the voice or sees the print but cannot make sense of the words. (3) Patients with anomic or ''amnesia'' aphasia, the least severe form of aphasia, have difficulty in using the correct names for particular objects, people, places, or events. (4) Global aphasia results from severe and extensive damage to the language areas of the brain. Patients lose almost all language function, both comprehension and expression. They cannot speak or understand speech, nor can they read or write.'  "
What is the treatment for aphasia?,"'In some instances, an individual will completely recover from aphasia without treatment. In most cases, however, language therapy should begin as soon as possible and be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. Rehabilitation with a speech pathologist involves extensive exercises in which patients read, write, follow directions, and repeat what they hear. Computer-aided therapy may supplement standard language therapy.' "
What is the prognosis for aphasia?,"'The outcome of aphasia is difficult to predict given the wide range of variability of the condition. Generally, people who are younger or have less extensive brain damage fare better. The location of the injury is also important and is another clue to prognosis. In general, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.' "
What research is being done for aphasia?,"'The NINDS and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders conduct and support a broad range of scientific investigations to increase our understanding of aphasia, find better treatments, and discover improved methods to restore lost function to people who have aphasia.' "
What is sleep apnea?,"""Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by a reduction or pause of breathing (airflow) during sleep. It is common among adults, becoming more common in children. Although a diagnosis of sleep apnea often will be suspected on the basis of a person's medical history, there are several tests that can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of sleep apnea can be either surgical or nonsurgical.""'An apnea is a period of time during which breathing stops or is markedly reduced. In simplified terms, an apnea occurs when a person stops breathing for 10 seconds or more. If a person stops breathing completely or take less than 10% of a normal breath for a period that lasts 10 seconds or more, this is an apnea. This definition includes complete stoppage of airflow. Other definitions of apnea that may be used include at least a 4% drop in oxygen in the blood, a direct result of the reduction in the transfer of oxygen into the blood when breathing stops.''Apneas usually occur during sleep. When an apnea occurs, sleep usually is disrupted due to inadequate breathing and poor oxygen levels in the blood. Sometimes this means the person wakes up completely, but sometimes this can mean the person comes out of a deep level of sleep and into a more shallow level of sleep. Apneas are usually measured during sleep (preferably in all stages of sleep) over a 2-hour period. An estimate of the severity of apnea is calculated by dividing the number of apneas by the number of hours of sleep, giving an apnea index (AI in apneas per hour); the greater the AI, the more severe the apnea.''A hypopnea is a decrease in breathing that is not as severe as an apnea. Hypopneas usually occur during sleep and can be defined as greater than 30% of a normal breath. Like apneas, hypopneas also may be defined as a 3-4% or greater drop in oxygen in the blood. Like apneas, hypopneas usually disrupt the level of sleep. A hypopnea index (HI) can be calculated by dividing the number of hypopneas by the number of hours of sleep.''The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is an index of severity that combines apneas and hypopneas. Combining them gives an overall severity of sleep apnea including sleep disruptions and desaturations (a low level of oxygen in the blood). The apnea-hypopnea index, like the apnea index and hypopnea index, is calculated by dividing the number of apneas and hypopneas by the number of hours of sleep.''Another index that is used to measure sleep apnea is the respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The respiratory disturbance index is similar to the apnea-hypopnea index; however, it also includes respiratory events that do not technically meet the definitions of apneas or hypopneas, but do disrupt sleep.''Sleep apnea is formally defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of at least 15 episodes/hour in a patient if he or she does not have medical problems that are believed to be caused by the sleep apnea. This is the equivalent of approximately one episode of apnea or hypopnea every 4 minutes.''High blood pressure'', ''stroke'', daytime sleepiness, ''congestive heart failure'' (low flow of blood to the ''heart''), ''insomnia'', and mood disorders can be caused or worsened by sleep apnea. In the presence of these conditions, sleep apnea is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index of at least five episodes/hour. This definition is stricter because these individuals may be already experiencing the negative medical effects of sleep apnea, and it may be important to begin treatment at a lower apnea-hypopnea index.'  "
What are the types of sleep apnea?,"'There are three types of sleep apnea:''During sleep, the brain instructs the muscles of breathing to take a breath. ' central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and mixed sleep apnea (both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea).  Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to the muscles to take a breath and there is no muscular effort to take a breath. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the brain sends the signal to the muscles and the muscles make an effort to take a breath, but they are unsuccessful because the airway becomes obstructed and prevents an adequate flow of air. Mixed sleep apnea, occurs when there is both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. "
What is central sleep apnea and what causes it?,"'Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to breathe to the muscles of breathing. This usually occurs in infants or in adults with ''heart disease'', cerebrovascular disease, or congenital diseases, but it also can be caused by some medications and high altitudes.'""Central sleep apnea may occur in premature infants (born before 37 weeks of gestation) or in full-term infants. It is defined as apneas lasting more than 20 seconds, usually with a change in the heart rate, a reduction in blood oxygen, or hypotonia (general relaxation of the body's muscles). These children often will require an apnea monitor that sounds an alarm when apneas occur. Central sleep apnea in children is not the same thing as ""'sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS'').''Under normal circumstances, the brain monitors several things to determine how often to breathe. If it senses a lack of oxygen or an excess of carbon dioxide in the blood it will speed up breathing. The increase in breathing increases the oxygen and decreases the carbon dioxide in blood. Some people with heart or lung disease have an increase in carbon dioxide in their blood at all times.''When there is a chronic (long-term) increase in blood carbon dioxide, the brain starts to ignore the oxygen level and monitors the blood carbon dioxide level to determine when to take the next breath. The control of breathing also becomes slower to respond to changes in carbon dioxide levels; so when a person takes more or deeper breaths and ""blows off"" carbon dioxide the drive to breathe decreases and the rate of breathing decreases. As a result of slower rate of breathing, carbon dioxide builds back up in the blood and the rate of breathing increases again. The brain, slow to adjust, continues to signal for more rapid breathing until the carbon dioxide level drops too low. Breathing then slows down or stops until the carbon dioxide level rises again. This pattern of abnormal breathing is called Cheyne-Stokes breathing (after the men who described it). It is characterized by repetitive cycles of fast breathing followed by slow breathing and apnea. The full cycle is roughly around 90 seconds. This breathing pattern happens when the person is awake or asleep, but becomes more of a problem when asleep. Some patients with ''heart failure'' have central sleep apnea associated with a Cheyne-Stokes pattern of breathing.''Central sleep apnea usually occurs in adults with other medical problems. In infants, it usually occurs with prematurity or other congenital disorders. In both patient groups it is usually suspected by the primary care doctor. Central sleep apnea can be diagnosed with a sleep study or overnight monitoring while the patient is in the hospital.''In infants, central sleep apnea is treated with an apnea alarm. This alarm monitors the infant\'s breathing with sensors and sounds a loud noise when the infant experiences an apnea. The alarm usually wakes the infant and the parents. Most infants usually ""out-grow"" the central apnea episodes, so the alarm monitoring is stopped after the episodes resolve. In infants with other congenital problems, apnea monitoring may be needed for a longer period.''In adults with central sleep apnea, the apneas are treated by treating the underlying ''heart disease'', medication interaction, high altitude, or other primary problem.' "
What is obstructive sleep apnea and what causes it?,"'In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), apneas have four components.''First, it is necessary to describe a ""normal breath."" A normal breath of air passes through the nasal passages, behind the soft palate and uvula (part of the soft palate), then past the tongue base, through the throat muscles, and between the vocal cords into the ''lungs''. An obstruction to the flow of air at any of these levels may lead to apnea. The following are some examples:''To break it down even further:''People with obstructive sleep apnea have an airway that is more narrow than normal, usually at the base of the tongue and palate. When lying flat, the palate is above the air passage. When the pharyngeal muscles (muscles of the pharynx or throat ) relax the palate can fall backwards and this can obstruct the airway.''The genioglossus muscle is located where the base of the tongue attaches to the jawbone in front. Most people have enough space behind the tongue to take a breath without needing to pull the tongue forward. However, when obstructive sleep apnea patients are awake, this muscle needs to be active to pull the base of the tongue forward to open the airway. During sleep, most muscles including the genioglossus relax. During the stage of rapid eye movement (REM), the muscles completely relax. Relaxation of the genioglossus muscle during sleep allows the base of the tongue to fall backwards and the airway closes.'""Patients with obstructive sleep apnea often don't report waking up during the night with each episode of apnea. Frequently, during the apnea the brain only awakens from a deep sleep (stages N3 [non-rapid eye movement Stage 3], or REM) to a shallow level of sleep. The genioglossus muscle then contracts and pulls the tongue forward so that a breath can be taken. The patient may remain asleep, but the deep sleep that is important to be fully rested the following day is disrupted."" First, the airway collapses or becomes obstructed. Second, an effort is made to take a breath, but it is unsuccessful. Third, the oxygen level in the blood drops as a result of unsuccessful breathing. Finally, when the amount of oxygen reaching the brain decreases, the brain signals the body to wake up and take a breath. (This is what the bed partner hears as a silence followed by a gasp for air.) airflow can become diminished if a person has a deviated septum (the middle wall of the nose that separates the two nostrils). A septum can be deviated to one or both sides narrowing the air passages; there are filters in the nose called turbinates that can obstruct airflow when they become swollen; if the palate and uvula (the part of soft palate that hangs down in the back of the throat) are long or floppy, they can fall backwards and close the area through which air flows; the back of the tongue can also fall backwards and obstruct breathing especially when individuals lay flat on their backs; or the side walls of the throat can fall together to narrow or close the airway. the muscles of breathing work to expand the chest and lower the diaphragm to degenerate a negative pressure between the airways of the lungs and outside; this negative pressure literally sucks air into the lungs; the nasal passages, palate, tongue, and pharyngeal tissues can all contribute to narrowing of the airway; if during an attempt to breathe the airway collapses or is obstructed the tissues of the airway are sucked together by the negative pressure; the harder the chest tries to pull air in the greater the negative pressure and the more the tissues of the airway are sealed together; and finally, when the oxygen in the blood stream decreases the person wakes up or the level of sleep becomes more shallow in order to more consciously take a breath."
How common is obstructive sleep apnea?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is estimated to affect about 24% to 31% of men and 9% to 21% of women. In one study of people over 18 years of age, obstructive sleep apnea was estimated to develop in 1.5% of people per year over the 5 year study. It is probably more common than either of these numbers because the population is becoming more ''obese'', and ''obesity'' worsens obstructive sleep apnea. More shocking is the estimate that only 10% of people with obstructive sleep apnea are currently receiving treatment and many patients with sleep apnea remain undiagnosed.''Some groups are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea.' Men are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea than women before age 50. After age 50, the risk is the same in men and women. Among obese patients, a majority have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea worsens in severity and prevalence with increasing obesity. Among patients with heart disease, a significant portion have obstructive sleep apnea, and among patients with strokes, a majority have obstructive sleep apnea. African-Americans over the age of 65 have a 2.5 times greater risk of obstructive sleep apnea than Caucasians. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in the Chinese population is similar to American Caucasians, but the Chinese population is generally smaller and less obese than the general American population. Therefore, something besides obesity must be the explanation for obstructive sleep apnea in the Chinese population. We do not understand the reasons for these differences, but studies are ongoing to better define the risks. The prevalence of sleep apnea in nonobese and otherwise healthy children younger than 8 years old is considered as high as 1% to 10%. Obstructive sleep apnea may develop in children of all ages, even in infants. Prematurely born infants are at a higher risk to develop sleep apnea."
What are obstructive sleep apnea symptoms?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea has many well-studied consequences. First, as one would expect, it disrupts sleep. Patients with disrupted sleep cannot concentrate, think, or remember as well during the day. This has been shown to cause more accidents in the work place and while driving. Thus, people with obstructive sleep apnea have a three-fold greater risk of a car accident than the general population. ''Sleep apnea symptoms at night time include: ''Sleep apnea also can cause significant and sometimes serious daytime symptoms as a result of insufficient sleep at night, including: ''It is important to note that the bed partner of individuals with sleep apnea may also suffer from poor nighttime sleep and can have some of the same symptoms.  '   Snoring, usually loud and bothersome to others Gasping for air, witnessed apneas, or choking sensation Insomnia Restless sleep daytime sleepiness nonrestorative sleep (feeling as tired in the morning as before going to bed) fatigue frequent day time naps headaches irritability  poor memory and attention confusion  mood and personality changes, such as depression and anxiety sexual dysfunction"
What are some of the complications of sleep apnea?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be a risk factor for the development of other medical conditions. ''High blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, ''atherosclerotic'' heart disease, ''pulmonary hypertension'', ''insulin resistance'', and even death are some of the known complications of untreated obstructive sleep apnea. Cognitive impairment (memory problems), ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') are also among possible complications of untreated sleep apnea.''Sleep apnea can cause or worsen ''high blood pressure'' and heart problems. Cessation of breathing frequently during the night (every 1 to 4 minutes) can cause increased ''stress'' on the heart. As the oxygen saturation in the blood decreases and the apnea continues, the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the ""fight or flight"" response of the body) is activated. This fight or flight response sends nerve signals to the blood vessels to constrict (tighten up) and to the heart to work harder. When the vessels constrict, more blood is sent to the brain and muscles. However, as a result this increases the ''blood pressure'', which requires the heart to work harder to pump blood through the smaller caliber vessels. That, combined with the signal for the heart to work harder and the lower available oxygen in the blood from apnea, causes increased ''stress'' on the heart throughout the night. Sleep is normally the time when the heart has less work to do and can ""rest.""''Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea that do not have high blood pressure, 45% will develop high blood pressure within 4 years. If one examines patients who have hard-to-control blood pressure, that is, taking more than one medicine for control, up to 80% can potentially have obstructive sleep apnea. When the obstructive sleep apnea is treated, blood pressure decreases.''The risk for congestive heart failure increases by 140% and the risk of ''stroke'' by 60% times with obstructive sleep apnea.''Obstructive sleep apnea can complicate the treatment of ''atrial fibrillation''. ''Atrial fibrillation'' is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the upper part of the heart (''atrium'') is beating out of coordination with the lower part (ventricle). The treatment is to cardiovert the heart (resetting the ''atrium'' and allowing it to synchronize with the ventricle). After ''cardioversion'', 50% of patients have a recurrence of ''atrial fibrillation'', but patients with obstructive sleep apnea have an 80% recurrence.' "
How is obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed and evaluated?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea can be diagnosed and evaluated by subjective (perceived or biased) and objective (factual, based on empirical data) methods. An example of a subjective method that measures the effects of obstructive sleep apnea on patients is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.''The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-report test that establishes the severity of sleepiness. A person rates the likelihood of falling asleep during specific activities. Using the scale from 0 to 3 below, the risk of dozing can be ranked from the chart below.''0 = Unlikely to fall asleep''1 = Slight risk of falling asleep''2 = Moderate risk of falling asleep''3 = High likelihood of falling asleep''After ranking each category, the total score is calculated. The range is 0 to 24, with higher scores suggesting greater sleepiness.''Breaking it down further, excessive daytime sleepiness is greater than 10. It is important to note that in patients with insufficient sleep (less than 7-7.5 hours for most adults), they can also have daytime somnolence even without obstructive sleep apnea.''Primary snorers usually have a score less than 10, and individuals with moderate to severe sleep apnea usually have a score greater than 16. Self-reported, subjective measures such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale usually are combined with a thorough medical history. The history includes questions about:''Next a physical examination is performed to examine the areas of possible airway collapse.''The primary objective test for obstructive sleep apnea is polysomnography, also referred to as a sleep study. This test measures different physical and physiological parameters while a subject is asleep. During attended polysomnography, a technician observes a person sleeping and monitors recording equipment in the setting of a sleep laboratory. A typical polysomnography test includes:''The ''EEG (electroencephalogram) ''monitors brain waves and can be used to determine the level of sleep or wakefulness. It is helpful for determining if an event (respiratory or limb movement) disrupts the level of sleep.''An ''EOG (electro-oculogram)'' measures eye movements using sticker electrodes placed next to each eye. During ''REM sleep'' (dreaming sleep), the eyes typically move from side-to-side. This measurement can help determine the duration of REM sleep.''An ''EMG (electromyogram) ''measures muscle movements. Frequently, an additional monitor is placed on the chin to measure muscle relaxation (tone). During stage 1-4 sleep there is a baseline muscle tone; however, during REM sleep all muscles relax. The EMG also helps to determine the duration of REM sleep. An EMG of the legs can be used to detect ""''restless legs syndrome''"" or periodic leg movements during sleep.''Oral and nasal airflow'' can be measured by several different methods to help determine the size and frequency of breaths during sleep. Chest and abdominal movements occur with each attempt to breathe and can be used to distinguish between central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. (During central sleep apnea, the signal to take a breath is not given, so the muscles do not attempt to take a breath. During obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles attempt to take a breath, but no air moves.)''Measurement of the loudness of snoring'' can be used to quantify snoring. (Sometimes a measurement is needed to convince someone that they have a snoring problem.) It can also be used to measure changes after treatments for snoring.''Oximetry'' is used to measure the decreases in oxygen in the blood during apneas and hypopneas.''The video monitor'' is most helpful for detecting movement disorders, parasomnias, or ''seizures'' during sleep. (Often a patient will not remember ''sleepwalking'', sleep talking, or other parasomnias, so a video is helpful to review the events with the patient.)''After polysomnography is completed the data are analyzed by a board certified sleep specialist. The number of apneas, hypopneas, leg movements, and desaturations as well as sleep levels are all recorded in a formal report, and a diagnosis is made.''Although the primary objective test for obstructive sleep apnea is the sleep study (polysomnography); other tests for obstructive sleep apnea include the:''For someone who reports being ''sleepy during the day'', it is sometimes helpful to measure how sleepy they are. Also, after treatment of ''sleep problems'' the doctor may want to measure improvement in daytime sleepiness. Sleepiness can be measured with a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).''Basically, the MSLT measures how fast someone falls asleep during the day. It must be done after an overnight sleep study (polysomnography), which documents adequate opportunity for sleep the night before. The test is composed of four to five naps that last 20 minutes and are spaced2 hours apart. The person is instructed to try and fall asleep. The average time to fall asleep is calculated for all four or five tests. Normal time would be greater than 10 minutes to fall asleep. ''Excessive sleepiness'' is less than 5 minutes to fall asleep.''The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) also measures daytime sleepiness. The person in this test is instructed to try to stay awake. This is repeated for four 40-minute sessions 2 hours apart. Not falling asleep in all four tests is the strongest objective measure of no daytime sleepiness.''Some agencies use these tests to ensure that their employees are not excessively sleepy while at work. Specifically, airline pilots and truck drivers who have sleepiness need to be tested. This is done for public safety and work productivity. Unfortunately, there is no test that will guarantee that someone will not fall asleep at his or her job or while driving.''Obstructive sleep apnea can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. This stratification assists in determining the direction of treatment. For example, some treatments that are excellent for mild sleep apnea nearly always will fail for severe sleep apnea.''The severity level is measured with polysomnography. In one grading scale using the apnea-hypopnea index, mild obstructive sleep apnea is 5 to 15 events per hour, moderate obstructive sleep apnea is 15 to 30 events per hour, and severe obstructive sleep apnea is more than 30 events per hour.' 0 to 9 = Average daytime sleepiness 10 to 15 = Excessive daytime sleepiness 16 to 24 = Moderate to severe daytime sleepiness work performance, daytime sleepiness, driving and accident history, napping, falling asleep during meetings, and decreased memory. In the nose, this includes the septum, turbinates, nasal polyps, adenoid hypertrophy, and nasopharynx (back of the nose). In the mouth, the palate, tonsils, uvula, pharyngeal walls, and neck circumference are all examined. A flexible nasopharyngoscopy is usually performed to examine the airway during active breathing and simulated snoring maneuvers. (The nasopharyngoscope is a fiber-optic, flexible tube approximately 18 inches in length and an eighth of an inch in diameter with a camera on its end. The camera end is inserted through the nasal passage to the upper throat or pharynx where the actions of the tongue and palate can be observed.) an electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors brain waves, an electro-oculogram (EOG) monitors eye movements, an electromyogram (EMG) monitors muscle activity, measurement of oral and nasal airflow, measurement of chest and abdominal movement, audio recording of the loudness of snoring, blood oxygen levels (oximetry), and video monitoring of the subject during the study. Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)"
What are the nonsurgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea?,"'The nonsurgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are similar to the non-surgical treatments for snoring with a few differences. Treatments include:''Behavioral changes are the simplest treatments for mild obstructive sleep apnea, but often the hardest to make. Occasionally, apneas occur only in some positions (most commonly lying flat on the back). A person can change his or her sleeping position, reduce apneas, and improve their sleep.''Obesity is a known contributing factor to obstructive sleep apnea. It is estimated that a 10% ''weight gain'' will worsen the apnea-hypopnea index, and a 10% ''weight loss'' will decrease the apnea-hypopnea index. Therefore, a healthy lifestyle and ''diet'' that encourages ''weight loss'' will improve obstructive sleep apnea.''Unfortunately, most people with obstructive sleep apnea are tired and do not have much energy for ''exercise''. This is a difficult behavioral spiral since the more tired a person is, the less they ''exercise'', the more weight they gain, the worse the obstructive sleep apnea becomes, and the more tired they become. Frequently, after obstructive sleep apnea is treated by other methods people are able to ''lose weight'' and the obstructive sleep apnea may improve.''Sleep hygiene and other behavioral modifications known to improve the overall quality of sleep are also recommended. Below are some common practices that can induce sleep and enhance its quality:''Many medications have been studied for obstructive sleep apnea; however, because obstructive sleep apnea is due to an anatomic airway narrowing it has been difficult to find a medication that helps. Additional studies are being conducted and may proivide and alternative in the future.''A dental appliance is similar to a mouthpiece and holds the jaw and tongue forward and the palate up, thus preventing closure of the airway. This small increase in airway size often is enough to control the apneas.''Dental appliances are an excellent treatment for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. It is reported to be effective for these groups. A dental appliance does not require surgery; it is small, portable, and does not require a machine. They may be considered for use in combination with other treatment as well, including CPAP and nasal or other upper airway surgery. There are some disadvantages to the dental appliance. It can cause or worsen temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') dysfunction. If the jaw is pulled too far forward, it can cause ''pain'' in the joint when eating. For this reason, it is best to have a dentist,\xa0''oral surgeon'', or ENT surgeon who specializes in sleep fit and adjust the appliance. A dental appliance requires natural ''teeth'' to fit properly, it must be worn every night, and the cost is variable, as is insurance coverage.''Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is probably the best, non-surgical treatment for any level of obstructive sleep apnea. In finding a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, the primary goal is to hold the airway open so it does not collapse during sleep. The dental appliances and surgeries (described later) focus on moving the tissues of the airway. CPAP uses air pressure to hold the tissues open during sleep.'""CPAP was first used in Australia by Dr. Colin Sullivan in 1981 for obstructive sleep apnea. It delivers the air through a nasal or face-mask under pressure. As a person breathes, the gentle pressure holds the nose, palate, and throat tissues open. It feels similar to holding one's head outside the window of a moving car. A person can feel the pressure, but can also breathe easily.""'The CPAP machine blows heated, humidified air through a short tube to a mask. The mask must be worn snugly to prevent the leakage of air. There are many different masks, including nasal pillows, nasal masks, and full-face masks. CPAP machines today are smaller than a toaster. It is portable and can be taken on trips.''Determining CPAP pressure:'' With CPAP it is important to use the lowest possible pressure that will keep the airway open during sleep. This pressure is determined by ""titration."" Titration frequently is performed with the help of polysomnography. It can be performed during the same night as the initial polysomnography or on a separate night. In the sleep laboratory an adjustable CPAP machine is used. A mask is fit to the person and he or she is allowed to fall back asleep. However, for many patients, the titration portion of treatment is increasingly done by an ""auto-titrating"" CPAP machine at home, APAP.''During baseline sleep the apneas and hypopneas occur, and the technician then slowly increases the CPAP pressure until the apneas and hypopneas stop or decrease to a normal level. A different pressure may be needed for different positions or levels of sleep. Typically, laying on the back and REM sleep promote the worst obstructive sleep apnea. The lowest pressure or range of pressures that controls obstructive sleep apnea in all positions and sleep levels is prescribed.''Effectiveness of CPAP:'' CPAP has been shown to be effective in improving subjective and objective measures of obstructive sleep apnea. This effectiveness, however, is only achieved if patients adhere to the therapy, and this has proven difficult for many patients. If CPAP is tolerated,''When adjusted properly and tolerated, it is nearly 100% effective in eliminating or reducing obstructive sleep apnea.''An important clinical outcome of CPAP use is in the area of ''prevention'' of the potential complications of obstructive sleep apnea. Studies have shown that the proper use of CPAP reduces hospitalization for cardiac and pulmonary causes in people with obstructive sleep apnea. More generally, treating obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP can reduce the risks of conditions related to obstructive sleep apnea, such as, ischemic heart disease, ''abnormal heart rhythms'', ''stroke'', ''hypertension'', and ''insulin'' dependence.''Problems with CPAP:'' The first 2 to 4 weeks is the crucial time to become a successful CPAP user. During this time, it is important to try to sleep as many hours a night as possible with the mask on. If the CPAP mask does not fit properly or the machine is not working it is important to have it fixed immediately. It is also helpful to remember all of the increased risks of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (decreased productivity, ''heart attacks'', strokes, car accidents, and sudden death) as an incentive to continue using CPAP.''People with severe obstructive sleep apnea may never get a normal night of sleep. They often put on the CPAP mask and think it is the best thing ever. They quickly get used to it because it allows them to sleep. They take it on vacations because without it they have no energy and are always sleepy.''However, CPAP is not always easy to use. People with only mild to moderate sleep apnea often have a harder time using CPAP. A majority of people with CPAP machines report that they use them, but only some of them actually use them more than 4 hours per night when the actual use time is measured. A large percentage of people who start using CPAP, stop using it.''It is not easy to sleep with a mask that is blowing air into the nose. Some people are claustrophobic and have difficulty getting used to any mask. If a patient has nasal congestion or a septal deviation; it is important to have these evaluated since they can be treated (as discussed later). Some people do not like the inconvenience of sleeping with the mask or traveling with the machine. Others do not like the image of having to sleep with a mask. The noise of the machine blowing air can also be bothersome to some people using the CPAP or their bed partners.''Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was designed for people who do not tolerate the higher pressures of CPAP. It is similar to CPAP in that a machine delivers a positive pressure to a mask during sleep. However, the BiPAP machine delivers a higher pressure during inspiration, and a lower pressure during expiration, which allows the person not to feel like they are breathing out against such a high pressure, which can be bothersome. It is most helpful for people who require a higher pressure to keep their airway open. BiPAP was designed to improve CPAP compliance; however it is difficult to measure an increase in compliance when compared to standard CPAP. BiPAP is often only approved by insurance companies after documentation that a patient cannot tolerate CPAP.''The auto-titrating CPAP machine is a ""smart"" CPAP machine that makes pressure adjustments throughout the night. As discussed above, different pressures are needed for different levels of sleep and positions. The goal of auto-titrating CPAP is to have the lowest possible pressure for each position or sleep level. At a given pressure, if a person starts to have an apnea or hypopnea, the machine adjusts the pressure higher until the episodes are controlled. If a person is in a sleep level or position that doesn\'t need a higher pressure, the pressure is reduced. The benefit is when a lower pressure is all that is required, the machine is not stuck at the highest pressure needed. The down side is, if the machine does not adjust, a person can be stuck at a lower pressure having episodes of sleep apnea.''With auto-titrating CPAP, the mean pressure throughout the night is lower and two-thirds of the night is spent below the set CPAP pressure. The machine also can adjust for the changes in pressure that are needed to overcome the effects of weight gain and ''alcohol'' or sedative use. It may also improve compliance; however, this has not been measured. The disadvantages of auto-titrating CPAP are that leaks may underestimate pressure or airflow. Each company has a different algorithm for adjusting the pressure and adjusting for leaks. It is unclear which company has the best algorithm, but studies are on-going.'   behavioral changes, dental appliances and mouthpieces, CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), and medications. reduce lighting and noise in the bedroom; avoid reading or watching TV in bed; avoid eating or exercising prior to sleep; use the bedroom only for sleeping; keep work-related activities outside of the bedroom; and try a period of physical and mental relaxation before going to bed. In people with nasal airway obstruction causing obstructive sleep apnea, nasal steroid sprays have been shown to be effective. In one study, the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) decreased from 20 to 11 with nasal sprays. Topical nasal decongestants such as oxymetazoline and neosynephrine, also can temporarily improve nasal swelling. The problem is that they cannot be used for more than 3 to 5 days without decreased effectiveness and withdrawal symptoms. People who have obstructive sleep apnea due to hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone production) is uncommon. However, some have improved with thyroid replacement therapy. People with normal thyroid function will not improve with this therapy. People who have obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity may improve with diet medications if they are effective in assisting with weight loss. Other medications have been studied, including medroxyprogesterone (Provera, Cycrin, Amen), acetazolamide (Diamox), theophylline (Theo-Dur, Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theolair, Uniphyl, Slo-Phyllin), tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In these studies, they were shown to have little or no effect. There are also new medications to help increase alertness. They may be temporarily successful in increasing attention; however, they do not treat the sleep deprivation or the cause of obstructive sleep apnea. In cases where sleep apnea may be caused by another underlying condition, appropriate treatment of such conditions is recommended and may be beneficial. For example, treating underlying heart failure may improve sleep apnea if it is a contributing factor. In people with sinusitis and nasal congestion, the swelling and inflammation of the upper airway passages can cause snoring and sleep apnea. Therefore, medications to treat underlying sinusitis and congestion can potentially improve sleep apnea in these individuals. Medications are also available that could increase daytime wakefulness in people who suffer from sleep apnea. These medications stimulate the brain through an unknown mechanism of action. The prototypical drug in this class is called modafinil (Provigil). Studies have revealed greater resolution of daytime sleepiness when using modafinil in patients with sleep apnea. A similar, newer drug in this class, called armodafinil (Nuvigil), has a longer half-life and is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in people with sleep apnea. Armodafinil has shown similar clinical results in significantly improving daytime quality of life and functioning. It is important to note that the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains CPAP (described below). Stimulants, such as modafinil (Provigil) and armodafinil, are recommended for those who have excessive daytime sleepiness despite proper CPAP use at night. They are not meant to replace CPAP use, but rather, as an adjunctive therapy to CPAP in those who have daytime symptoms even with CPAP use. Approximately one third of people who use CPAP at night for sleep apnea may continue to have somnolence during the day. This is the population that could benefit from using modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil). It decreases apneas and hypopneas. It decreases sleepiness as measured by surveys and objective tests. It improves cognitive functioning on tests. It improves driving on driving simulation tests and decreases the number of accidents in the real world."
What are the surgical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea?,"'There are many surgical options to treat obstructive sleep apnea. The type of surgery that is chosen is dependent on an individual\'s specific anatomy and severity of sleep apnea. People often want surgery because it promises a cure with a single treatment. Surgery sounds easier than losing 10 pounds and more convenient than wearing a dental appliance or mask every night. However, surgery is not the ""miracle cure"" either. Most surgeries are safe; however every surgery, no matter how small, carries risks. Most surgeries require time off from work to heal and some are quite painful for up to 2-3 weeks. Some of the potential general risks of surgery include:''Surgery should be considered only after all the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery are understood. Some insurance companies require a 3+-week trial of treatment with CPAP before they will even consider authorizing surgery for sleep apnea. This is not an unreasonable approach. CPAP, if tolerated, controls most sleep apnea, and this may be better than surgical options. It is difficult to have a serious, permanent complication using CPAP as compared to the possibility of such a complication with surgery.'""Any surgical treatment for sleep apnea must address the anatomic problem areas. There may be one or several areas that compromise airflow and cause apnea. Surgical treatments can address the nose, palate, tongue, jaw, neck, obesity, or several of these areas at the same time. Each surgery's success rate is determined by whether or not a specific airway collapse or obstruction is prevented. Therefore, the ideal surgery is customized for each patient and depends on each patient's specific problem. Some surgical options include:""'Many people have several levels of obstruction and, therefore, these surgical techniques frequently are performed together (for example, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with genioglossus advancement and hyoid suspension).''It is rare for obstructive sleep apnea to be caused by nasal obstruction alone. The nasal ''cavity'' can be obstructed by swelling of the turbinates, septal deviation, and nasal polyps. Surgeries to address each of these potential causes of obstruction can improve the flow of air through the nasal passages. Nasal surgery is most successfully used for sleep apnea to improve the effectiveness of CPAP. Nasal obstruction makes CPAP difficult if not impossible to tolerate. Surgery to open the nasal passages markedly improves tolerance to CPAP.''Various surgical procedures that stabilize the tissue at the roof of the mouth (palate) and walls of the throat (pharynx) have been described. The effectiveness of the procedures depends on the tissues involved with collapse of the airway in addition to what is happening elsewhere in the airway. Traditionally, an uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) was developed. It is a long and fancy term to describe a surgery aimed at preventing collapse of the palate, ''tonsils'', and pharynx which is common in sleep apnea. UPPP is most successful in patients who have large tonsils, a long uvula (the most posterior part of the palate that hangs down in the back of the throat), or a long, wide palate. It also is more successful in patients who are not obese.''An UPPP operation is performed under general anesthesia and the patient is completely asleep. In simple terms, the tonsils are removed, the uvula is removed, and the palate is trimmed. All of the surgical ''cuts'' are closed with ''stitches''. UPPP may require an overnight stay in the hospital to monitor breathing and to control pain. UPPP is a painful operation similar to a ''tonsillectomy'' in an adult (tonsillectomy in children is less painful). Frequently, it is recommended for patients undergoing UPPP to take 10 days to 2 weeks off from work. In the postoperative period, people usually are on a liquid only diet and require liquid pain medication.''A UPPP is successful a majority of the time in preventing or decreasing obstructive sleep apnea. Studies also have demonstrated a decrease in mortality and decrease in risk of car accidents after UPPP. Some people who have a ""successful UPPP"" and fewer episodes of apnea, still have to use a CPAP after surgery to completely control their obstructive sleep apnea but it has also been shown to improve the quality of life in many individuals following surgery.''There are complications that are unique to UPPP.''A more recently developed surgical therapy involves implantation of a small generator that stimulates the hypoglossal nerve to the tongue and upper airway muscles during sleep. As described, obstructive sleep apnea for many patients occurs when the muscles of the airway relax naturally during sleep. UAST therapy attempts to overcome the impact of that muscle relaxation and subsequent obstruction.''Initial studies evaluating the ability of UAST to stabilize the airway have been very promising in select patients for 3 years and longer. One device is FDA-approved and provides therapy for patients who meet certain criteria, including previously failed medical therapy or CPAP. Implantation of the device includes the placement of a small generator in the anterior chest wall (similar to a cardiac ''pacemaker'') with a stimulation lead placed around the hypoglossal nerve in one side of the neck. An additional sensory lead measures the breathing cycle to determine the timing of stimulation. Patients turn the device on before they go to sleep using a small hand held remote. There are no external hoses. This is considered the only surgery that does not alter the anatomy of the airway, however there are certain risks to consider and other contraindications.''In some people with obstructive sleep apnea, the area of collapse is between the base of the tongue and the back wall of the throat (pharynx). Several surgeries have been used to decrease the size of the base of tongue and to open the airway. Most of these procedures are performed as an addition to other surgical procedures. Midline glossectomy is one method to decrease the size of the tongue. Under general anesthesia, various devices may be used to cut a trough down the middle of the base of the tongue. The difficulty with this procedure is to remove enough tissue to prevent collapse without changing the natural functions of the tongue during speaking and swallowing. This procedure may be considered for people who have had collapse in the lower part of the airway below the palate and tonsils.\xa0Combined with other surgical procedures, midline glossectomy has been reported to be very successful.''The tongue base has also been the focus of surgical procedures to shrink the base of the tongue by scarring. Tissue that ''scars'' usually shrinks in size. For example, radiofrequency energy has been used to injure and scar the base of tongue. Usually the first treatment is performed under general anesthesia. A radiofrequency probe is placed in the muscle of the back of the tongue and energy is delivered. Over time, the tissue scars and shrinks. Frequently, several treatments are applied to the tongue. The later treatments can be performed in the setting of an office.''One complication of radiofrequency treatment is an infection or ''abscess'' in the tongue. An abscess in the tongue can narrow the airway and may require surgical treatment. A 17% reduction in volume of the tongue has been measured using this technique; however, this is generally not a successful technique if it is used alone. Therefore, reduction of the base of the tongue is frequently combined with UPPP or other procedures.''The genioglossus muscle is the muscle that attaches the base of the tongue to the inside front of the jaw bone. Genioclossus advancement or tongue suspension are types of surgical methods to reposition the tongue and relieve obstruction in the lower portion of the upper airway during sleep. The genioglossus pulls the tongue forward. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, it has been shown that the genioglossus is more active in holding the airway open at rest. When the genioglossus muscle relaxes during sleep the airway narrows and collapses. There are several procedures that pull the tongue forward to enlarge the airway. A genioglossus advancement typically detaches the part of the jaw bone where the muscle attaches and moves it forward about 4 mm. This pulls the base of the tongue forward. Genioglossus advancement is performed under general anesthesia and requires cutting the bone and screwing it back in place. This usually is performed in combination with hyoid suspension or UPPP.''There also are less invasive methods to advance the genioglossus muscle. One method uses a stitch through the base of the tongue that attaches to a screw on the inside of the jaw. This method may be less invasive; however it is thought to be less effective and less permanent.''The hyoid bone helps support the larynx and tongue in the neck. It is located below the mandible and tongue, but above the laryngeal cartilages. It is not directly attached to any other bones, but rather is attached to strap muscles above and below. The strap muscles elevate or depress the larynx during swallowing. As part of a surgery to bring the tongue and soft tissues up and forward, the hyoid bone may be suspended. This is usually performed with other surgical procedures, such as an UPPP or genioglossus advancement.''In general, the hyoid bone is sutured up closer to the mandible. This pulls the tongue forward and up. This procedure is very rarely done alone without other surgical procedures. Like other surgical procedures for obstructive sleep apnea, hyoid suspension has an adequate success rate when performed in an appropriately selected patient.''Maxillomandibular advancement is a surgical procedure that moves the jaw and upper ''teeth'' forward. This pulls the palate and base of the tongue forward and opens the airway. This procedure is best suited for a thin patient with a small jaw or patients with craniofacial, boney abnormalities. Both the jaw and maxillary bones are cut, moved forward, realigned, and plated into place. Care must be taken to keep the teeth aligned and preserve a normal bite and, therefore, the procedure usually is performed by an oral surgeon. The nerve to the front teeth and lip passes through the jawbone and is at risk for injury. Care must be taken to preserve the nerve so that there is normal sensation. In appropriate patients, maxillomandibular advancement has up to a 90% success rate for at least two years but longer term effectiveness is variable.''Palate implants stiffen the palate. In select patients, they may prevent the palate from collapsing into the pharynx where it can obstruct the airway. They also decrease the vibrations of the palate that cause snoring. Palate implants have now been approved for people with mild sleep apnea; however, they are successful for only a small group of people with mild sleep apnea and palate collapse. A 250 pound man with an apnea-hypopnea index of 50 and decreases in blood oxygen to 85% will probably not be cured with a palate implant.''A tracheostomy is a procedure to bypass the narrowed airway. The trachea is the specialized tube that connects our larynx (voice box) to the lungs. It can be felt in the lowest part of the neck in most people. If the obstruction to airflow is occurring above the larynx, a tracheostomy can be inserted to direct airflow directly into the trachea. The tracheostomy tube is passed through the skin of the lower neck directly into the trachea. This surgery is performed under general anesthesia and requires observation postoperatively for complications in the intensive care unit.''Tracheostomy generally is reserved for morbidly obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who are not candidates for other treatments. They usually can keep the tracheostomy tube capped during the day while breathing normally through their nose and mouth, and then open the tracheostomy tube at night. That way, they will have a normal voice and mouth breathing while awake, and breathe through the tracheostomy tube only at night.''A tracheostomy can be a temporary procedure, kept in place only as long as it is needed. It is easy to remove the tube, and the body will usually heal the skin and close the opening rather quickly. Tracheostomy has close to a 100% rate of cure for obstructive sleep apnea because it bypasses the problem in the upper airway. In mixed sleep apnea obstructive apneas resolve immediately, but in central apneas, which are due to metabolic changes caused by the obstructive apneas, it usually take some time for the apneas to resolve. Studies have shown improvements in sleepiness, ''hypertension'', and cardiac risks following tracheostomy.''While it can be extremely effective, there are risks and complications of tracheostomy.''Most patients do not need to resort to a tracheostomy for sleep apnea; however it is a life-saving procedure for a few patients.''Bariatric (obesity) surgery is a type of surgery in obstructive sleep apnea. It is effective because most sleep apnea is caused by or worsened by obesity. Bariatric surgery is associated with a marked reduction in weight post-operatively. One study demonstrated an average weight loss of 120 pounds and an improvement in RDI from 96 to 11. All patients had at least a 55% decrease in their respiratory disturbance index.''Bariatric surgery is only an option for morbidly obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea. There is a 10% morbidity (illness, disease) rate associated with this type of surgery as well as a 1% mortality (death) rate. Patients can regain the weight they lost after surgery. Bariatric surgery, like the other surgical procedures that have been discussed, has significant risks and is not suitable for most patients with obstructive sleep apnea.' bleeding, infection, scar tissue, pain, loss of work, change in voice, problems swallowing, failure to cure sleep apnea, anesthesia risks (including allergic reaction, stroke, heart attack, and death), and other unforeseen surgical complications. nasal airway surgery, palatal and pharayngeal surgery (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty), upper airway stimulation therapy, tongue reduction, tongue repositioning or genioglossus advancement, hyoid suspension, maxillomandibular procedures, palatal implants, tracheostomy, bariatric surgery, and combinations of the above. Bleeding in the area of the tonsils may occur up to 14 days after surgery in about 3% of people. Occasionally, a second operation is needed to stop this postoperative bleeding. If large amounts of scar tissue form with the healing that follows the surgery, in particular between the nose and back of the mouth, the scarring can result in an airway that is narrower than it was preoperatively. This can result in nasal and pharyngeal stenosis, a difficult problem to treat. Velopalatal insufficiency is another complication of UPPP. One job of the palate is to close the back of the nose and direct food and liquids down the throat during swallowing. If the palate is too short or it cannot move far enough back, sometimes liquids may enter the nose during swallowing. Velopalatal insufficiency frequently is a temporary problem after surgery, but it may become permanent in up to 2% of people. The uvula and palate are used in some languages (for example Hebrew and Farci) to produce guttural fricative sounds. After UPPP, that sound cannot be made and may make some words difficult to pronounce. The palate also closes the nose during speech to prevent a ""nasal"" sounding voice. Some changes in voice can be permanent after UPPP. The first is a psychosocial problem. Most people do not want to walk around with a tube coming out of their neck. The tracheostomy hole must be cared for and cleaned daily. Local infections or scar tissue can form around the hole on the inside or outside. Because of the tube, some people get recurrent infections in the bronchi (the tubes through which air passes from the trachea to the lungs). Severe life-threatening bleeding occurs rarely if the tube erodes into a major blood vessel in the neck. The trachea may stay narrowed at the tracheostomy site after the tube is removed. This may necessitate further surgery."
Why is it important to treat obstructive sleep apnea?,"'When a person with obstructive sleep apnea considers all the options for treatment, he or she may be tempted to not choose any of them. The masks and dental appliances have to be worn every night and the surgeries are painful and have no guarantee that they will be successful. When considering the consequences of all the treatments, however, it is important to remember that there are consequences of not receiving treatment. '""It is estimated that only a small percentage of patients with obstructive sleep apnea are being treated. Some of the remaining people with obstructive sleep apnea know that they have a problem, but they choose not to pursue treatment. People with obstructive sleep apnea may have a right to accept the risks to their health that refusing treatment poses; however, when they drive they put everyone else at risk as well. People who refuse treatment for their obstructive sleep apnea should be reported to the DMV, which often will suspend their driver's licenses.

What is appendicitis?," Appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix becomes inflamed. The appendix is a finger or worm-shaped pouch that projects out from the cecum (the beginning of the colon). In most individuals, the appendix becomes inflamed because its tissues become infected with bacteria, and pus may develop within the lumen of the appendix. Mechanical blockage of the appendix by hard stool, a foreign body, or thick mucus may also lead to bacterial infections. The signs and symptoms of appendicitis may include aching pain that begins around the umbilicus (belly button) and then shifts to the lower right abdomen. The pain may be sharp and can increase by movements such as walking or coughing. Many individuals may develop nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, constipation, inability to pass gas, and abdominal swelling. Individuals may also develop diarrhea. A common sign of appendicitis is deep tenderness at the McBurney's point (the location of McBurney's point is about 2/3 the distance starting from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine); however, young children and pregnant females may experience pain elsewhere in the abdomen."
What is appendectomy?,"'Appendectomy'' is the surgical removal of the appendix. This procedure is most often performed as an emergency operation. In some patients undergoing abdominal surgery for another reason, may have their appendix removed prophylactically so that ''appendicitis'' does not develop in the future; this option can be discussed with your surgeon. '''  "
How do I prepare for an appendectomy?,"'The majority of appendectomy operations are typically emergency surgeries so the patient needs to follow the instructions given by the surgeon. In general, the patient is advised not to eat food, although with the symptoms, they are usually not hungry anyway. The patient may be treated with medications to reduce or eliminate ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''; IV antibiotics may also be initiated before surgery.' "
How is an appendectomy performed?,"""Appendectomy is most often done in the operating room after the patient's skin has been shaved to remove hair and swabbed with a germ killing solution; sterility precautions are taken to prevent infection. The appendix may be removed by an open method or the laparoscopic technique. The open method requires a 2 to 3 inch incision in the lower right–hand side of the abdomen to remove the appendix, while the laparoscopic method uses several small incisions in the abdomen and the use of a laparoscope to visualize and then remove the appendix."" "
What is the recovery time for an appendectomy?,"'The recovery time for an appendectomy is variable and depends on the type of the procedure, type of anesthesia, and any complications that may have developed. For example, laparoscopic appendectomy may be done on an outpatient basis so that the patient can be discharged to recover at home, while an open method may require an overnight stay or an even longer time to be discharged to go home. Normal activities can resume in a few days but full recovery may take 4 to 6 weeks during which time strenuous activity should be avoided.'  "
What are the complications and risks of appendectomy?,"   Wound infection is the most common complication of an appendectomy. Abscess formation in the area of the removed appendix or surgical incision site may also occur.  Other relatively infrequent or rare complications may include ileus (lack of intestinal peristalsis), surgical injuries to internal organs or structures, gangrene of the bowel, peritonitis (infection in the peritoneal cavity) and bowel obstruction."
Are there long-term consequences of removing the appendix?,"'For most individuals there are no long-term consequences of removing the appendix. However, some individuals may have an increased risk of developing anincisional ''hernia'', stump appendicitis (infections due to a retained portion of the appendix), and bowel obstruction.' "
What is an appendectomy?,"'Appendectomy'' is the surgical removal of the ''appendix''. It is most often performed as an emergency surgery for ''appendicitis''. Occasionally while a patient undergoes an abdominal surgery for other reasons, the appendix might be removed to prevent possible future ''appendicitis''.' "
What is an appendix?,"'The vermiform appendix is a finger-shaped sac attached to the cecum, the beginning part of the colon, in the lower right abdomen. The appendix produces a protein that helps fight infection, however, its presence does not appear to be vital for an adult. Other parts of the body take over its function when it is removed.' "
Why is an appendectomy performed?,"'An ''appendectomy'' is performed when the appendix is inflamed or ruptured causing acute ''pain'', ''fever'', ''nausea'' and other symptoms.' "
What are the types of appendectomy?,"'Appendectomy might be:''Laparoscopic surgery has certain advantages over open surgery such as''The surgeon may opt for an open surgery or decide to convert a laparoscopic surgery into an open one in certain situations including:' Open or conventional surgery: performed with an incision of about 2 to 4 inches that enables the surgeon to view and gain access to the appendix.

The surgeon performs the operation using a laparoscope, a tube fitted with a video camera, inserted through the incision, with tiny surgical tools. shorter hospital stay quicker healing less post-surgery pain less scarring rupture of appendix severe and extensive infection or abscess inability to visualize appendix due to  patient’s obesity scar tissue or adhesions from previous surgery patients with  bleeding disorders severe pulmonary diseases heart diseases"
How is an appendectomy performed?,"'A general surgeon performs an appendectomy under general anesthesia, and the procedure may entail hospital stay.' The patient is likely to have acute pain and nausea, so the doctor might immediately administer painkillers, antibiotics for infection and medicine to control the nausea. The patient must avoid eating or drinking anything 8 hours prior to the surgery. The patient must check with the surgeon before taking any regular medication. The patient must inform the surgeon of any medical conditions and allergies, or if pregnant. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the surgery. The surgeon makes one or more incisions, depending on the type of surgery, in the lower right part of the abdomen where the appendix is located.

The removed appendix is sent for testing. The patient may be discharged the same day or the next day depending on the type of surgery, unless there is serious infection. The patient must follow diet restrictions for a few days and avoid strenuous activity."
How long does it take to recover from an appendectomy?,"'With a laparoscopic surgery, a patient is often able to resume normal activities in one to three weeks. An open surgery may require about two to four weeks for recovery. With a ruptured appendix, it may take up to six weeks or more.' "
Is appendectomy a major surgery?,"'Appendectomy is a common emergency surgery widely performed all over the world. It lasts for about an hour, and recovery is generally quick for both the open and laparoscopic surgery.' "
What are the side effects of an appendectomy?,"'Appendectomy is one of the safest surgical procedures, however; it carries a few risks and possible complications including:' Anesthetic side effects Bleeding and blood clots Infection or abscess Injury to nearby organs Peritonitis or abdominal swelling Abdominal pain Bowel obstruction Gangrene in the bowel Hernia at the incision Stump appendicitis or infection in the remaining appendix stump"
What is the appendix? Do you need it?,"'The appendix is a closed-ended, narrow, worm-like tube up to several inches in length that attaches to the cecum (the first part of the colon). (The anatomical name for the appendix, vermiform appendix, means worm-like appendage.) The inner lining of the appendix produces a small amount of ''mucus'' that flows through the open central core of the appendix and into the cecum. The wall of the appendix contains lymphatic tissue that is part of the immune system. Like the rest of the colon, the wall of the appendix also contains a layer of muscle, but the layer of muscle is poorly developed.'""It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body in older children and adults. In young children, it may have an immune function. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease."" "
What is appendicitis? What causes it?,"'Appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to ''stool'' that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or ''stool'' hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a ""fecalith"" (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, it might be that the lymphatic tissue in the appendix swells and blocks the opening. After the blockage occurs, bacteria which normally are found within the appendix begin to multiply and invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. If the symptoms of appendicitis are not recognized and the inflammation progresses, the appendix can rupture, followed by spread of bacteria outside of the appendix. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue that lines the wall of the appendix, for example, inflammation that causes swelling and buildup of pressure within the appendix that causes it to rupture.''After rupture, infection can spread throughout the abdomen; however, it usually is confined to a small area surrounding the appendix by the surrounding tissues, forming a peri-''appendiceal'' abscess.''Sometimes, the body is successful in containing (""healing"") the appendicitis without surgical treatment if the infection and accompanying inflammation cause the appendix to rupture. The inflammation, ''pain'', and symptoms also may disappear when antibiotics are used. This is particularly true in elderly patients. Patients then may come to the doctor long after the episode of appendicitis with a lump or a mass in the right lower abdomen that is due to the scarring that occurs during healing. This lump might raise the suspicion of ''cancer''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of appendicitis? Is it painful?,"'Early signs and symptoms of appendicitis often are mild, consisting merely of a loss of appetite and/or nausea and a sense of not feeling well. There may not be even ''abdominal pain''.''Nevertheless, as the course of the appendicitis progresses the main symptom becomes abdominal ''pain''.''If not already present, a second symptom of appendicitis is loss of appetite, which may progress to nausea and even vomiting. Nausea and vomiting may occur later due to ''intestinal obstruction'' from the expanding inflammatory mass or abscess rather than from local inflammation.''As appendiceal inflammation increases, it may extend through the appendix to its outer covering and then to the lining of the abdomen, a thin membrane called the peritoneum. Once the peritoneum becomes inflamed, the character of the pain changes and then can be localized clearly to one small area. Generally, this area is between the front of the right hipbone and the ''belly button'"". The exact point is named after Dr. Charles McBurney-McBurney's point. If the appendix ruptures and infection spreads throughout the abdomen, the pain becomes diffuse again as the entire lining of the abdomen becomes inflamed.""   The pain is at first diffuse and poorly localized, that is, not confined to one spot. (Poorly localized pain is typical whenever a problem is confined to the small intestine or colon, including the appendix.) The pain is so difficult to pinpoint that when asked to point to the area of the pain, most people indicate the location of the pain with a circular motion of their hand around the central part of their abdomen. With time, the pain may localize to the right lower abdomen, and the patient may be able to identify an exact location of the pain."
What tests diagnose appendicitis?,"'The diagnosis of appendicitis begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Patients often have an elevated temperature, and there usually will be moderate to severe tenderness in the right lower abdomen when the doctor pushes there. If inflammation has spread to the peritoneum, there is frequently rebound tenderness. Rebound tenderness is pain that is worse when the doctor quickly releases his or her hand after gently pressing on the abdomen over the area of tenderness. It is due to the sudden rebound of the peritoneum after it has been deformed by finger pressure.''The white blood cell count usually becomes elevated with infection. In early appendicitis, before infection sets in, it can be normal, but most often there is at least a mild elevation even early in the process. Unfortunately, appendicitis is not the only condition that causes elevated white blood cell counts. Almost any infection or inflammation can cause the count to be abnormally high. Therefore, an elevated white blood cell count alone cannot be used to confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis.''Urinalysis is a microscopic examination of the urine that detects ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine. Urinalysis usually is abnormal when there is inflammation or stones in the kidneys or bladder. The urinalysis also may be abnormal with appendicitis because the appendix lies near the ureter and bladder. If the inflammation of appendicitis is great enough, it can spread to the ureter and bladder leading to an abnormal urinalysis. Most patients with appendicitis, however, have a normal urinalysis. Therefore, a normal urinalysis suggests appendicitis more than a urinary tract problem.' "
What happens if the appendix ruptures?,"'On occasion, a person may not see their doctor until appendicitis with rupture has been present for many days or even weeks. In this situation, an abscess usually has formed, and the ''appendiceal perforation'' may have closed over. If the abscess is small, it initially can be treated with antibiotics; however, an abscess usually requires drainage. A drain (a small ''plastic'' or rubber tube) usually is inserted through the skin and into the abscess with the aid of an ''ultrasound'' or ''CT scan'' that can determine the exact location of the abscess. The drain allows pus to flow from the abscess out of the body. The appendix may be removed several weeks or months after the abscess has resolved. This is called an interval appendectomy and is done to prevent a second attack of appendicitis.' "
What is the treatment for appendicitis? Is surgery necessary?,"'Once a diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy), usually is performed. Antibiotics usually are begun prior to surgery and as soon as appendicitis is suspected. More recently it has been suggested that with milder degrees of inflammation and no complications that antibiotics alone are adequate.''There is a small group of patients in whom the inflammation and infection of appendicitis remain mild and localized to a small area. The body is able not only to contain the inflammation and infection but to resolve them as well. These patients usually are not very ill and improve during several days of observation. This type of appendicitis is referred to as ""confined appendicitis"" and may be treated with antibiotics alone. The appendix may or may not be removed later. There is still some controversy, however, about leaving the healed appendix in place since appendicitis can recur.''On occasion, a person may not see their doctor until appendicitis with rupture has been present for many days or even weeks. In this situation, an abscess usually has formed, and the appendiceal perforation may have closed over. If the abscess is small, it initially can be treated with antibiotics; however, an abscess usually requires drainage. A drain (a small plastic or rubber tube) usually is inserted through the skin and into the abscess with the aid of an ultrasound or CT scan that can determine the exact location of the abscess. The drain allows the pus to flow from the abscess out of the body. The appendix may be removed several weeks or months after the abscess has resolved. This is called an interval appendectomy and is done to prevent a second attack of appendicitis.'  "
What is an appendectomy (surgery)?,"'New techniques for removing the appendix involve the use of the laparoscope. The laparoscope is a thin telescope attached to a video camera that allows the surgeon to inspect the inside of the abdomen through a small puncture wound (instead of a larger incision). If appendicitis is found, the appendix can be removed with special instruments that can be passed into the abdomen, just like the laparoscope, through small ''puncture wounds''. The benefits of the laparoscopic technique include less post-operative pain (since much of the post-surgery pain comes from the incisions) and a speedier return to normal activities. An additional advantage of laparoscopy is that it allows the surgeon to look inside the abdomen to make a clear diagnosis in cases in which the diagnosis of appendicitis is in doubt. For example, laparoscopy is especially helpful for menstruating women in whom a rupture of an ''ovarian cyst'' may mimic appendicitis.''If the appendix is not ruptured (perforated) at the time of surgery, the patient generally is sent home from the hospital after surgery in one or two days. Patients whose appendix has perforated are sicker than patients without perforation, and their hospital stay often is prolonged (four to seven days), particularly if peritonitis has occurred. Intravenous antibiotics are given in the hospital to fight infection and assist in resolving any abscess.''Occasionally, the surgeon may find a normal-appearing appendix and no other cause for the patient\'s problem. In this situation, the surgeon will usually remove the appendix. The reasoning in these cases is that it is better to remove a normal-appearing appendix than to miss, and not treat appropriately, an early or mild case of appendicitis. In addition, if patients have ""appendicitis"" like pain again, the doctor will know that the appendix has been removed, and the diagnosis of appendicitis is not possible.'   During an appendectomy, an incision two to three inches in length is made through the skin and the layers of the abdominal wall over the area of the appendix. The surgeon enters the abdomen and looks for the appendix, which usually is in the right lower abdomen. After examining the area around the appendix to be certain that no additional problem is present, the appendix is removed. This is done by freeing the appendix from its mesenteric attachment to the colon, cutting the appendix from the colon, and sewing over the hole in the colon. If an abscess is present, the pus can be drained with drains that pass from the abscess and out through the skin. The abdominal incision then is closed."
What is the recovery time for an appendectomy (surgery)?,"'Recovery from an appendectomy depends on the severity of the inflammation. If inflammation is mild, recovery can take a few days to a week.\xa0 If there has been more extensive inflammation such as an abscess or localized perforation of the appendix, recovery might take several weeks.\xa0 Free rupture of the appendix into the peritoneal ''cavity'' (abdomen) may require even longer.\xa0 Recovery has become much faster with the substitution of laparoscopic for “open” surgery.' "
What is confined appendicitis?,"'There is a small group of patients in whom the inflammation and infection of appendicitis remain mild and localized to a small area. The body is able not only to contain the inflammation and infection but to resolve them as well. These patients usually are not very ill and improve during several days of observation. This type of appendicitis is referred to as ""confined appendicitis"" and may be treated with antibiotics alone. The appendix may or may not be removed later. There is still some controversy, however, about leaving the healed appendix in place since appendicitis can recur.' "
"What is ""stump appendicitis?""","'When the appendix is removed surgically, a small portion may be left behind. This piece of appendix may become inflamed and is prone to develop all of the complications of appendicitis. Thus, it is possible for individuals who have had their appendix ""removed"" to develop another episode of appendicitis. Stump appendicitis is treated similarly to appendicitis with an intact (surgically unremoved) appendix. It is important to consider early and diagnose stump appendicitis since inadequate diagnosis and treatment can result in a rupture of the inflamed stump.' "
What procedures diagnose appendicitis?,"'An abdominal x-ray may detect the fecalith (the hardened and calcified, pea-sized piece of stool that blocks the appendiceal opening) that may be the cause of appendicitis. This is especially true in children. Nevertheless, the presence of a fecalith can occur without appendicitis.''An ultrasound is a painless procedure that uses sound waves to provide images to identify organs within the body. Ultrasound can identify an enlarged appendix or an abscess. Nevertheless, during appendicitis, an enlarged inflamed appendix or abscess can be seen in only 50% of patients. Therefore, not seeing the appendix during an ultrasound does not exclude appendicitis. Ultrasound also is helpful in women because it can exclude the presence of conditions involving the ovaries, Fallopian tubes and uterus (''pelvic inflammatory disease'', PID) that can mimic appendicitis.'""A barium enema is an X-ray test in which liquid barium is inserted into the colon from the anus to fill the colon. This test can, at times, show an impression on the colon in the area of the appendix where the inflammation from the adjacent inflammation impinges on the colon. Barium enema also can exclude other intestinal problems that mimic appendicitis, for example Crohn's disease.""'In patients who are not ''pregnant'', a CT scan (a type of X-ray study) of the area of the appendix is useful in diagnosing appendicitis and peri-appendiceal abscesses as well as in excluding other diseases inside the abdomen and pelvis that can mimic appendicitis.''Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure in which a small fiberoptic tube with a camera is inserted into the abdomen through a small puncture made on the abdominal wall. Laparoscopy allows a direct view of the appendix as well as other abdominal and pelvic organs. If appendicitis is found, the inflamed appendix can be removed with the laparoscope. The disadvantage of laparoscopy compared to ultrasound and CT is that it requires a general anesthetic.''Currently, there is no test for appendicitis that will definitively diagnose the infection. Therefore, the approach to suspected appendicitis may include a period of observation, tests as previously mentioned, or surgery.' "
Why is it difficult to diagnose appendicitis?,"'It can be difficult to diagnose appendicitis. The position of the appendix in the abdomen may vary. Most of the time the appendix is in the right lower abdomen, but the appendix, like other parts of the intestine, has a mesentery. This mesentery is a sheet-like membrane that attaches the appendix to other structures within the abdomen. If the mesentery is large, the appendix to move around. In addition, the appendix may be longer than normal. The combination of a large mesentery and a long appendix allows the appendix to dip down into the pelvis (among the pelvic organs in women). It also may allow the appendix to move behind the colon (called a retro-''colic'"" appendix). In either case, inflammation of the appendix may appear to be more like the inflammation of other organs, for example, of a woman's pelvic organs.""'The diagnosis of appendicitis also can be difficult because other inflammatory problems may mimic appendicitis, for example, right side ''diverticulitis''. Therefore, it is common to observe patients with suspected appendicitis for a period to see if the problem will resolve on its own or develop characteristics that more strongly suggest appendicitis or, perhaps, another condition.' "
What are the complications of appendicitis? Can they be life-threatening?,"'The most frequent complication of appendicitis is perforation. Perforation of the appendix can lead to a peri-appendiceal abscess (a collection of infected pus) or diffuse peritonitis (infection of the entire lining of the abdomen and the pelvis). The major reason for appendiceal perforation is delay in diagnosis and treatment. In general, the longer the delay between diagnosis and surgery, the more likely is perforation. The risk of perforation 36 hours after the onset of symptoms is at least 15%. Therefore, once appendicitis is diagnosed, surgery should be done without unnecessary delay if the patient does not improve with antibiotics alone.''A less common complication of appendicitis is blockage or obstruction of the intestine. Blockage occurs when the inflammation surrounding the appendix compresses the intestine, and this prevents the intestinal contents from passing. If the intestine above the blockage begins to fill with liquid and ''gas'', the abdomen distends, and greater nausea and vomiting may occur. It then may be necessary to drain the contents of the intestine through a tube passed through the nose and ''esophagus'' and into the stomach and intestine.''A feared complication of appendicitis is ''sepsis'', a condition in which infecting bacteria enter the blood and travel to other parts of the body. This is a very serious, even life-threatening complication. Fortunately, it occurs infrequently.'  "
Which specialties of doctors treat appendicitis?,"'A person with appendicitis may be seen first by family practitioners, internists, and pediatricians. However, usually the person is evaluated by a general or another type of surgeon. Once appendicitis is suspected, a general surgeon always is consulted in case surgery is necessary.' "
What other conditions can mimic appendicitis?,"'The surgeon faced with a patient suspected of having appendicitis always must consider and look for other conditions that can mimic appendicitis. Among the conditions that mimic appendicitis are:' Meckel's diverticulitis. A Meckel's diverticulum is a small outpouching of the small intestine, which usually is located in the right lower abdomen near the appendix. The diverticulum may become inflamed or even perforate (break open or rupture). If inflamed and/or perforated, it usually is removed surgically. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The right Fallopian tube and ovary lie near the appendix. Sexually active women may contract infectious diseases that involve the tube and ovary. Usually, antibiotic therapy is sufficient treatment, and surgical removal of the tube and ovary are not necessary. Inflammatory diseases of the right upper abdomen. Fluids from the right upper abdomen may drain into the lower abdomen where they stimulate inflammation and mimic appendicitis. Such fluids may come from a perforated duodenal ulcer, gallbladder disease, or inflammatory diseases of the liver, for example, a liver abscess. Right-sided diverticulitis. Although most diverticuli are located on the left side of the colon, they occasionally occur on the right side. When a right-sided diverticulum ruptures, it can provoke inflammation that mimics appendicitis. Kidney diseases. The right kidney is close enough to the appendix that inflammatory problems in the kidney-for example, an abscess-can mimic appendicitis. Ectopic pregnancy: Although it usually is easy to differentiate between a normal intrauterine pregnancy, if the fetus implants in the fallopian tube or elsewhere instead of the uterus, the symptoms may mimic appendicitis."
What are the complications of appendectomy?,"'The most common complication of appendectomy is an infection of the wound, that is, of the surgical incision. Such infections vary in severity from mild, with only redness and perhaps some tenderness over the incision, to moderate, requiring only antibiotics, to severe, requiring antibiotics and surgical treatment. Occasionally, the inflammation and infection of appendicitis are so severe that the surgeon will not close the incision at the end of the surgery because of concern that the wound is already infected. Instead, the skin closing is postponed for several days to allow the infection to subside with antibiotic therapy and make it less likely for infection to occur within the incision. Wound infections are less common with laparoscopic surgery.''Another complication of appendectomy is an abscess, a collection of pus in the area of the appendix or pelvis. Although abscesses can be drained of their pus surgically, there are also non-surgical techniques, as previously discussed.'""It is not clear if the appendix has an important role in the body in older children and adults. There are no major, long-term health problems resulting from removing the appendix although a slight increase in some diseases has been noted, for example, Crohn's disease."" "
What is new about appendicitis?,"'Recently, it has been hypothesized that some episodes of appendicitis-like symptoms, especially recurrent symptoms, may be due to an increased sensitivity of the intestine and appendix from a prior episode of inflammation. That is, the recurrent symptoms are not due to recurrent episodes of inflammation. Rather, prior inflammation has made the nerves of the ''intestines'' and appendix or the central nervous system that innervate them more sensitive to normal stimuli, that is, with stimuli other than inflammation. This will be a difficult, if not impossible, hypothesis to confirm.' "
What is antiphospholipid syndrome? What are antiphospholipid syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder of the immune system that is characterized by excessive clotting of blood and/or certain complications of ''pregnancy'' (premature miscarriages, unexplained fetal death, or premature birth) and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (such as anti-cardiolipin or ''lupus'' ''anticoagulant'' antibodies) in the blood. Clotting disorders associated with antiphospholipid syndrome include ''stroke'',\xa0''blood clots'' deep within the legs (deep venous thrombosis, or ''DVT'') and clots in the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism'', or PE). Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have both blood clots and antiphospholipid antibodies that are detectable with blood testing.''Antiphospholipid syndrome is also called phospholipid antibody syndrome, cardiolipin antibody syndrome, and Hughes syndrome in honor of the doctor who first described it.''It is important to note that antiphospholipid antibodies can also be found in the blood of individuals without any disease process. In fact, antiphospholipid antibodies have been reported in a small percentage of the normal population. Harmless antiphospholipid antibodies can be detected in the blood for a brief period occasionally in association with a wide variety of conditions, including bacterial, viral (''hepatitis'' and ''HIV''), and parasitic (''malaria'') infections. Certain ''drugs'' can cause antiphospholipid antibodies to be produced in the blood, including antibiotics, ''cocaine'', ''hydralazine'', ''procainamide'', and quinine.''Nevertheless, the antiphospholipid antibodies (a protein) are not considered normal blood proteins and have been found to be associated with a number of illnesses. These illnesses include abnormal clotting (thrombosis) of arteries (''stroke'' and infarction) and/or veins, premature miscarriages (spontaneous abortions), abnormally low blood platelet counts (''thrombocytopenia''), purplish mottling discoloration of the skin (''livedo reticularis''), ''migraine'' ''headaches'', and a rare form of inflammation of the nervous tissue of the brain or spinal cord called transverse myelitis. Antiphospholipid antibodies have also been detected in over half of patients with the immune disease ''systemic lupus erythematosus''.''Researchers are recently also finding that there are patients with slowly progressive memory problems and patients with a form of ""atypical ''multiple sclerosis''"" who have antiphospholipid antibodies detectable in their blood.'  "
What are the causes and risk factors of antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'The cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is not completely known. Antiphospholipid antibodies reduce the levels of annexin V, a protein that binds phospholipids and has potent clot-blocking (anticoagulant) activity. The reduction of annexin V levels is thought to be a possible mechanism underlying the increased tendency of blood to clot and the propensity to pregnancy loss characteristic of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Certain genes may be risk factors for the development of antiphospholipid syndrome.''Antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anticardiolipin, have also been associated with decreased levels of prostacyclin, a chemical that prevents the clumping together of normal blood clotting elements called platelets.'

What laboratory tests can support the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'Patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome can have a variety of antibodies to molecules called phospholipids in their blood. These antibodies include VDRL/RPR (a ''syphilis'' test that can be falsely positive in these patients), ''lupus'' anticoagulant, prolonged PTT, beta 2 glycoprotein I antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibody. As mentioned above, the anticardiolipin antibody has also been found in patients with the immune disease ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', which is characterized by the production of a variety of abnormal antibodies.'  "
How is antiphospholipid syndrome treated?,"'The treatment of patients with anticardiolipin syndrome has substantially evolved since cardiolipin antibodies were noted to be clinically important in the mid-1980s. Each manifestation of the antiphospholipid syndrome, and each individual patient with the condition, is treated uniquely.''Because many of the features of illness with anticardiolipin syndrome are associated with an abnormal grouping of normal blood clotting elements (platelets), treatment is often directed toward preventing clotting by thinning the blood. Patients with this disorder have a tendency to form blood clots (thrombosis). The unwanted blood clotting can affect the function of virtually any organ. Medications that thin (anticoagulate) the blood, such as ''heparin'' (''Hep-Lock'', Liquaemin, ''Lovenox'') and ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), are powerful blood thinners that are used for treatment. ''Aspirin'' has an effect on platelets that inhibits their grouping (aggregation) and has also been used in low doses to thin the blood of selected patients with less severe disease. Cortisone-related medications, such as ''prednisone'', have been used to suppress the immune activity and inflammation in patients with certain features of the condition. For patients with systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus who also have antiphospholipid syndrome, ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) has been reported to add some protection against blood clotting.''Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected patients with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Recent research studies, however, suggest that intravenous gamma globulin may be no more effective than a combination of aspirin and heparin.'  "
What is the treatment for antiphospholipid syndrome during pregnancy?,"'The treatment of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome during pregnancy typically involves low dose aspirin and low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox).  Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulins have been infused, but their effectiveness is not proven.' "
What is catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is a variant of antiphospholipid syndrome that is characterized by blockage of many blood vessels throughout the body. As a result of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, many organs can be affected, including the skin, lungs, brain, ''heart'', kidneys, and bowels. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is treated with anticoagulation, ''corticosteroids'' (cortisone medication), and plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).'""Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is rare. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is sometimes referred to as Asherson's syndrome after the researcher who described it in the early 1990s."" "
What is the prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome?,'The prognosis of antiphospholipid syndrome depends on the character and the intensity of its manifestations. Earlier treatment will tend to have better outcomes.' 
Is it possible to prevent antiphospholipid syndrome?,"'If a person is already known to have phospholipid antibodies, it is possible to prevent antiphospholipid syndrome with methods that decrease the chances of blood clotting, including aspirin and/or heparin. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) may have some preventative benefits for selected patients.' "
Symptoms,"'As the disease progresses, symptoms may become more severe or even permanent. Many people with arachnoiditis are unable to work and suffer significant disability because they are in constant pain.' Tingling, numbness, or weakness in the legs Sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg Severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric shock sensation Muscle cramps, spasms and uncontrollable twitching Bladder, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction"
Causes of Arachnoiditis," Direct injury to the spine Chemicals: Dye used in myelograms (diagnostic tests in which a dye called radiographic contrast media is injected into the area surrounding the spinal cord and nerves) have been blamed for some cases of arachnoiditis. The radiographic contrast media responsible for this is no longer used, however. Also, there is concern that the preservatives found in epidural steroid injections may cause arachnoiditis. Infection from bacteria or viruses: Infections such as viral and fungal meningitis or tuberculosis can affect the spine. Chronic compression of spinal nerves: Causes for this compression include chronic degenerative disc disease or advanced spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal column). Complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures: Similar causes include multiple lumbar (lower back) punctures."
Making the Diagnosis,"'Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen.' "

What is ARDS?,"""ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a lung condition that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood. ARDS can be life threatening because your body's organs need oxygen-rich blood to work well.""'People who develop ARDS often are very ill with another disease or have major injuries. They might already be in the hospital when they develop ARDS.'""To understand ARDS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).""""Small blood vessels called capillaries run through the walls of the air sacs. Oxygen passes from the air sacs into the capillaries and then into the bloodstream. Blood carries the oxygen to all parts of the body, including the body's organs.""""In ARDS, infections, injuries, or other conditions cause the lung's capillaries to leak more fluid than normal into the air sacs. This prevents the lungs from filling with air and moving enough oxygen into the bloodstream.""""As a result, the body's organs (such as the kidneys and brain) don't get the oxygen they need. Without oxygen, the organs may not work well or at all.""'People who develop ''ARDS'"" often are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ""'ARDS'', such as severe pneumonia.''If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.' "
ARDS symptoms and signs,"""The first signs and symptoms of ARDS are feeling like you can't get enough air into your lungs, rapid breathing, and a low blood oxygen level.""'Other signs and symptoms depend on the cause of the ARDS. They may occur before ARDS develops. For example, if ''pneumonia'' is causing ARDS, you may have a ''cough'' and ''fever'' before you feel short of breath.''Sometimes, people who have ARDS develop signs and symptoms such as ''low blood pressure'', ''confusion'"", and extreme tiredness. This may mean that the body's organs, such as the kidneys and ""'heart'"", aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood.""""Most people who develop ARDS are in the hospital for other serious health problems. Rarely, people who aren't hospitalized have health problems that lead to ARDS, such as severe pneumonia.""'If you have trouble breathing, call your doctor right away. If you have severe shortness of breath, call 9-1-1.'  "
What causes ARDS?,"'Many conditions or factors can directly or indirectly injure the lungs and lead to ARDS. Some common ones are:'""It's not clear why some very sick or seriously injured people develop ARDS and others don't. Researchers are trying to find out why ARDS develops and how to prevent it."" Sepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream. Pneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs. Severe bleeding caused by an injury to the body. An injury to the chest or head, like a severe blow. Breathing in harmful fumes or smoke. Inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth."
Who is at risk?,"'People at risk for ARDS have a condition or illness that can directly or indirectly injure their lungs.''Conditions that can directly injure the lungs include:''Conditions that can indirectly injure the lungs include:' Pneumonia. This is an infection in the lungs. Breathing in harmful fumes or smoke. Inhaling vomited stomach contents from the mouth. Using a ventilator. This is a machine that helps people breathe; rarely, it can injure the lungs. Nearly drowning. Sepsis. This is a condition in which bacteria infect the bloodstream. Severe bleeding caused by an injury to the body or having many blood transfusions. An injury to the chest or head, such as a severe blow. Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-a-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas becomes irritated or infected. The pancreas is a gland that releases enzymes and hormones. Fat embolism (EM-bo-lizm). This is a condition in which fat blocks an artery. A physical injury, like a broken bone, can lead to a fat embolism. Drug reaction."
How do doctors diagnose the condition?,"'Your doctor will diagnose ARDS based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results.''Your doctor will ask whether you have or have recently had conditions that could lead to ARDS.''Your doctor also will ask whether you have heart problems, such as ''heart failure''. Heart failure can cause fluid to build up in your lungs.''ARDS may cause abnormal breathing sounds, such as crackling. Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to hear these sounds.''He or she also will listen to your heart and look for signs of extra fluid in other parts of your body. Extra fluid may mean you have heart or kidney problems.''Your doctor will look for a bluish color on your skin and lips. A bluish color means your blood has a low level of oxygen. This is a possible sign of ARDS.''You may have ARDS or another condition that causes similar symptoms. To find out, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests.''The first tests done are:''Other tests used to diagnose ARDS include:'   An arterial blood gas test. This blood test shows the oxygen level in your blood. A low level of oxygen in the blood may be a sign of ARDS. Chest X-ray. This test is used to take pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can show whether you have extra fluid in your lungs. Blood tests, such as a complete blood count, blood chemistries, and blood cultures. These tests help find the cause of ARDS, such as an infection. A sputum culture. This test is used to study the spit you've coughed up from your lungs. A sputum culture can help find the cause of an infection. Chest computed tomography (to-MOG-rah-fee) scan, or chest CT scan. This test uses a computer to create detailed pictures of your lungs. A chest CT scan may show lung problems, such as fluid in the lungs, signs of pneumonia, or a tumor. Heart tests that look for signs of heart failure. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This condition can cause fluid to build up in your lungs."
How is ARDS treated?,"""ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.""'One of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.'""Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a ""'breathing tube''. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.''Before inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.''The breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.''Your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.'""You'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).""'This procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a ''tracheostomy'' (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.''Supportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:'   Medicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain. Ongoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange). Nutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube. Treatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections. Prevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots. Prevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk. Fluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels."
What are the complications from ARDS?,"'If you have ARDS, you can develop other medical problems while in the hospital. The most common problems are:' Infections. Being in the hospital and lying down for a long time can put you at risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also puts you at higher risk for infections. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This is a condition in which air or gas collects in the space around the lungs. This can cause one or both lungs to collapse. The air pressure from a ventilator can cause this condition. Lung scarring. ARDS causes the lungs to become stiff (scarred) and makes it hard for them to expand and fill with air. Being on a ventilator also can cause lung scarring. Blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in your body. A blood clot that forms in a vein deep in your body is called a deep vein thrombosis. This type of blood clot can break off, travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, and block blood flow. This condition is called pulmonary embolism."
Living with ARDS,"'Some people fully recover from ARDS. Others continue to have health problems. After you go home from the hospital, you may have one or more of the following problems:''These health problems may go away within a few weeks, or they may last longer. Talk with your doctor about how to deal with these issues. Also, see the suggestions below.''You can take steps to recover from ARDS and improve your quality of life. For example, ask your family and friends for help with everyday activities.''If you smoke, quit. ''Smoking'' can worsen lung problems. Talk to your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid ''secondhand smoke'' and other lung irritants, such as harmful fumes.''If you have trouble quitting ''smoking'' on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people ''quit smoking''.''Go to pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab) if your doctor recommends it. Rehab might include ''exercise'' training, education, and counseling. Rehab can teach you how to return to normal activities and stay active.''Your rehab team might include doctors, nurses, and other specialists. They will work with you to create a program that meets your needs.''Living with ARDS may cause fear, ''anxiety'', ''depression'', and ''stress'"". Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking with a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life.""'Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with ARDS. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk to your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center.''Support from family and friends also can help relieve ''stress'' and ''anxiety''. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you.' Shortness of breath. After treatment, many people who have ARDS recover close-to-normal lung function within 6 months. For others, it may take longer. Some people have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Tiredness and muscle weakness. Being in the hospital and on a ventilator (a machine that supports breathing) can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired following treatment. Depression. Many people who've had ARDS feel depressed for a while after treatment. Problems with memory and thinking clearly. Certain medicines and a low blood oxygen level can cause these problems."
What is the prognosis and survival rate for ARDS?,"'More people are surviving ARDS now than in the past. One likely reason for this is that treatment and care for the condition have improved. Survival rates for ARDS vary depending on age, the underlying cause of ARDS, associated illnesses, and other factors. Some studies estimate that the mortality rate for ARDS is 36% to 52% per 100,000 people, depending upon their current health condition.''Some people who survive recover completely. Others may have lasting damage to their lungs and other health problems.''Researchers continue to look for new and better ways to treat ARDS.' "
What are other names for ARDS?," Acute lung injury Adult respiratory distress syndrome Increased-permeability pulmonary edema Noncardiac pulmonary edema ARDS used to be called stiff lung, shock lung, and wet lung."
What are the symptoms of adhesion?	,"'Symptoms of adhesions inside your belly may vary; however, most adhesions do not cause any symptoms. However, it can squeeze the nerves, organs, and joints causing severe internal ''pain'' and may hamper the organ functions (dysfunction).''It may give you confusing symptoms of unexplainable severe internal belly pain that may block or distort the organ or stop their functions. For example, pelvic adhesions can spread to bind nearby organs such as the bowel, bladder (urine pouch), uterine tubes, or ovaries. You may have\xa0' Severe abdominal pain or cramping. Nausea. Vomiting. Long-term bloating. Altered bowel habits. Inability to pass gas. Constipation. Infertility. Pain during urinating. Pain during sex. Pain during passing stool. Pain during menses."
What are the treatment options for adhesions?,"'Most adhesions do not appear on imaging tests such as ''X-rays'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'', computed tomography scans, or ''ultrasonography''. Therefore, direct visualization during surgery is the only definitive way to diagnose them. All surgeries can cause adhesions. Thus, a conservative approach is required to examine a medical history of healing events to determine the cause of your pain and dysfunction.\xa0''Lysis of adhesions through ''laparoscopy'' (through small keyhole incisions on your belly) or through a large incision.''Surgeries to remove these adhesions can lead to new adhesions that can be a vicious cycle. Even with surgical advancement, the patient and physician cannot prevent the adhesions completely. Despite the best skills of the finest surgeon, our body creates more adhesions to heal injuries even from the surgery that intended to remove them.' Symptomatic treatment: Currently, there are no effective targeted medicinal therapies for adhesions. However, symptomatic treatment can be given to ease the pain, vomiting, and constipation such as a change in diet, painkillers (paracetamol and ibuprofen), stool softeners, etc. Surgery: Removing the adhesion by surgery will help you to ease this pain and prevent further complications of adhesions."

Potential health benefits of bananas,"'Bananas are highly nutritious:' One medium-sized banana contains the following nutrients:Potassium: 12% of the RDI (recommended dietary intake)Vitamin B6: 20% of the RDIManganese: 15% of the RDIVitamin C: 17% of the RDIMagnesium: 8% of the RDICopper: 5% of the RDIFiber: 3.1 grams Potassium: 12% of the RDI (recommended dietary intake) Vitamin B6: 20% of the RDI Manganese: 15% of the RDI Vitamin C: 17% of the RDI Magnesium: 8% of the RDI Copper: 5% of the RDI Fiber: 3.1 grams Bananas are rich in fiber and low in calories: One medium-sized banana provides around 12% of the recommended daily fiber intake. Fiber is essential for good digestive health and reduces risks of heart diseases, several intestinal diseases, and cancers. Fiber results in early satiety (feeling full early and for longer), which helps reduce calorie consumption in other forms in the long term. Unripe bananas contain higher resistant starch: The type of carbohydrates in a banana depends on its ripeness. Unripe bananas are green and contain high resistant starch, while ripe, yellow bananas mostly contain natural sugars. Resistant starches are resistant to digestion and help in reducing blood sugar and weight. However, unripe bananas are not as tasty and may be difficult for people to eat because they cannot be eaten as it is. Bananas are filling, easy to eat, and affordable: Bananas make a quick and easy, filling, low-calorie snack that can help with weight loss and weight maintenance. Bananas are easily available, affordable, not messy, and can be eaten on the go."
Are bananas fattening for you?,"'There is no scientific evidence that eating bananas may cause ''weight gain''. Bananas contain a minimal amount of ''fats''. The carbohydrate content in a ripe banana is around 28 grams per 100-gram serving. The total calorie content in 100 g of bananas is around 110 calories. Bananas as such are not fattening. They may rather make you feel full for longer because of their fiber content. Their sweet taste and creamy texture may also help reduce cravings for unhealthy desserts, such as pastries and doughnuts. Studies show that bananas may help prevent weight gain. They can be included in a regular healthy ''diet'', which includes three to five servings of fruits every day. Snacking on fruits and vegetables instead of processed foods, such as cookies and chips helps in ''weight management''. If you wish to ''lose weight'' for achieving a healthy weight, you need to reduce your overall calorie intake. Consuming bananas when kept within your calorie requirements will not make you gain weight.' "
What are the health benefits of bananas?,"'Bananas are packed with several nutrients which have several health benefits, such as:' Healthy heart and blood vessels: Bananas contain minerals like potassium, which are needed for a healthy heartbeat. They also contain several antioxidants and fiber needed for a healthy heart and regulation of blood pressure. Healthy gut and digestion: Bananas are rich in fiber that help in bowel movement. This also helps eliminate toxins from the gut and keep the gut healthy. They are a part of the BRAT diet, which helps the gut recover from a bout of stomach flu. Weight management: Bananas contain fiber that helps you stay full for a long time. This helps in limiting calorie intake and weight reduction. Their sweet taste and creamy texture may also help reduce cravings for unhealthy desserts, such as pastries and doughnuts. Studies show that bananas may help prevent weight gain. They can be included in a regular healthy diet that includes three to five servings of fruits every day. Sleep: Bananas contain the amino acid, tryptophan, which is used in the body to make the substance serotonin. This helps promote calmness and sleep. Bananas may also help in getting over stress and depression. Healthy source of energy: Bananas are excellent food options for getting energy, such as after exercise or on the go during a busy morning. Healthy vision: Bananas contain a good amount of Vitamin A, which is used to make the pigment called rhodopsin in the retina (the light-sensitive layer inside the eye). Rhodopsin is necessary for night vision."
What are bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs'"" are parasites (insects) that survive by feeding on blood from humans. They are small, brownish-colored, and live in furniture cracks, beds (especially the mattress, box springs, and other structures such as the bed frame) but also can be found in travelers' suitcases and other items. Their highest ""'concentration'' is usually within about 8 ''feet'' of a location where people ''sleep''. They are active (seek a blood meal) at nighttime and just before dawn; they usually bite any exposed area of the skin (for example, the arms, hands, neck, and face). The bite is usually painless, but eventually multiple bite sites resemble a ''rash'' and become itchy. ''Bedbugs'' are not known to readily transmit other diseases, although a few investigators suggest that rarely, ''hepatitis B'' and/or ''Chagas disease'' may use ''bedbugs'' as a vector for these diseases.' "
Are bedbugs contagious?,"'Bedbugs'' are not ''contagious'"" in the sense that they live on people and are transmitted directly from person to person. What happens is that bedbugs utilize humans for a blood meal and then leave the person's body. It seems like bedbugs may be contagious because they can live in some people's clothing, bedding, and furniture. These items, when utilized or transported during travel, can contain bedbugs waiting to encounter another warm body for a blood meal. Most experts suggest that the main hosts for bedbugs are humans and indicate that pets like ""'dogs'' and cats usually are not bitten (not all experts agree on this); however, bedding material used for pets may serve as a site for bedbugs especially if the pet bed is located close to bedding used by pet owners.' "
How do I know if I have bedbugs?,"'Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a person has been bitten by bedbugs. Because the insects leave the person\'s body after a bite, and bites usually occur when a person is sleeping, many people do not know how they got this ""itchy ''rash''."" In most instances, there are no lab tests used to detect bedbugs; however, simply using a magnifying glass while examining items such as mattresses or clothing (especially the seams in mattresses and cracks in furniture) for bedbugs, their eggs, or droppings is usually the quickest and best way to determine a ''bedbug'' infestation.' "
How do bedbugs spread?,"'Bedbugs are not spread directly from person to person. As stated above, they are spread by travelers and/or people who come in contact with bedding, clothing, or furniture that contains bedbugs. Travelers can have bedbugs infest their luggage and thus can transport bedbugs back to their home. Bedbugs, once established in a residence, can travel to reach individuals through ventilation ducts, water pipes, and even gutters. Bedbugs have even been shown to cross over ceilings and then drop down onto a person to get a blood meal from an individual.' "
How will I know when I am cured of bedbugs?,"'Bedbugs usually require the services of an exterminator to kill the insects. Exterminators may use various methods such as chemical insecticides and/or heat treatments to kill the insects. Once the insects are killed, the biting stops and the person is ""cured"" of ''bedbug bites''.' "
When should I call a medical caregiver about bedbugs?,"'Individuals who have been bitten by bedbugs and who have other diseases that may be rarely transmitted by these insects (for example, ''hepatitis B'') should inform their caregivers and ask for advice about bedbugs being a vector for their disease. Similarly, family members of such individuals should contact their physician if they get bedbug bites as they may be exposed to the disease in a family member. Anyone developing ''shortness of breath'' and/or swelling of the neck or tongue after a bedbug bite should go to an emergency department.' "
What is a boil?,'A ''boil'' is a bacterial ''skin infection'' of a ''hair follicle''. ''Boils'' contain pus. ''Boils'' are usually caused by staphylococcal bacteria. ''Boils'' are also known as furuncles.' 
Are boils contagious?,"'There is some controversy about ''boils'' being ''contagious''. Some experts say the boils themselves are not ''contagious'"" because they can occur from bacteria normally found on the skin. Others, however, say that boils are contagious because it is possible for person-to-person transfer of bacteria if a person's infected boils touch the skin of another person, who then may also develop boils."" "
What is the incubation period for boils?,"'Although the most common range of the incubation period for staphylococci is about four to 10 days, boils caused by these bacteria that are normally found on the skin are considered to have a variable incubation period.' "
How will I know if I have boils?,"'A ''boil'' begins when the skin turns red and tender in the area of the infection. After about four to seven days, the tender lump often starts to turn the skin whitish as pus collects under the skin. Some boils may spontaneously burst and leak out pus. Others may expand to form an ''abscess''.' "
How do boils spread?,"'It is possible for boils to spread to another person if bacteria from the initially infected person contact the skin of another person who is susceptible to the infecting bacteria. However, a boil can spread in the skin of an infected individual to become an ''abscess'' or develop into a clump of boils (carbuncle). Severe infections can lead to ''fever'', ''lymph node'' swelling, and more severe complications of infection, such as ''sepsis''.' "
When will I know if I am cured of boils?,"'Boils can be cured once the pus drains out of the boil and the infecting bacteria are eliminated. When this occurs, the symptoms of skin redness, swelling, and ''pain'' resolve after a few days. Some smaller boils that are not deep in the skin may spontaneously drain while others may require a physician to incise the boil so that pus can drain out. Both topical antibiotics and occasionally oral antibiotics are given to eradicate infecting bacteria. Large boils may require gauze packing to help facilitate ''pus drainage''. The gauze is usually removed in one or two days.' "
When should I contact the medical caregiver about boils?,"'Individuals should seek medical care for boils if they start ''running'' a ''fever'', have severe ''pain'"" at the site of the boil, the boil doesn't drain, if other boils begin to appear, or if a red streak extends from a boil. Individuals with ""'heart murmurs'', immune system ''depression'', ''diabetes'', or those who are taking medicines that alter the immune system should contact their physician urgently if they develop a boil.' "
What are canker sores?,"'Canker sores'' are small painful ulcers in the mucous membranes that form the inner lining of the mouth. The cause of ''canker sores'' is unclear; no viral or bacterial cause has been proven. Researchers think that they occur or are triggered to occur in individuals when a certain set of circumstances arise such as''Canker sores'' can recur. ''Canker sores'' are sometimes confused with ''cold sores'', but ''cold sores'' are due to ''herpes'' ''viruses'' and are ''contagious'', while canker sores are not ''contagious'' and usually do not involve the lips.''Canker sores also are referred to as' emotional stress, hormonal changes, allergies, certain diseases (including Crohn's disease and celiac disease), a lack of certain nutrients and vitamins, sensitivity to certain chemicals in foods or drinks, or even minor trauma while tooth brushing or other minor mouth trauma. aphthous ulcers, aphthous stomatitis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and ulcerative stomatitis."
Are canker sores contagious?,"'Canker sores are not contagious. There is no person-to-person spread. Canker sores seem to develop in an individual when certain triggers occur (such as hormonal shifts, ''stress'' or exposure to certain foods or chemicals). Individuals that develop canker sores may not have the same triggers that cause canker sores to develop in other people.' "
What are the canker sore symptoms?,"'Shallow painful ulcers with a reddish border are characteristic of canker sores. They may appear on the soft palate, tonsil areas, tongue, and gums of the mouth. There are three types of canker sores: minor, major, and herpetiform.' Minor canker sores are usually smaller than 1 cm in diameter and account for about 80% of all canker sores. Major canker sores are greater than 1 cm in diameter, usually have irregular borders, and when they heal, the ulcers can leave scars and even distort the shape of the mucosal surface. Herpetiform canker sores are small - no larger than 1 mm - and usually occur in clusters (about 10–100 ulcers). Herpetiform canker sores are poorly named as they do not contain herpes viruses."
How do canker sores spread?,'Canker sores do not spread from person-to-person. Canker sores are recurrent and may seem to spread in an individual if the mechanisms that trigger ''canker sore'' development recurs frequently in an individual.' 
How do you get rid of canker sores?,"'There is no known cure for canker sores. There is only treatment for the painful symptoms. However, most minor ''canker sore'' problems last about 7 to 10 days while major canker sores may last weeks to months and may cause ''scars''.' "
When should I contact a doctor about canker sores?,"'Most minor canker sores do not require a doctor to treat them. However large canker sores (major canker sores) should be seen by a health-care professional. In addition, rapidly reoccurring sores (new canker sores occurring before older sores heal), sores that persist longer than two weeks, sores that cause problems with either eating or drinking, and sores associated with high ''fevers'' should be seen urgently by a physician.'

When should you start taking the class?,'It is advisable to register early for a childbirth class as the childbirth classes get filled up early.''Childbirth classes can be taken' In the last trimester of pregnancy (most recommended). A few days before you go into labor. Throughout the pregnancy (can help you prepare well in advance).
What are the different types of childbirth classes?,"'Different types of classes cover a variety of topics and teach you skills regarding childbirth. Some are refresher courses whereas some deal with in-depth knowledge regarding different kinds of birth, such as:''Some classes also teach you hypnobirthing, which is a technique that teaches you how to hypnotize yourself to achieve a painless and comfortable delivery.''There are two broad methods taught in childbirth classes. These are ''Lamaze'' and Bradley. Talk with your healthcare provider to decide about the type of method suitable for you. A childbirth class is generally focused on one of the two methods.'

Are cold sores and canker sores the same thing?,"'Although ''cold sores'' and ''canker sores'' have similarities, they are entirely different conditions.''Canker sores'' are not ''contagious'', but ''cold sores'' are. Canker sores show up inside the mouth, while ''cold sores'' are often seen on the lips.''Cold'' sores''Canker sores\xa0' Cold sores are infectious. It is also known as a fever blister or recurrent herpes labialis. Cold sores are caused by a virus called HSV-1. They are contagious and extremely painful for the first few days. First-time outbreaks may usually involve other symptoms, such as headache, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches and a sore throat. These sores are typically seen as a cluster of small blisters that quickly rupture to form small ulcers. The ulcerations may later extend to the skin around the mouth and become covered with a crust or scab. Usually, cold sores appear outside the mouth, under the nose, around the lips or under the chin. Lesions are commonly preceded by itching, burning and/or tingling sensations. Cold sores usually are triggered by fever, emotional or physical stress, hormonal changes and/or decreased functioning of the immune system. They can be passed on to another person through kissing and sharing things that go in or near your mouth (like spoons or lipstick). They generally heal within 7 to 10 days with or without treatment. Applying petroleum jelly or aloe vera extracts or ice on the sores may numb the pain and speed up the healing process. In recurrent cases, doctors may prescribe antiviral drugs and creams, such as Valacyclovir. To prevent a recurrence, individuals may need to maintain a hygienic lifestyle. Eating foods enriched with vitamin E and C may help in boosting the immune system. These sores are not usually infectious and are rarely contagious. Canker sores are small round ulcers that appear inside the mouth usually on the inside of the cheek or near the gums. Canker sores are an autoimmune response of the body that damages the skin inside the mouth after a local injury. They might be triggered by poor diet, local injury, food allergies, spicy food and vitamin deficiencies. Rarely, a virus may cause canker sores. They often have a gray punched-out center and a white or yellow edge surrounded by redness. The sores bleed easily, usually when brushing the teeth. They usually last for several days. Occasionally, they may last for 1 to 2 weeks before disappearing. Canker sores are usually healed within 14 days. They may be treated with over-the-counter medications, such as Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Anesthetic ointment or gel may be applied for a short period to numb the pain. Dabbing a bit of cortisone or milk of magnesia on the affected area to coat the ulcer may reduce the pain. Gargling with warm salt water or a solution of baking soda and water can shorten the healing time and reduce pain as well. A high-quality antimicrobial oral rinse may also help in the healing process. Avoiding highly acidic or spicy foods and eating a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients may prevent recurrence. A toothpaste devoid of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is known to prevent the recurrence of canker sores."
Should I be worried about cold sores and canker sores?,"'To summarize, canker and cold sores have characteristics that distinguish them from one another. Both sores are nuisances more than anything and they are not a major threat to health, but they are quite bothersome. Finding out whether you have a ''canker sore'' or a ''cold sore'' is the first step towards finding an effective treatment. Some people also deal with recurrent cold sores and canker sores. For a recurrent cold sore, the doctor may give suppression therapy with a daily antiviral to reduce the frequency of outbreaks. You should also see a doctor for repeated canker sores. This can be a sign of an autoimmune disease or a vitamin deficiency. Both canker sores and cold sores are two different conditions that signal ''weakness'' in the immune system. Fortunately, the immune system can be boosted with a healthy diet and a hygienic lifestyle.' "
"What are cold sores (fever blisters, HSV-1 HSV-2)?","  Cold sores are inflamed blisters in or near the mouth and lips. A herpes virus causes cold sores. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes about 80% of cold sores while herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) causes about 20%. Cold sores are often confused with canker sores. Canker sores are not caused by herpes viruses, are not contagious, and occur mainly inside the mouth, not on the surface of the lips."
Are cold sores contagious?,"'Cold sores are contagious. About 600,000 individuals per year in the U.S. develop an infection with HSV-1. By the age of 70, studies suggest about 90% of the U.S. population has been exposed to HSV-1. About 80% of HSV-1 ''cold sore'' infections result in little or no symptoms or signs.' "
How will I know if I have cold sores?,"'There are several stages of cold sore development.' The first stage consists of symptoms like tingling, itching, inflammation, and hypersensitivity of skin in the location where the sore or blister will later appear. In about two days, blisters begin to appear usually at the junction of the upper and lower lip. Blisters are filled with clear or yellowish fluid and may come together or merge. In some individuals, large numbers of blisters develop. After about two days, the blisters begin to rupture and produce grayish-reddish sores. This a weeping stage where highly contagious fluid oozes from the sores for about one to two days. The sores then develop scabs that last for two to three days. The scabs then begin to break up and may ooze blood. Secondary scabs form and are usually smaller and slowly disappear, revealing pinkish skin that gradually heals. Usually, there is no scarring and the cold sores go through this whole process in about seven to 10 days, although some may persist as long as two or three weeks. The time from infection to the development of symptoms (incubation period) ranges from two to 12 days for cold sores."
How are cold sores transmitted?,"'Cold sores are spread person to person by direct and indirect contact.' They can be spread by kissing, oral/genital contact, and by indirect methods such as sharing eating utensils, razors, clothing, or other items. Although HSV-1 can be spread to the genitals, spread is less frequent (about 20%) than a similar herpes virus, HSV-2 (about 80%). Cold sores caused by HSV-1 are not considered to be a sexually transmitted disease."
When will I know if I am cured from cold sores?,"'Unfortunately, there is no cure for cold sores. However, treatment is available to reduce symptoms and signs.''Unfortunately, cold sores can be recurrent when certain triggers (such as ''stress'' and certain medications) allow the viruses to reproduce. Cold sores usually recur in the same area, with decreasing intensity. Most cold sores are diagnosed clinically without tests. However, there are blood tests available that can distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2.' Over-the-counter treatments are available to provide symptomatic relief. Docosanol (Abreva) is an over-the-counter treatment that may decrease the time to heal the lesions. Prescription medications include several antivirals, such as acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex), and famciclovir (Famvir), and are usually used for more severe symptoms and signs."
When should I seek medical care for cold sores?,"'Most normal individuals do not need to contact a physician about cold sores caused by herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1). However, if an individual (adult or child) has a weakened immune system (such as from ''HIV'', ''cancer'', undergoing ''chemotherapy'') or if symptoms are severe, frequently recurring, or persist longer than two weeks, or include eye irritation, they should contact their physician. These situations require evaluation of both the cold sores and any underlying problems that may predispose to developing cold sores.' "
What are collagen fillers?,"'Collagen is a natural body protein responsible for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness. After a particular age, the body stops producing collagen, and this makes you prone to the signs of ''aging'' like ''wrinkles'' and facial sagging.''Injecting collagen fillers into the skin is a quick fix to achieve a more youthful and radiant look at a fraction of the cost of a ''facelift''. The collagen fillers may be safely used to correct moderate to deep facial ''wrinkles'' and folds along with the nose and lips.''The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved injecting collagen fillers in the face and back of the hand. These can be used to reduce crow’s ''feet'' around eyes, mouth, and forehead to reduce frown lines. It is also used for smoothing fine depressions over the face and reducing ''acne'' scars. It can plump up the lips, lift sunken cheeks, and smooth out ''wrinkles'' at the back of the hand.''Collagen injections'' (commercially known as Bellafill) is a cosmetic procedure done by injecting collagen, which is made up of bovine (cow) collagen, under your skin.' "
What are the side-effects of collagen filler?,"'The collagen fillers are derived from a cow protein. They also contain the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads and lidocaine, a local anesthetic to help make the procedure as painless as possible.''The main adverse effect of the filler is a reaction to cow protein or lidocaine; hence, a prior skin sensitivity test is a must.''Other adverse events to the collagen fillers (though rare) are:''Overall, the procedure is safe if done in a proper setting. It is always prudent to discuss your expectations with your ''plastic surgeon'' before the procedure. The effects of the collagen fillers are temporary and may need subsequent touch-ups at intervals, depending on the injected site.'

Contact lenses vs glasses,"'Choosing to wear\xa0''eyeglasses''\xa0or\xa0''contact lenses''\xa0for vision correction mostly depends on personal preferences, such as lifestyle, comfort, convenience, and budget. One is not necessarily better than the other; each has its pros and cons in terms of vision, ease of use, and eye health. Below are common advantages and disadvantages of contact ''lens'' and glasses:''Eyeglasses''Advantages:''Disadvantages:''Advantages:''Disadvantages:''People who have been wearing glasses for many years find it difficult to switch to contact lenses later. Although eyeglasses score high on a few parameters, contact lenses score similarly high on others. What may work for one occasion might not for the other and what may be brilliant in one situation might cause you trouble in another. What may be comfortable at one time might cause you ''pain'' at another.' Wearing glasses reduces the need to touch eyes, which in turn reduces the likelihood of irritating eyes or developing an eye infection. Eyeglasses won't exacerbate the problem if a person has dry or sensitive eyes. Eyeglasses generally are cheaper than contact lenses Replacement is not often required unless broken and if prescription changes over time, then only lenses can be changed. Frames are fashionable and may suit a person’s personality and style. Glasses offer some protection from environmental factors, such as wind, dust, and debris. The glasses may come with an ultraviolet guard that will protect the retina from harmful UV rays emitted by laptops and screens. Eyeglasses sit about 12 mm (about a half-inch) from the eyes, so peripheral vision may be distorted. People usually report difficulty focusing on objects and blurry vision when they first start wearing glasses or change prescriptions. Some people don't like how they look in glasses and feel it detracts from their facial aesthetics or hides their features. The edges of lenses may be thick and unappealing, or glasses might make eyes appear unnaturally minified or magnified. Eyeglasses can be affected by the elements, such as precipitation collecting on lenses or when they fog up in cold weather. Some frames may exert constant pressure on your nose and behind your ears, leading to headaches and general discomfort. Contact lenses Contacts conform to the curvature of the eye, provide a wider field of view, and cause fewer vision distortions and obstructions than eyeglasses. Contact lenses don't get in the way when playing sports and exercising. Contacts typically aren't affected by weather conditions and won't fog up in cold weather. People may experiment with different color contact lenses. Some contact lenses can reshape with cornea while they sleep. Overnight orthokeratology (Ortho-k) temporarily corrects myopia, so a person can clearly see the next day without the need for glasses or contacts. People may have trouble applying and removing a contact lens but proper technique and practice should rectify this in most cases. Contacts reduce the amount of oxygen reaching the eye and can cause or increase the severity of dry eye syndrome. Wearing contact lenses will likely contribute to symptoms of computer vision syndrome. Contacts require proper lens care and lens case cleaning each day to avoid potentially serious eye infections. Falling asleep while wearing daily wear contacts, may make eyes dry, gritty, red, and irritated. Contacts are expensive to purchase and maintain."
What healthy habits can keep the contact lens safe?,"'Some of the healthy habits that can promote long-term safety of lens are as follows:' Don’t sleep in your contact lens as it can increase the risk of infection by eight folds. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling the lens. Keep the contact lenses away from water, as it can lead to infection. Rub and rinse the contact lenses with the prescribed contact lens solution only. Dispose of the solution before refilling the lens case. Never just “top” off the solution. Do not change the contact lens solution without consulting the doctor. Replace the contact lens at least once every three months; better use disposable contact lenses. Remove contact lenses while swimming or during any water sports. Always dry your hands before handling the contact lenses. Regularly visit your eye doctor. Always carry a backup pair of glasses with the current prescription. Never keep contact lenses in saline or sterile water solution. Never use contact lenses intended for someone else. Eye make-up is ideally avoided with contact lenses in the eye."
What are the benefits of using contact lenses?,"'The benefits of contact lenses include:' It corrects the following vision problems:Myopia (near-sightedness characterized by blurred vision far away)Hyperopia (Far-sightedness characterized by blurred vision close-up)Astigmatism (blurred vision, both far away and close-up)Presbyopia (blurred vision close-up in older adults) Myopia (near-sightedness characterized by blurred vision far away) Hyperopia (Far-sightedness characterized by blurred vision close-up) Astigmatism (blurred vision, both far away and close-up) Presbyopia (blurred vision close-up in older adults) It can feel and look natural as it moves with the eyes. It may help slow the development of near-sightedness in children and teens. It does not fog up like glasses when outdoors. Well-fitting contact lenses remain in place on the eyes and improve side vision during sports and activities. It can be cosmetically appealing and can also improve the person’s confidence."
What are the risks of using contact lenses?,"'Complications that arise with the usage of contact lenses can be effortlessly resolved by temporarily not wearing the lenses. Most of the risks associated with contact lens use may cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. The risks associated with contact lens usage include:''Consult a doctor immediately, if the following symptoms do not resolve hours after removing the lens:' Allergies of the eyes Dry eyes Giant papillary conjunctivitis (bumps that show up beneath the eyelid) Corneal abrasion (a scratch or scrape on the cornea) Corneal infiltrates (inflammation of the cornea causing irritation) Neovascularization (new blood vessels growing onto the cornea causing eye redness) Contact Lens-induced Acute Red Eye (CLARE) (redness or irritation caused due to contact lenses) Microbial keratitis (infections of the cornea) Ptosis (eyelids start drooping) Corneal ulcer (open sore caused by the fungus, bacteria, or parasite infection) Diminished corneal reflex (reduces the protective mechanism of the eye where the brain signals the eyelids to close to protect the eyes) Light sensitivity Intensifying pain in or around the eyes Unexpected blurry vision Irritated, red eyes Unusually watery eyes or discharge"
What is a hickey?,"'Hickeys are dark red or purple bruises on the skin caused by light biting or suction, resulting in the blood vessels under the skin to break. A normal hickey is not dangerous and may fade within two weeks.'""Hickey's size and color change over the healing process, which you can expect as follows:"" During the first stage, the hickey will appear as a reddish mark under the skin. With a day or two, the hickey appears darker because the hemoglobin in the blood changes color. By the fourth or fifth day, the hickey starts to fade and may appear blotchy. Finally, after two weeks, the hickey may fade to a light yellowish color depending on the amount of damage."
How to get rid of a hickey?,'You can get rid of hickeys by trying out the following methods:''You can also conceal the hickey by' Applying a cold compress on the mark for one to two days to reduce swelling and bleeding Taking painkillers for hickeys that are painful and stinging Applying a warm compress after two days to the hickeys to increase the blood flow Massaging the hickey area to stimulate blood flow and reduce pain Applying aloe vera paste to soothe swelling and pain Applying cocoa butter once or twice a day on that area to speed up the healing process Eating more citrus-based fruits and applying vitamin C–enriched cream to the affected area daily Including more of vitamin K–rich foods and applying vitamin K cream on the hickey area may help fade the marks and hasten the healing process Applying makeup over the area. Wearing a turtleneck or scarf around the neck. Wearing a collared shirt. Covering the hickey with a bandage.
Are hives (urticaria) contagious?,"'Hives'' are a particular ''rash'"" that's characterized by ""'itchy'', raised, whitish or pinkish welts on the skin. They may occur on one area of the body, such as the stomach or arms, or occur all over the body. Hives ''rash'' is triggered by the release of histamine in the skin and is caused by an ''allergic'' response. A wide variety of foods, medicines, conditions, and chemicals can cause hives, including foods (such as strawberries and seafood), ''drugs'' (such as ''penicillin'' and sulfa), and infections (viral, bacterial, and parasites). Frequently, the agent that triggers a hives rash is not detected. Hives are also known as ''urticaria''.''Hives themselves are not ''contagious'' unless they contain agents such as ''viruses'' that can be transmitted from an infected individual to another. The vast majority of hives are not contagious. Hives occur more frequently in children and in females. In general, hives decrease and disappear within about 24-48 hours if the affected individual is no longer exposed to the allergic agent. If hives last longer than days or weeks, they may be termed chronic ''urticaria''.'  "
How long will it be before someone knows if he or she is going to get hives?,"""Because hives are response to a large number of different triggering agents, most people don't know if they're going to get hives until they encounter the agent. Sometimes hives occur rapidly within a few minutes to hours after contacting the triggering agent. Other times hives may take longer to develop. About 70% of patients who develop hives initially do not know when they encountered the triggering agent. Often the triggering agent is not identified. Some patients know immediately if they're going to get hives if they inadvertently contact the triggering agent that has caused them to develop hives in the past. ""'Pregnant'' women are at increased risk of developing hives.' "
When will someone no longer get hives?,"'Hives are not contagious but result from an agent that is not normally in the body that triggers an allergic response. Individuals who become desensitized to substances that used to trigger hives will no longer get them. This may occur as the patient gets older or by desensitization procedures by a specialty physician (immunologist or dermatologist). Alternatively, individuals who know their triggers will no longer get hives if they avoid them (for example, avoiding foods or medicines that are known to cause hives in a particular individual).' "
How do hives spread?,"'Hives are not contagious and are not spread from person to person. For an individual affected by hives, the rash can occur in localized areas or over many areas such as the chest, back, and extremities. For some individuals, the stronger the allergic response, the more quickly and widespread over the body hives may be. ''Antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') or ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax) may prevent or reduce spread of hives an individual. Epinephrine may be used in treating severe hives.' "
What specialists treat hives?,"'Most patients who develop hives will need no medical treatment. Although pediatricians and primary care physicians can treat hives, sometimes some specialists are needed. Specialists who often treat hives are emergency-medicine specialists, dermatologists, and ''allergy'' and immunology specialists.' "
Are there home remedies for hives?,"'If your hives are mild and you need no emergency care, there are things that can help reduce symptoms of hives. To possibly prevent or at least reduce the symptoms associated with hives, you can do the following:' Cool the area that has hives with a cool shower, wet towels, or a fan. Wear loose, light clothing to decrease any irritation of the skin. Do not scratch or irritate the area. Avoid any known triggers of hives. For some patients, topical lotions may soothe the skin."
When should someone seek medical care for hives?,"'If hives become widespread and the person develops any ''wheezing'', throat tightening, ''difficulty swallowing'', and/or ''shortness of breath'"", the individual or the individual's parents should immediately seek emergency care. Such individuals may require injected epinephrine (""'EpiPen'') to prevent ''airway'' compromise. Patients who have chronic urticaria should contact their doctors for an evaluation.'  "
Are lazy eyes genetic?,"'Yes, genetics can play a role in causing lazy eyes. In case of a family history of ''amblyopia'' (''lazy eye''), it is better to consult an eye doctor at two years of age.\xa0''From a child’s birth until their 18th birthday, the brain and eyes form crucial connections. Conditions that block or dim the vision in one or both the eyes can delay these connections.\xa0''This results in vision from one eye being dimmer than another. Eventually, the brain learns to neglect the dim image and the eyesight in the weak eye is lost.' "
What is a lazy eye?,"'Lazy eye'', or amblyopia, is a condition in which one eye has poor vision due to a lack of coordination between the brain and eye. Lazy eyes mainly occur in children and should be treated early. Over time, the brain favors the stronger eye, leading to permanent vision problems. Amblyopia affects three out of 100 children.\xa0' "
What causes a lazy eye?,"'Some of the most common causes of a lazy eye:''Some of the contributing\xa0factors, which increase the risk of getting a lazy eye are:' Refractive errors: In this condition, one eye has a good focus compared to the other. The other eye may have nearsightedness, farsightedness, or blurry vision (astigmatism). This can lead to the brain favoring the stronger eye, ultimately, leading to vision loss in the weaker eye. Strabismus (squint): In this condition, the eyes don’t move together as a pair. One eye might drift in and out.  Cataracts: This condition causes cloudiness in the lens of the eye, blurring vision. It mostly occurs in older people, but in some cases, babies and children can also develop cataracts. Ptosis: A drooping eyelid can obstruct vision. Premature birth Family history of amblyopia Low birth weight Developmental disabilities"
When to see a doctor?,"'Consult a doctor if you notice these signs in the first few years of a child’s life:' Head tilting Wandering eyes  Squinting or shutting one eye A regular eye check is vital if there’s a family history of squint eyes, cataracts, or other eye conditions."
What can I expect during the evaluation of amblyopia?,"'The eye doctor will review your medical history, personal, or family history and look for also signs and symptoms of amblyopia. The doctor examines the vision and eye movement.\xa0''Next, the doctor instills eye drops to dilate the pupils and performs a complete examination of the eyes. This helps the doctor to check for any abnormalities.' "
Can amblyopia be corrected if diagnosed early?,"'Yes, amblyopia can be corrected with better outcomes if diagnosed early. Correction for amblyopia should begin as early as possible to prevent permanent ''blindness''. If there’s a family history of amblyopia, then consulting an eye doctor regularly is necessary.\xa0''Depending on the cause, the correction might involve:' Correction of vision problems like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. The doctor might prescribe glasses to help their eye to focus. Wearing an eye patch over the stronger eye forces the brain to use the weak one. This therapy might improve your vision in a few days. Atropine eye drops to blur the strong eye forcing the brain to use the weak eye. This therapy replaces the need for an eye patch. Surgery might be preferred to treat cataract or strabismus"
Why is pancreas transplant required?,"'The goals of pancreas transplantation include:''Pancreas transplantation is most often performed with simultaneous kidney transplantation in selected patients with type I ''diabetes'' and end-stage ''kidney disease'', who will already be required to take immunosuppressive therapy for the kidney graft. The pancreas requires some surgical reconstruction, using donor blood vessels, to enable it to be then transplanted. Three joins are performed on two arteries and a vein, prior to commencing the recipient surgery. This so-called “back table” surgery is crucial and takes one and a half to two hours in duration. The recipient surgery is often performed using a lower midline incision, with the pancreas joined to the artery and vein on the right side of the pelvis and then the kidney joined to the vessels on the left.''The pancreas is located in the upper area of the abdomen and is an important part of your ''digestive system''. Some of the functions of your pancreas include:''Types of pancreas transplantation include:' Curing diabetes and to allow insulin independence Improve the quality of life  Reduce secondary complications Insulin production  Glucose control  Exocrine (digestive juice) secretion Pancreas-Alone Transplant: This procedure is also known as pancreatic islet transplantation. Islets are important cells of the pancreas. This procedure is performed on patients who have type I diabetes with severe symptoms and poor-quality life. Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK): This procedure involves transplanting the pancreas and kidney simultaneously. Pancreas-after-kidney transplant: This is done after kidney transplantation; the necessity of the pancreas will be determined by the doctor depending on the patients’ health. Simultaneous Cadaveric Donor Pancreas and Liver Donor kidney: This procedure is beneficial because the odds of delayed graft function are lower than SPK, and it has reduced the waiting period, resulting in better results. During the procedure, the recipient’s infected pancreas is left as it is, and a healthy pancreas from the donor is placed in the front part of the abdomen and attached to the blood vessels in the lower abdomen. The donor’s duodenum is connected to either the recipient’s intestine or bladder so that the pancreas functions."
What is the recovery period after pancreas transplant?, 
What are the risks involved in pancreas transplant?,"'Pancreas transplantation is major surgery, and risks should be noted prior to proceeding with the surgery. Risks include:''The side effects of immunosuppressive drugs are as follows:' Reactions to medicines Breathing problems Thrombosis (Clotting) of the arteries or veins of the new pancreas Development of certain cancers after a few years Pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas) Leakage of fluid from the new pancreas where it attaches to the intestine or bladder Rejection of the new pancreas Infection Excessive bleeding Infection Hyperglycemia Failure or rejection of the donor pancreas Immunosuppressive drugs side effects Osteoporosis (brittle bones) Hypercholesterolemia High blood pressure Sensitivity in the skin Puffiness Bloating Swelling in gums Acne Excess hair growth"
What are the common health benefits of shirataki noodles apart from weight loss?,"'Shirataki noodles are sometimes referred to as the miracle noodles. Rightly so, because of the health benefits that include:' Gut health: The dietary fiber in the shirataki noodles serves as a prebiotic. This promotes the growth of good bacteria, and this would support better gut health. Prebiotics also decrease swelling and relieve stress. Prevent the occurrence of colon cancer: Shirataki noodles aren't completely digested. They just pass through the length of the digestive tract. As they move, they stimulate the muscles in the intestines. They clean the digestive tract and promote soft-stool consistency as they pass through. While on their journey, the noodles create healthy, short-chain fatty acids in the body. These can help in lowering the levels of bad cholesterol and boosting the immune system. They can also clean the colon, which aids in mineral absorption. All these actions are essential for general health and may even help prevent the occurrence of colon cancer. Lowers cholesterol levels: The fiber in shirataki noodles also helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the body. The fiber appears to have some beneficial effects on total cholesterol. This includes triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, body weight, and more. Helps patients with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD): The high contents of glucomannan fibers in shirataki noodles may help to lower the insulin spikes in the body. Glucomannan can also lower fructosamine levels, a marker that is used to measure healthy blood sugar levels. All these are helpful in people who suffer from PCOD. Great for diabetes: People with diabetes will also benefit from shirataki noodles because they can aid in stabilizing the fluctuations of blood sugar levels. With the presence of the glucomannan fibers in the noodles, the digestion of food slows down and controls the release of glucose. This control can prevent possible spikes in blood glucose levels. Glucomannan fibers in shirataki noodles are also water-soluble. This makes them essential in stabilizing blood sugar. Other common benefits include:Relieving constipation by encouraging quicker bowel movementsReducing the risk of cancer and other serious diseases by strengthening the activity of the antioxidants in the bodyReducing the thyroid hormone levels in people suffering from hypothyroidismHelping improve overall skin health and preventing acneEncouraging the faster healing of wounds Relieving constipation by encouraging quicker bowel movements Reducing the risk of cancer and other serious diseases by strengthening the activity of the antioxidants in the body Reducing the thyroid hormone levels in people suffering from hypothyroidism Helping improve overall skin health and preventing acne Encouraging the faster healing of wounds"
Do shirataki noodles taste good?,"'Shirataki noodles are usually tasteless until cooked with other ingredients. The smell of the shirataki noodles is not pleasant for everybody. However, one can get rid of this smell by simply soaking and rinsing the noodles with ''cold'' water. It is usually recommended to ''boil'' these noodles in water with half a tablespoon of salt for a couple of minutes. These noodles are considered tasteful if cooked with ''garlic'', ''ginger'', ''soy'' sauce, curry powder, or sesame oil. Many diners may prefer to have this noodle immersed in miso soup because of its balanced taste. For meats, one may add lean pork, chicken, and beef. Green, leafy vegetables and other vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower can be used as well.' "
What is shirataki noodle?,"'Shirataki noodles are made from konjac yam, they are translucent noodles, and are high in glucomannan fiber. Shirataki is Japanese for “white waterfall,” which describes the lucid appearance of the noodles.''Glucomannan fiber is a type of soluble fiber that comes from the root of the konjac plant. Konjac plants grow in Japan, China, and Southeast Asia; these plants are locally known as snake plant and voodoo lily.''Shirataki noodles consist of 3% fiber and 97% water that make these noodles desirable for ''weight loss''.' "
What are the health benefits of shirataki noodles?,"'Shirataki noodles don’t contain any ''vitamins'' or ''minerals'', but these can be added by the manufacturers. Manufacturers may add a small amount of tofu or other ingredients, but the nutritional values of these additions are generally irrelevant. However, shirataki noodles offer a small number of health benefits, which include:' Controlling blood sugar level: The soluble fiber can slow down carbohydrate absorption. They may be a good choice for a ketogenic diet because it helps in weight loss. Controlling cholesterol level: Glucomannan in shirataki noodles increases the amount of cholesterol excreted in the stool so that less is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Relieves constipation: Glucomannan increases bowel movement frequency. It promotes good health of the colon by increasing the healthy gut bacteria."
What are the other health benefits of a keto-friendly diet?,"'The keto-friendly or ketogenic ''diet'' also has health benefits, which include:''It is important to consult a board-certified dietitian before starting a ''keto diet''.' Protection from some kinds of cancers: With a ketogenic diet, your body produces or stores less insulin resulting in protection from some kinds of cancer or alleviates the growth of cancer cells. Prevention of acne: Cutting down on carbohydrates may prevent the formation of acne by reducing hyperinsulinemia. Controlling seizures: Ketogenic diets may help to control seizures. Preventing nervous system disorder: Breakdown of fat results in ketone formation, which may protect brain cells from damage. Some of the nervous system disorder that a ketogenic diet prevent include:Alzheimer’s diseaseParkinson’s diseaseSleep disorders Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease Sleep disorders Polycystic ovary syndrome: High levels of insulin may cause cyst formation in the ovaries. As a ketogenic diet prevents insulin formation, the chances of polycystic ovary syndrome can be reduced."

Are skin rashes contagious?,"'There are ''contagious'' and noncontagious skin ''rashes''. To make this broad topic more manageable, the following is a list of general categories of ''rashes'' that are considered noncontagious:''Since the real question to be answered is what rashes are ''contagious'', the remainder of this short article will address most of those rashes that are considered contagious; not all experts agree on these designations, so readers concerned about a ''rash'' are urged to discuss their individual condition with their physician.''Rashes that are considered by many physicians to be contagious are as follows:''This list is not exhaustive but covers many of the rashes that people may encounter. The definition of ''contagious'' depends on whether the ''rash'' itself can be spread or the infection that causes the rash can be spread, so some experts may not agree with the designations above. For example, in some cases, the rash is contagious in that someone can get the rash from another person with the rash. In other cases, a person with a rash may be at risk of spreading the infection that caused the rash (which may not necessarily cause a rash in the person who gets infected).'  Seborrheic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis Contact dermatitis Stasis dermatitis Psoriasis Nummular eczema Drug eruptions Hives Heat rash (miliaria) Diaper rash Molluscum contagiosum (viral) Impetigo (bacterial) Herpes (herpes simplex, types 1 and 2 viruses) Rash caused by Neisseria meningitides (N. meningitides) (bacterial) Rash and blisters that accompany shingles (herpes zoster virus) Ringworm (fungal) infections (tinea) Scabies (itch mite) Chickenpox (viral) Measles and rubella (viral) Erythema infectiosum (viral) Pityriasis rosea (viral) Cellulitis and erysipelas (bacterial) Lymphangitis (bacterial) Folliculitis (bacterial)"
How will I know if I have a contagious rash?,"'Often, rashes appear in children and adults. Even though some of the ""contagious"" rashes have fairly typical presentations (for example, ''shingles'' has a reddish rash, usually with ''blisters'"", develops on one side of the body along the area supplied by one nerve) but not always. Consequently, if you have had contact with a person who has a known contagious disease that forms a rash, you should contact a physician. Similarly, if you're concerned about a rash that has developed, a physician and/or dermatologist can help diagnose your skin condition. A conservative way to approach rashes is to consider all of them contagious until proven otherwise."" "
How do contagious rashes spread?,"'Most contagious rashes spread from person to person by direct contact. Many of the rashes are ''itchy'' and spread when an infected individual scratches the rash and then touches or scratches another individual who is not yet infected. However, some rashes can easily spread by indirect contact; for example, ''ringworm'' can be easily spread from the locker room floor to another individual by simply ''walking'' on the contaminated floor.' "
How will I know when I am cured of a contagious rash?,"'The possible cure of the contagious rash depends on the underlying cause of the rash. For example, once an individual has been appropriately treated with antibiotics for ''N. meningitidis'' infection, the rash and the patient usually become noncontagious after about 24-48 hours and the rash slowly disappears. To help determine the underlying cause and cure for your rash, speak with a physician.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about a rash?,"'In most cases, if an individual has a noncontagious rash or a noncontagious cause of the rash, there is no need to contact a medical ''caregiver'' emergently unless the rash or and/or underlying cause is rapidly spreading.''If you suspect you have been exposed to a contagious rash, contact your physician early to get appropriate advice and treatment. However, if you know you have been exposed to the rash caused by ''N. meningitidis'', you should contact a medical ''caregiver'' emergently. If you have a rash that is shedding or sloughing off patches or large areas of skin, this is considered a medical emergency and the person should be seen quickly in an emergency department.' "
Are strawberries healthy for your bowels?,"'Animal experiments have been conducted to find out if strawberries can help treat inflammatory conditions of the bowel (intestine). A research was conducted on mice at the University of Massachusetts Amherst; the study found that dietary consumption of whole strawberries may help in the treatment of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'') by suppressing symptoms like body ''weight loss'' and ''bloody diarrhea''.''Another animal study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that strawberry increases the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria and decreases the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria. The research concluded that along with its anti-inflammatory activity, the beneficial effect of strawberries on the gut bacteria may help in maintaining colonic health. Consuming strawberries may help in the prevention of inflammatory diseases of the colon (large bowel).' "

Clinical Trials,"'Breast cancer'' is the second most common ''cancer'' among American women. Around 250,000 women and 2,300 men are diagnosed with ''breast cancer'' each year in the United States. Each year, ''breast cancer'' kills around 42000 women and 510 men in the United States.''With advancements in management options for breast ''cancer'', the survival rate and quality of life of the affected patients have greatly improved. ''Clinical trials for breast cancer'' have played a pivotal role in these advancements. ''Clinical trials'' are the various research studies that involve people. These trials test the safety and benefits of new treatment modalities and how well new combinations or new dosages of already existing medications work. Clinical trials also explore various other aspects, such as ''breast cancer prevention'', diagnosis, and screening strategies.''You can volunteer to get enrolled in a breast ''cancer'' clinical trial. Each trial enrolls people with certain conditions and symptoms. Enrolling in a breast cancer treatment trial will help you receive the\xa0treatment before it is widely available to the public. By participating in the trial, you would help develop the knowledge base to improve breast ''cancer care''.''Clinical trials for breast cancer involve three main phases:''There are various clinical trials presently being conducted for breast cancer. A few of them are:' Phase I: This is the initial phase that tests whether the new promising drugs effectively kill cancer cells in laboratory experiments. It tells about the safe dose for the drugs and their benefits in managing cancer. This phase generally enrolls fewer than 50 patients. Phase II: This phase starts when the safe dose of a drug has been established in the phase I trial. Phase II explores the potential benefit and side effects of the drug. Fewer than 100 patients are enrolled in this phase. Phase III: Phase III begins when the drug or regimen proves promising activity in the phase II trial. This phase involves comparing the new treatment with an existing standard treatment regimen. A comparison may also be done between the new treatment and placebo (such as a sugar pill). Hundreds of thousands of patients may be enrolled in this phase to know whether the new treatment is better than the standard treatment and warrants US FDA approval. Weight loss interventions in treating overweight and obese women with a higher risk for breast cancer recurrence: This is a phase III trial that is dedicated to finding out whether weight loss programs for obese and overweight women diagnosed with breast cancer lowers the risk for breast cancer recurrence. Aspirin in preventing the recurrence of cancer in patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative and HER2-negative breast cancer after chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy: This phase III clinical trial is exploring the effect of the drug Aspirin in preventing breast cancer recurrence. Doxorubicin hydrochloride and cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer: This phase III trial is exploring the role of the drugs Doxorubicin hydrochloride and Cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel with or without Carboplatin in treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Testing the ability to decrease chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have no remaining cancer at surgery after limited pre-operative chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy: This trial explores the effect of the drugs paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab in eliminating further chemotherapy after surgery in patients with HER2-positive stage II-IIIa breast cancer, who have no cancer remaining at surgery (either in the breast or underarm lymph nodes) after preoperative chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy."
What is a wart?,"'A wart is a small growth with a rough texture that can resemble a solid ''blister'' or a small cauliflower. ''Human papillomaviruses'' (''HPV'') cause ''warts'', which can grow on any part of the skin. Some ''HPV'' types are associated with the development of ''malignancy''. Many ''warts'' resolve spontaneously after a few years.' "
What should I know about the various types of warts? Where do warts grow?,"'Common warts'' (body warts) develop in fingers and toes. They are rough, firm, and raised. ''Plantar warts'' develop mainly on the soles of ''feet'', heels, and toes. They grow inward as a dark spot surrounded by white hard tissue. Flat warts grow as flat pinkish or yellow-brown spots on sun-exposed skin surfaces. Filiform warts are skin-colored flaps or elongated tags on the eyelids, nose, neck, and armpits. Periungual warts grow around or under toes and fingers, are raised, and may hinder nail growth. ''Genital warts'' are pink or reddish and look similar to cauliflower and form in clusters of three to four warts.' "
Are warts painful?,"'Most warts are not painful, but periungual warts can be very painful. Plantar warts can cause foot discomfort when ''walking'', and ''genital warts'' may cause mild ''pain'', ''itching'', and some bleeding.' "
Are warts contagious? How do warts spread?,"'Viruses'' that cause warts are ''contagious'"", most frequently by direct skin-to-skin contact, especially if the skin is damaged or cut. It's possible to spread the virus to other parts of your own skin. You also can get them indirectly from contaminated surfaces like a gym mat or shower floor."" "
What is the incubation period for warts?,'The estimated incubation period for genital warts varies from two weeks to eight months. Some warts remain dormant for years.' 
When should I contact a medical caregiver about warts?,"'Most people do not need a medical ''caregiver'' to evaluate most warts or even to treat them. Some people want them removed for cosmetic reasons. However, a medical professionals should examine genital warts, as some may become cancerous.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) drugs get rid of warts fast?,'People may apply ''over-the-counter'' topical salicylic acid treatments to warts; this OTC treatment has a reported 70%-80% cure rate.' 
Is there a cure for warts?,"'Topical agents like salicylic acid are effective, and other agents like podophyllin (Podocon-25), imiquimod (''Aldara'', Zyclara), cidofovir (''Vistide''), and others get rid of warts. Medical professionals may consider intralesional injections and even surgical removal (excision, cauterization, laser, or cryo- and/or electrosurgery) for persistent warts. Systemic ''drugs'' like ''cimetidine'', retinoids, and IV cidofovir provide variable results. The ''HPV vaccine'' can prevent the formation of about 90% of genital warts.' "
How do I know if I'm too sick to work?,"'Are you having troublesome symptoms like ''runny nose'', ''fever'', ''headache'', ''coughing'', or ''sore throat''? Maybe you have ''back pain'' or a ''sinus infection'"" and are wondering if you're too sick to go to work or school. How can you decide whether you or your child is better off trying to work (or go to school) or taking a sick day?""""First and foremost, consider whether you are putting yourself or others at risk if you go to work. You're putting others at risk if you or your children have a ""'contagious'"" illness (more on that later). You're putting yourself at risk if the symptoms of your condition, or the side effects of medication, could cause you to have an accident on the job, injure others, or produce devastating mistakes in your work product. Putting anyone in harm's way is a clear reason to stay home.""'Obviously going to work when you or your children can make others ill is not a good idea. Regarding ''contagious'' illnesses, many school systems have a ""''fever'' rule."" Any child who is out sick must be ''fever''-free for at least 24 hours before returning to school. This rule is designed to keep those with contagious illnesses away from others, and it is likely a good way to ensure that kids with the ''flu'', ''strep throat'"", or other serious infections don't spread the germs to others. Applying the ""'fever'"" rule will only work in certain situations, however. What about infections that may easily spread to others but don't necessarily cause a fever? Contagious conditions that don't cause fever include""""Instead of just considering fever, it's prudent to consider your symptoms and if you're unsure, err on the side of sparing your coworkers and call in sick or work from home. Remember that some people (who could be your coworkers), such as those undergoing ""'chemotherapy'' for ''cancer'', those who have chronic conditions, and ''pregnant'' women may be particularly vulnerable to complications if they catch your illness.'   the common cold, pinkeye, earache, and gastroenteritis."
What are non-contagious conditions that might mean you can't work?,"'Other kinds of conditions can also keep you home from work. ''Back pain'', recovery from surgery, debilitating ''migraines'', and broken bones may sometimes simply be associated with too much ''pain'' for you to work effectively, or the medications you take to control the ''pain'' could impair your work performance. The nature of your job also dictates what kind of medical conditions must keep you home. A desk worker may be able to work just fine while on crutches, but a lifeguard cannot.'""Putting yourself or your work product at risk is another consideration. Even if your condition isn't contagious, you should think about staying home if the ""'pain'' medications make you too drowsy to work effectively or if your limited mobility will pose a safety risk working with machinery. Or perhaps your lack of concentration could cause you to make a costly and/or damaging mistake for your company.'  "
How do I know when to keep my sick child home from school?,"""Overall, you and your child's symptoms are the biggest clue as to whether you or they should be staying home. The following symptoms are likely to be associated with a contagious illness and are probably a clue that you or they should stay home.

Introduction to sudden cardiac arrest,"""A natural disaster hits, the power goes off and the lights go out. It's a common scene that plays out during hurricane and tornado seasons, and it's very similar in trying to explain ""'sudden cardiac arrest''. The ''heart'"" sustains an insult, the electricity is short circuited, the heart can't pump, and the body dies.""'The heart is an electrical pump, where the electricity is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells in the upper chamber, or ''atrium'', of the heart. This electrical spark is carried through pathways in the heart so that all the muscle cells contract at once and produce a heart beat. This pumps blood through the heart valves and into all the organs of the body so that they can do their work.'""This mechanism can break down in a variety of ways, but the final pathway in sudden death is the same: the electrical system is irritated and fails to produce electrical activity that causes the heart to beat. The heart muscle can't supply blood to the body, particularly the brain, and the body dies. Ventricular ""'fibrillation'' (V Fib) is the most common reason for sudden death in patients. Without a coordinated electrical signal, the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles) stop beating and instead, jiggle like Jello. Ventricular Fibrillation is treated with electrical ''shock'', but for it to be effective, the shock usually needs to happen within less than four to six minutes, not only for it to be effective, but also to minimize ''brain damage'' from lack of blood and oxygen supply. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) are commonly available in public places to allow almost anybody to treat sudden death. Less commonly, the heart can just stop beating. The absence of a heart beat is known as asystole (asystole: a=no + systole=beat).'  "
What are the causes of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Sudden death is most often caused by ''heart disease''. When blood vessels narrow, the heart muscle can become irritated because of lack of blood supply. In ''heart attack'' (''acute myocardial infarction''), a blood vessel becomes completely blocked by a ''blood clot'', and there is enough irritability of the muscle to cause ventricular fibrillation. In fact, the reason many people with ''chest pain'' are admitted to the hospital is to monitor their heart rate and rhythm for signs that might lead to ventricular fibrillation. Sudden death may also be the first sign or symptom of ''heart disease''.''Congestive heart failure'' and heart valve problems, like ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the ''aortic valve'') also increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Cardiomyopathy'' is a broad category of ''heart disease'"" where the heart muscle does not contract properly for whatever reason. Often it is ischemic, where part of the heart muscle doesn't get an adequate blood supply for a prolonged period of time and no longer can efficiently pump blood. People whose ejection fractions (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each heart beat) is less than 30% are at greater risk for sudden death (a normal ejection fraction is above 50%). In some people, ""'cardiomyopathy'' may develop in the absence of ischemic heart disease.''Inflammation of the heart muscle, known as ''myocarditis'' (myo=muscle + card=heart + itis= inflammation), can also cause rhythm disturbances. Diseases like ''sarcoidosis'', ''amyloidosis'', and infections can cause inflammation of the heart muscle. ''Some people are born with electrical conducting systems that are faulty, which place them at higher risk for rhythm disturbances. Some are due to the wiring, or electrical conduction system, like ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'', while others are due to the structural basic structural problems within the heart, like ''Marfan syndrome''.''Pulmonary embolus or a ''blood clot'"" to the lung, can also cause sudden death. Clots form in the leg or arm and may break off and flow to the lung where they decrease the lung's ability to get oxygen from the air to the body. Risk factors for ""'blood clots'' include surgery, prolonged immobilization (for example, hospitalization, long car rides or plane trips), ''trauma'', or certain diseases like ''cancer''.''Blunt chest trauma, such is in a motor vehicle accident, may result in ventricular fibrillation. (please see commotio cordis below)' "
What about sudden cardiac arrest in the young?,"'In younger people, sudden death is a rare event, but since it often involves people involved in athletics, cases are often reported in the press. The most common cause is ''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'' (hypertrophy=to grow abnormally large + cardio=heart + myopathy = diseased muscle). This disease is often hereditary, and the walls of the ventricle are larger than they should be. This makes the pumping chamber of the heart smaller, and the heart has to work harder to pump blood out of the heart. As well, the thickened muscle narrows the space for the blood to flow through the aortic valve and to the rest of the body. During ''exercise'', this decreased blood flow can irritate the heart muscle itself and cause ventricular fibrillation, collapse, and sudden death.''Anomalous coronary arteries can also cause sudden death in the young. The heart is a muscle itself, and like any muscle, it needs blood supply to provide oxygen for it to work. Normally, the coronary arteries lie on the surface of the heart. Anomalous arteries dive into the heart muscle itself and may be occluded when the heart muscle that surrounds the abnormally placed artery squeezes aggressively, as with ''exercise'', shutting off blood supply to part of the heart. This irritates the electrical system and can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.''The pre-participation athletic physical examination is a useful tool to screen children andadolescents for their risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Commotio cordis is a situation in which the heart stops when the chest is hit by an object. News stories occasionally report of baseball players who are hit in the chest by a ball and collapse because their heart stops beating. The heart sits behind the breastbone, and the electrical system can be short circuited when a direct blow is sustained. ' "
What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Cardiac arrest symptoms and signs are not subtle:'   The heart stops beating and blood is not supplied to the body.  Almost immediate loss of consciousness occurs, and the affected person will not be able to be aroused. 
	 The person will fall or slump over.  No pulse will is felt (palpable). There will be no signs of breathing."
How is sudden cardiac arrest diagnosed?,'Sudden cardiac arrest is an unexpected death in a person who had no known previous diagnosis of a fatal disease or condition. The person may or may not have heart disease.' 
What is the treatment for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The vast majority of people whose heart stops beating unexpectedly have ventricular fibrillation. The definitive treatment for this is ''defibrillation'' using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm. With technological advances, AEDs are now a routine sight wherever people congregate.''Communities which institute public CPR education, use of AEDs, and rapid activation of 911 emergency medical services have dramatically increased survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, because the brain is so sensitive to the lack of oxygen and blood flow, unless treatment occurs within four to six minutes, there is a high risk of some permanent brain damage.''Should the patient survive to be transported to the hospital, the reason for collapse and sudden death will need to be diagnosed. Regardless, the ABCs of resuscitation will be re-evaluated. ''A''irway, ''B''reathing, and ''C''irculation (heart beat and ''blood pressure'') will be supported, and admission to an intensive care unit is most likely.''Diagnostic tests may include repeated electrocardiograms (EKGs), ''echocardiogram'' (ultrasounds of the heart), and ''cardiac catheterization'' and electrophysiologic studies, in which the electrical pathways of the heart are mapped.''Recent research involving the treatment of survivors of cardiac arrest suggests that prompt institution of ''hypothermia'' (cooling of the body) may prevent or lessen the degree of ''brain injury''. ''Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest are often candidates for ''implantable cardiac defibrillators''.' "
Can sudden cardiac arrest be prevented?,"'Death is best treated by ''prevention''. Most sudden death is associated with heart disease, so the at-risk population remains males older than 40 years of age who smoke, have ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes'' (the risk factors for heart attack). Other risks include ''syncope'' (''fainting'' or loss of consciousness) and known heart disease.'""Syncope, or loss of consciousness, is a significant risk factor for sudden death. While some reasons for passing out are benign, there is always a concern that the reason was an abnormal heart rhythm that subsequently spontaneously corrected. The fear is that the next episode will be a sudden cardiac arrest. Depending on the healthcare provider's suspicion based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ""'EKG'', the healthcare practitioner may recommend inpatient or outpatient heart monitoring to try to find a clue as to whether the passing out was due to a deadly heart rhythm. Unfortunately, the potentially suspect rhythm may not recur and depending on the situation, prolonged outpatient monitoring lasting weeks and months may be necessary. Use of electrophysiologic testing may help identify high risk patients (the electrical pathways are mapped using techniques similar to heart catheterization).''In people with symptoms of ''chest pain'', aside from making the diagnosis, monitoring both the heart rate and rhythm are emphasized. The purpose of watching people with chest ''pain'' in a hospital setting is to prevent sudden cardiac arrest.''Using implantable defibrillators in high risk patients, especially those with markedly decreased ejection fractions can reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. These devices are placed under the skin in the chest wall and have wires that are attached to the heart itself. When they detect ventricular fibrillation, a shock is automatically delivered to the heart, restoring a heart beat and averting sudden death.' "
What is the prognosis for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The frequency of sudden cardiac arrest is related to the frequency of ''coronary artery disease''. If public health initiatives work to decrease risk the factors for heart disease, the risk for sudden death should decrease as well. ''In the adolescent population, increased awareness of hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' and appropriate screening may decrease the frequency of sudden death.''Public education and widespread availability of AEDs will increase survival.' "
Introduction to Arrhythmia,"'An irregular heartbeat is an arrhythmia (also called dysrhythmia). ''Heart'"" rates can also be irregular. A normal heart rate is 50 to 100 beats per minute. Arrhythmias and abnormal heart rates don't necessarily occur together. Arrhythmias can occur with a normal heart rate, or with heart rates that are slow (called bradyarrhythmias -- less than 50 beats per minute). Arrhythmias can also occur with rapid heart rates (called tachyarrhythmias -- faster than 100 beats per minute). In the United States, more than 850,000 people are hospitalized for an arrhythmia each year."" "
What causes an arrhythmia?,"'Arrhythmias may be caused by many different factors, including:'   Coronary artery disease. Electrolyte imbalances in your blood (such as sodium or potassium). Changes in your heart muscle. Injury from a heart attack. Healing process after heart surgery. Irregular heart rhythms can also occur in ""normal, healthy"" hearts."
What are the types of arrhythmias?,"'The types of arrhythmias include:'   Premature atrial contractions. These are early extra beats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). They are harmless and do not require treatment. Premature ventricular contractions(PVCs). These are among the most common arrhythmias and occur in people with and without heart disease. This is the skipped heartbeat we all occasionally experience. In some people, it can be related to stress, too much caffeine or nicotine, or too much exercise. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. People who have a lot of PVCs, and/or symptoms associated with them, should be evaluated by a heart doctor. However, in most people, PVCs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment. Atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria, the upper chambers of the heart, to contract abnormally. Atrial flutter. This is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. Atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. This arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often converts to atrial fibrillation. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, originating from above the ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly. There are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below). Accessory pathway tachycardias. A rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. The impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. This allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly, causing the heart to beat unusually fast. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. A rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In many cases, it can be terminated using a simple maneuvers, such as breathing in and bearing down, and others performed by a trained medical professional. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm. Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). A rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. The rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood; therefore, less blood is able to pump through the body. This can be a serious arrhythmia, especially in people with heart disease, and may be associated with more symptoms. A heart doctor should evaluate this arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation. An erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. The ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation as soon as possible. Long QT syndrome. The QT interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover, or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. When the QT interval is longer than normal, it increases the risk for ""torsade de pointes,"" a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. Long QT syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. It can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, pacemaker, electrical cardioversion, defibrillation, implanted cardioverter/defibrillator, or ablation therapy. Bradyarrhythmias. These are slow heart rhythms, which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. Examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block. Sinus node dysfunction. A slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal SA (sinus) node. Significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker. Heart block. A delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. The level of the block or delay may occur in the AV node or HIS-Purkinje system. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. If serious, heart block is treated with a pacemaker."
What are the symptoms of arrhythmias?,"'An arrhythmia can be silent and not cause any symptoms. A doctor can detect an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse or through an electrocardiogram (''ECG'').''When symptoms of an arrhythmia occur, they may include:'   Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heart beats, fluttering or ""flip-flops,"" or feeling that your heart is ""running away""). Pounding in your chest. Dizziness or feeling light-headed. Fainting. Shortness of breath. Chest discomfort. Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired)."
How are arrhythmias diagnosed?,'Tests used to diagnose an arrhythmia or determine its cause include:' Electrocardiogram Holter monitor Event monitor Stress test Echocardiogram Cardiac catheterization Electrophysiology study (EPS) Head-up tilt table test
How are arrhythmias treated?,"'Treatment depends on the type and seriousness of your arrhythmia. Some people with arrhythmias require no treatment. For others, treatments can include medication, making lifestyle changes, and undergoing surgical procedures.'  "
What Drugs Are Used to Treat Arrhythmias?,"'A variety of drugs are available to treat arrhythmias. These include:''Because everyone is different, it may take trials of several medications and doses to find the one that works best for you.' Antiarrhythmic drugs. These drugs control heart rate and include beta-blockers. Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. These drugs reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. These include warfarin (a ""blood thinner"") or aspirin. Another blood thinner called Pradaxa (dabigatran) was approved in 2010 to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation."
Lifestyle Changes Can Help Arrhythmias?," If you notice that your arrhythmia occurs more often with certain activities, you should avoid them. If you smoke, stop. Limit your intake of alcohol. Limit or stop using caffeine. Some people are sensitive to caffeine and may notice more symptoms when using caffeine products (such as tea, coffee, soft drinks, and some over-the-counter medications). Stay away from stimulants used in cough and cold medications. Some such medications contain ingredients that promote irregular heart rhythms. Read the label and ask your doctor or pharmacist what medication would be best for you."
What Is Electrical Cardioversion?,"'If drugs are not able to control a persistent irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), cardioversion may be required. After administration of a short-acting anesthesia, an electrical ''shock'' is delivered to your chest wall that synchronizes the heart and allows the normal rhythm to restart.' "
What is a pacemaker?,'A pacemaker is a device that sends small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to maintain a suitable heart rate. Pacemakers primarily prevent the heart from beating too slowly. The pacemaker has a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and leads (wires) that send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle. Newer pacemakers have many sophisticated features that are designed to help manage arrhythmias and optimize heart rate-related function as much as possible.' 
What is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)?,"'An ICD is a sophisticated device used primarily to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms. The ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. There are several ways the ICD can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. They include:' Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). When the heart beats too fast, a series of small electrical impulses may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. Cardioversion. A low energy shock may be delivered at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm. Defibrillation. When the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly, a higher energy shock may be delivered to the heart muscle to restore a normal rhythm. Anti-bradycardia pacing. Many ICDs provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much."
What Is Catheter Ablation?,"'During an ablation, high-frequency electrical energy is delivered through a catheter to a small area of tissue inside the heart that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy ""disconnects"" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm. Ablation is used to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Ablation may be combined with other procedures to achieve optimal treatment.' "
What Is Heart Surgery?,"'Heart surgery may be needed to correct heart disease that may be causing the arrhythmia. The Maze procedure is a type of surgery used to correct atrial fibrillation. During this procedure, a series (or ""maze"") of incisions are made in the right and left atria to confine the electrical impulses to defined pathways. Some people may require a pacemaker after this procedure.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Introduction to treating arrhythmias with ablation,"'Ablation is used to treat ''abnormal heart rhythms'', or arrhythmias. The type of ''arrhythmia'' and the presence of other ''heart disease'' will determine whether ablation can be performed surgically or non-surgically.''Non-surgical ablation'', used for many types of arrhythmias, is performed in a special lab called the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory. During this non-surgical procedure a catheter is inserted into a specific area of the ''heart''. A special machine directs energy through the catheter to small areas of the heart muscle that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy ""disconnects"" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm. It can also be used to disconnect the electrical pathway between the upper chambers (atria) and the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart.''Surgical ablation'' procedures used for treating ''atrial fibrillation'' can be ""minimally invasive"" or traditional ""open"" surgery and may be combined with other surgical therapies such as bypass surgery, valve repair, or valve replacement. Surgical ablation procedures include:' The Maze procedure. During this traditional open-heart surgical procedure, the surgeon makes small cuts in the heart to interrupt the conduction of abnormal impulses and to direct normal sinus impulses to travel to the atrioventricular node (AV node) as they normally should. When the heart heals, scar tissue forms and the abnormal electrical impulses are blocked from traveling through the heart. Minimally invasive surgical ablation. Unlike traditional heart surgery, there is no large chest wall incision and the heart is not stopped. These techniques utilize smaller incisions and endoscopes (small, lighted instruments that contain a camera). 
 The modified Maze procedure. The surgeon uses a special catheter to deliver energy that creates controlled lesions on the heart and ultimately scar tissue. This scar tissue blocks the abnormal electrical impulses from being conducted through the heart and promotes the normal conduction of impulses through the proper pathway. One of four energy sources may be used to create the scars: radiofrequency, microwave, laser, or cryothermy (cold temperatures). The modified Maze procedure involves a single incision in the left atrium."
Why do I need ablation therapy?,"'Doctors recommend ablation therapy to treat:''In addition to re-establishing a normal heart rhythm in people with certain arrhythmias, ablation therapy can help control the heart rate in people with rapid arrhythmias, and reduce the risk of ''blood clots'' and ''strokes''.'   Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter AV Nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) Accessory pathways Ventricular tachycardia"
How should I prepare for catheter ablation?,"""The ablation preparation may vary, depending on whether you're having surgical or nonsurgical ablation. These are general guidelines; your doctor or nurse will give you specific instructions.""'To prepare for ablation, there are several steps you should take. Among them:' Ask your doctor which medications you should stop taking and when to stop them. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain drugs (such as those that control your heart rate or blood thinners including aspirin products) one to five days before your procedure. If you are diabetic, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetic medications. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the procedure. If you must take medications, drink only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home."
What can I expect during catheter ablation?,"'During nonsurgical catheter ablation, the following things will occur:''The procedure usually takes about four to eight hours, but may take longer.' The procedure will take place in a special room called the EP (electrophysiology) lab. Before the test begins, a nurse will help you get ready. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an IV (intravenous) line in your hand or arm. This is so the doctors and nurses can give you medications and fluids through your vein during the procedure. You will be given a medication through your IV to help you relax. Depending on the type of ablation you have, you may or may not be awake during your procedure. If you are awake, you will be asked to report any symptoms, answer questions, or follow instructions given to you by your doctor. If you are uncomfortable or need anything, please let your nurse know. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. 
 After you become drowsy, your groin area will be shaved and your neck, upper chest, arm, and groin will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes will be placed to cover you from your neck to your feet. 
 The doctor will numb the insertion site by injecting a medication. You will feel an initial burning sensation, and then it will become numb. Then, several catheters (special wires that can pace the heart and record its electrical activity) will be inserted through a small incision into a large blood vessel(s) and/or artery (in your groin, neck, or arm) and advanced to your heart. If you are awake, it is important that you remain still and resist the temptation to raise your head to see what the doctor is doing while the catheters are being placed. 
 After the catheters are in place, the doctor will look at the monitor to assess your heart's conduction system. 
 Then, the doctor will perform the ablation procedure. 
 During traditional ablation, the doctor will use a pacemaker-like device to send electrical impulses to the heart to increase your heart rate. You may feel your heart beating faster or stronger when the pacemaker delivers the impulses. If your arrhythmia occurs during the procedure, the nurse will ask you how you are feeling. It is very important to tell the doctor or nurse the symptoms you feel. The doctor will then move the catheters around your heart to see which area(s) your arrhythmia is coming from. Once the doctor finds the area of your arrhythmia, energy is applied. You may feel some discomfort or a burning sensation in your chest, but you must stay quiet, keep very still, and avoid taking deep breaths. If you are feeling pain, ask your doctor or nurse to give you more medication. 
 During pulmonary vein ablation (for atrial fibrillation), the doctor delivers energy through a catheter to the area of the atria that connects to the pulmonary vein (ostia), producing a circular scar. The scar will then block any impulses firing from within the pulmonary veins, thus preventing atrial fibrillation from occurring. The process is repeated to all four pulmonary veins. In some cases, ablation may also be performed to other parts of the heart such as the subclavian veins and coronary sinus. The catheter is a special ""cool tip"" catheter. Fluid circulates through the catheter to help control the intensity of the temperature. 
 Once the ablation is complete, the electrophysiologist will use monitoring devices to observe the electrical signals in the heart to ensure that the abnormal heart rhythm was corrected. 
"
What happens after catheter ablation?,"'After your nonsurgical catheter ablation:''If you have any other questions, please ask your doctor or nurse. Ask your health care provider how often you will need to go for follow-up appointments.' The doctor will remove the catheters from your groin and apply pressure to the site to prevent bleeding. You will be on bed rest for one to six hours. Keep your legs as still as possible during this time to prevent bleeding. 
 After your procedure, you may be admitted to the hospital. During your recovery, a special monitor, called telemetry, will be used to follow your heart rate and rhythm. Telemetry consists of a small box connected by wires to your chest with sticky electrode patches. The box allows your heart rhythm to be displayed on several monitors on the nursing unit. The nurses will be able to observe your heart rate and rhythm. In most cases, you will be able to go home the next day after the catheter ablation procedure but in some cases you may be able to go home the same day of the procedure. 
 You and your family will receive the results of the procedure afterwards. Your doctor will also discuss when you can resume activities and how often you will need to visit your doctor. 
 Temporarily, many individuals experience heart palpitations on and off for a few weeks after the procedure. Sometimes you may also feel as if your abnormal heart rhythm is returning, but then it stops. These sensations are normal and you should not be alarmed. When these symptoms occur during your recovery, it is important to document them by calling your doctor or nurse as directed. Also call your doctor or nurse if you feel as if your abnormal heart rhythm has recurred. 
 You may be required to take medications for a certain period of time after your procedure. 
"
How should I care for the wound site?,"'You will have a small dressing on your ''wound''. It may be removed the next day. Keep the area clean and dry.''Call your doctor if you notice any redness, swelling, or drainage at the incision site.' "
What can I expect during surgical ablation?,"'During surgical ablation, you can expect the following:' General anesthesia (the patient is asleep) or local anesthesia with sedation (the patient is awake but relaxed and pain-free) may be used, depending on the individual case. During minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon views the outer surface of the heart using an endoscope. Specialized instruments are used to locate the areas needing ablation and to create the lines of conduction block. Unlike traditional heart surgery, there is no large chest wall incision, and the heart is not stopped. The Maze procedure requires an incision along the sternum (breast bone). The incision may be traditional (about 6 to 8 inches long), or in some cases, minimally invasive (about 3 to 5 inches long). The heart is stopped during this procedure. A heart-lung machine oxygenates the blood and circulates it throughout the body during surgery. The modified Maze procedure involves using one of four different energy sources to create the lines of conduction block (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, or cryothermy). The energy probe of choice is inserted, and under direct vision, used to create the lesion lines. As in the classic Maze procedure, these lesions create lines of conduction block that interrupt the abnormal impulses and restore the normal sinus rhythm. This procedure is used primarily in patients who have atrial fibrillation and other indications for surgery."
What happens after surgical ablation?,"'If your ablation surgery was combined with valve, bypass, or another surgical procedure, your post-procedure care may be different.''After surgical ablation:''Medications after surgery may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' The patient is usually transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring for about one to two days after the surgery. When the patient's condition is stable, he or she is transferred to a regular nursing unit (called a telemetry unit). The monitoring during recovery includes heart, blood pressure, and blood oxygen monitoring and frequent checks of vital signs and other parameters, such as heart sounds. Most patients stay in the hospital about 5 to 7 days after the procedure, depending on their rate of recovery. Patients who had minimally invasive surgery may be able to go home 2 to 3 days after surgery. Your health care team will follow your progress and help you recover as quickly as possible. Full recovery from surgery takes about 6 to 8 weeks. Most patients are able to drive in about 3 to 8 weeks after surgery. Your health care team will provide specific guidelines for your recovery and return to work, including specific instructions on activity, incision care, and general health after the surgery. Many patients may experience skipped heartbeats or short episodes of atrial fibrillation during the first three months after the procedure. This is common due to inflammation (swelling) of the heart tissue and is treated with medications. After the heart has healed, these abnormal heartbeats should subside. A small number of patients require a pacemaker after surgery due to an underlying abnormal rhythm which previously was undetected. Anticoagulants (blood thinners), such as Coumadin, to prevent blood clots. Antiarrhythmic medication to control abnormal heartbeats. Diuretics to reduce fluid retention. Your doctor will monitor your recovery and determine when or if these medications can be discontinued."
What is arsenic?,"'Arsenic is a grey-appearing chemical element (atomic number 33, symbol As in the periodic table) also termed a metalloid. Arsenic can exist in a metallic state in three forms (yellow, black, and gray; with gray predominating) and in ionic forms. Arsenic is considered to be a heavy metal, and arsenic toxicity shares some features with poisonings by other heavy metals. Historically, arsenic has been used as a medicinal agent, a pigment, a pesticide, and an agent with intent to harm (use with criminal intent). Up until 2003, arsenic (in the form of chromated copper arsenate) was used in the US as a treatment to prevent insect infestation of wood used in building. In 2003 the use of this compound was banned by the US Environmental Protection Agency. ''Arsenic is mixed with copper or lead to strengthen alloys containing these materials. Arsenic and some of its compounds react with proteins, mainly the thiol portions, and uncouples the process of oxidative phosphorylation, thus inactivating most cellular functions. Consequently, arsenic and some of the substances it combines with are deadly poisons to most biologic systems, except for a few bacterial species. Arsenic is used in making insecticides and weed killers. Arsenic is also thought to be carcinogenic, meaning that it has the potential to cause ''cancer''. ''Arsenic can be found as a contaminant in food and water sources. Shellfish and other seafood, as well as fruits, vegetables, and rice; are the foods most commonly contaminated. Arsenic poisoning typically occurs as a result of industrial exposure, from contaminated wine or illegally distilled spirits, or in cases of malicious intent. ' "
What is inorganic arsenic?,"'Inorganic arsenic is metallic or a metalloid element that forms a number of poisonous compounds. In industry, it can be found in a gaseous form termed arsine ''gas'' that is very toxic when inhaled. Inorganic arsenic is found in nature at low levels mostly compounded with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. These are called inorganic arsenic compounds. Inorganic arsenic compounds are much more poisonous to most biologic systems (animals, plants, humans) than organic arsenic (see below). Inorganic arsenic occurs in nature in the soil, copper and lead ore deposits, and water, but usually in low concentrations. However, it can become more concentrated when industrial processes use it to make wood preservatives, metal compounds, or organic arsenic-containing compounds such as insecticides, weed killers, and other compounds. If such compounds are burned, inorganic arsenic can be released into the air and later settle on the ground or in water and either remain in the inorganic form or combine with organic material.' "
What is organic arsenic?,"'Organic arsenic is any compound that is made from a chemical combination of the element arsenic with any organic compound (compounds containing a large amount of carbon). These are often termed arsenical organic compounds. Most frequently organic arsenic is a component used in making insecticides and weed killers and other compounds. Organic arsenic usually is not poisonous to humans but may be poisonous to humans in high concentrations. In general, organic arsenic is usually far less poisonous than inorganic arsenic. ' "
What are the symptoms of arsenic poisoning?,"'People can be exposed to arsenic by inhaling it, by consuming contaminated foods, water, or ''beverages'', or by skin contact. We are normally exposed to trace amounts of arsenic in the air and water, and in foods. People may be exposed to higher levels if they live near industrial areas that currently or formerly contained arsenic compounds. Areas with known high concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water are also associated with greater exposure. ''Acute or immediate symptoms of a toxic level of exposure to arsenic may include the following: ''Long-term exposures to arsenic lower than toxic levels can lead to skin changes (darkening or discoloration, redness, swelling and hyperkeratosis (skin ''bumps'' that resemble ''corns'' or ''warts'""). Whitish lines (Mees' lines) may appear in the fingernails. Both sensory and motor nerve defects can develop. Additionally,  ""'liver'' and kidney function may be affected. ''Arsenic exposure over the long-term has also been associated with the development of certain ''cancers'', and arsenic has been classified as a carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Studies of people in parts of Southeast Asia and South America where there has been a high level of arsenic in the drinking water have reported an increased risk of developing cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung, and skin. Organic arsenic compounds are not as toxic as inorganic compounds and are not believed to be linked to ''cancer''. '   Vomiting  Abdominal pain  Diarrhea  Dark urine (termed black water urine)  Dehydration  Cardiac problems  Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)  Vertigo  Delirium  Shock  Death "
How is arsenic poisoning diagnosed?,"'The history of the patient is very important as exposures are most often from industrial accidents so other people (coworkers, rescue personnel) may be exposed and not realize they may have some risk also. People exposed to toxic levels of arsenic may have breath and urine that smells like ''garlic'' as a clue to their diagnosis. Most doctors that suspect arsenic (or other metal or metalloid poisonings) will request lab studies such as blood cell counts andserum ''electrolytes'' such as calcium and magnesium; if there is evidence of hemolysis (blood cell destruction), a type and screening for a potential ''blood transfusion'' is done.''\xa0There are rapid urine ""spot"" tests available to diagnose elevated levels of arsenic, but they usually don\'t distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic. The patient\'s blood and urine will be sent for analysis for arsenic; a result of > 50 micrograms/L is considered elevated, but acute toxic exposures may result in levels 5 to 100 times or more than those which are considered ""elevated."" A speciation test (determines levels of inorganic versus organic arsenic) is required in all cases in which total urine arsenic is elevated since inorganic arsenic is so toxic. Electrocardiograms (''ECG'', ''EKG'') and nerve conduction tests are often done in any type of suspected arsenic exposure. Tests for other toxins or toxic overdoses (for example, ''Tylenol'' ingestion) may also be done. '  "
How is arsenic poisoning treated?,"'Acute toxic inorganic arsenic exposure and arsine ''gas'"" exposure can rapidly result in death, and there are only a few ways to possibly save the patient's life. ""'Hemodialysis'' can remove arsenic from the bloodstream, but only before it binds to the tissues so there is only a short time window for this treatment to work. Similarly, arsine binds to and causes rapid destruction of red blood cells, so blood transfusions and exchange transfusions may help the patient. In addition, if the arsenic was ingested, stomach or bowel irrigation may be attempted, but there is no good data to indicate these will be successful. Consultation with a nephrologist and a toxicologist as soon as possible is recommended; other consultants may need to be called (hematologist, psychiatrist, or others).''Chelation therapy (the use of ''drugs'' that selectively bind and effectively inactivate substances) is usually begun quickly through an intravenous line. The drug and the bound arsenic is then excreted through the urine. The chelation drug of choice is Dimercaprol (also termed BAL in oil); ''Succimer'' (DMSA) has also been used successfully, and Dimerval (DMPS) may also work as a chelator, but it is not readily available in the US.'  "
What is the prognosis (outcome) of arsenic poisoning?,"'If the patient survives an acute toxic exposure, most will develop some degree of nerve damage to the peripheral nerves (sensory and motor disturbances); many survivors may have cardiac, ''liver'', renal, and skin problems; the prognosis is fair to poor. Chronic poisoning and organic arsenic exposure have better outcomes with fewer and less severe problems. ' "
"In what foods (rice), products (apple juice), or liquids (water) is arsenic found, where it is used, and what are safe limits?","'People may be exposed through work in a metal foundry, mining, glass production, the semiconductor industry, in criminal attempts at murder by poisoning, ''suicide'' attempts, and as a biological warfare agent.''Recent examples of concerns about arsenic have surfaced because of its presence in apple juice. In most studies, various sources of apple juice tested by government and consumer labs have found that most (over 95% tested) contain a very small amount of arsenic (less than 10 parts per billion) and are safe to drink (in contrast to a TV show that raised alarms about consuming apple juice). However, the FDA qualified their findings by indicating in July 2013, new standards would apply and any juice that contained 10 or more parts per billion (the same level set for safe groundwater) would not be permitted to be sold in the US. This is lower than the previous approved level of less than 23 parts per billion approved in 2008. Nonetheless, other groups suggest that only juice containing less than 3 parts per billion be FDA approved.''Two other sources of arsenic, especially of some concern for children, is arsenic in groundwater and subsequently, in rice that is grown in such groundwater. Rice is a common food for children but to date, there are no regulations about the levels of arsenic that are considered safe for consumption. The FDA and the EPA are currently collecting data to make a recommendation about safe levels but many groups are pushing the FDA to act soon. The groups claim some private laboratories have detected that a single adult serving of some commercially available rice can give about 1.5 times the amount of permissible arsenic in one liter of water (under 10 parts per billion), so action on permissible arsenic levels should be done quickly. In 2013, the CDC recommends only about 2 cups of cooked rice per individual (adult) per week.'   Arsenic has been found to contaminate such common items as wine, glues, and pigments. Arsenic is commonly found in many foods both in its relatively nontoxic organic form, and also in the more toxic inorganic form. Consequently, such foods need to be tested for both inorganic and organic arsenic levels. Arsenic has been reported in milk and dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, and cereal. Arsenic is also often found in rice, representing a potentially serious source of exposure in certain at-risk populations (especially children). Many water sources in the world have high levels of arsenic in them, both due to normal arsenic leaching out of the ground and from mining and industrial waste."
What Are Arteriovenous Malformations?,"'Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects of the circulatory system that are generally believed to arise during embryonic or ''fetal development'' or soon after birth. They are comprised of snarled tangles of arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the ''heart'"" to the body's cells; veins return oxygen-depleted blood to the ""'lungs'' and heart. The absence of capillaries -- small blood vessels that connect arteries to veins -- creates a short-cut for blood to pass directly from arteries to veins.  The presence of an ''AVM'' disrupts this vital cyclical process. Although AVMs can develop in many different sites, those located in the brain or spinal cord -- the two parts of the central nervous system -- can have especially widespread effects on the body.''AVMs of the brain or spinal cord (neurological AVMs) are believed to affect approximately 300,000 Americans. They occur in males and females of all racial or ethnic backgrounds at roughly equal rates. ' "
What Are the Symptoms of AVMs?,"'Most people with neurological AVMs experience few, if any, significant symptoms, and the malformations tend to be discovered only incidentally, usually either at ''autopsy'' or during treatment for an unrelated disorder. But for about 12 percent of the affected population (about 36,000 of the estimated 300,000 Americans with AVMs), these abnormalities cause symptoms that vary greatly in severity. For a small fraction of the individuals within this group, such symptoms are severe enough to become debilitating or even life-threatening. Each year about 1 percent of those with AVMs will die as a direct result of the AVM.''Seizures'' and ''headaches'' are the most generalized symptoms of AVMs, but no particular type of ''seizure'' or ''headache'' pattern has been identified. ''Seizures'"" can be partial or total, involving a loss of control over movement, convulsions, or a change in a person's level of consciousness. ""'Headaches'' can vary greatly in frequency, duration, and intensity, sometimes becoming as severe as ''migraines''. Sometimes a ''headache'' consistently affecting one side of the head may be closely linked to the site of an AVM. More frequently, however, the location of the ''pain'' is not specific to the lesion and may encompass most of the head.''AVMs also can cause a wide range of more specific neurological symptoms that vary from person to person, depending primarily upon the location of the AVM. Such symptoms may include muscle ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'' in one part of the body; a loss of coordination (''ataxia'') that can lead to such problems as gait disturbances; apraxia, or difficulties carrying out tasks that require planning; ''dizziness''; visual disturbances such as a loss of part of the visual field; an inability to control eye movement; papilledema (swelling of a part of the ''optic nerve'' known as the optic disk); various problems using or understanding language (''aphasia''); abnormal sensations such as numbness, tingling, or spontaneous ''pain'' (paresthesia or dysesthesia); memory deficits; and mental ''confusion'', ''hallucinations'', or ''dementia''. Researchers have recently uncovered evidence that AVMs may also cause subtle learning or behavioral disorders in some people during their childhood or adolescence, long before more obvious symptoms become evident.''One of the more distinctive signs indicating the presence of an AVM is an auditory phenomenon called a bruit, coined from the French word meaning noise. (A sign is a physical effect observable by a physician, but not by a patient.) Doctors use this term to describe the rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM. The sound is similar to that made by a torrent of water rushing through a narrow pipe. A bruit can sometimes become a symptom when it is especially severe. When audible to individuals, the bruit may compromise ''hearing'', disturb ''sleep'', or cause significant psychological distress.''Symptoms caused by AVMs can appear at any age, but because these abnormalities tend to result from a slow buildup of neurological damage over time they are most often noticed when people are in their twenties, thirties, or forties. If AVMs do not become symptomatic by the time people reach their late forties or early fifties, they tend to remain stable and rarely produce symptoms. In women, ''pregnancy'' sometimes causes a sudden onset or worsening of symptoms, due to accompanying cardiovascular changes, especially increases in blood volume and ''blood pressure''.''In contrast to the vast majority of neurological AVMs, one especially severe type causes symptoms to appear at, or very soon after, birth. Called a vein of Galen defect after the major blood vessel involved, this lesion is located deep inside the brain. It is frequently associated with ''hydrocephalus'' (an accumulation of fluid within certain spaces in the brain, often with visible enlargement of the head), swollen veins visible on the ''scalp'', seizures, failure to thrive, and ''congestive heart failure''. Children born with this condition who survive past infancy often remain developmentally impaired.'  "
How do AVMs Damage the Brain and Spinal Cord?,"'AVMs become symptomatic only when the damage they cause to the brain or spinal cord reaches a critical level. This is one of the reasons why a relatively small fraction of people with these lesions experiences significant health problems related to the condition. AVMs damage the brain or spinal cord through three basic mechanisms: by reducing the amount of oxygen reaching neurological tissues; by causing bleeding (hemorrhage) into surrounding tissues; and by compressing or displacing parts of the brain or spinal cord.''AVMs compromise oxygen delivery to the brain or spinal cord by altering normal patterns of blood flow. Arteries and veins are normally interconnected by a series of progressively smaller blood vessels that control and slow the rate of blood flow. Oxygen delivery to surrounding tissues takes place through the thin, porous walls of the smallest of these interconnecting vessels, known as capillaries, where the blood flows most slowly. The arteries and veins that make up AVMs, however, lack this intervening capillary network. Instead, arteries dump blood directly into veins through a passageway called a fistula. The flow rate is uncontrolled and extremely rapid -- too rapid to allow oxygen to be dispersed to surrounding tissues. When starved of normal amounts of oxygen, the cells that make up these tissues begin to deteriorate, sometimes dying off completely.''This abnormally rapid rate of blood flow frequently causes blood pressure inside the vessels located in the central portion of an AVM directly adjacent to the fistula—an area doctors refer to as the nidus, from the Latin word for nest -- to rise to dangerously high levels. The arteries feeding blood into the AVM often become swollen and distorted; the veins that drain blood away from it often become abnormally constricted (a condition called stenosis). Moreover, the walls of the involved arteries and veins are often abnormally thin and weak. Aneurysms -- balloon-like bulges in blood vessel walls that are susceptible to rupture -- may develop in association with approximately half of all neurological AVMs due to this structural weakness.''Bleeding can result from this combination of high internal pressure and vessel wall weakness. Such hemorrhages are often microscopic in size, causing limited damage and few significant symptoms. Even many nonsymptomatic AVMs show evidence of past bleeding. But massive hemorrhages can occur if the physical stresses caused by extremely ''high blood pressure'', rapid blood flow rates, and vessel wall weakness are great enough. If a large enough volume of blood escapes from a ruptured AVM into the surrounding brain, the result can be a catastrophic ''stroke''. AVMs account for approximately 2 percent of all hemorrhagic ''strokes'' that occur each year.''Even in the absence of bleeding or significant oxygen depletion, large AVMs can damage the brain or spinal cord simply by their presence. They can range in size from a fraction of an inch to more than 2.5 inches in diameter, depending on the number and size of the blood vessels making up the lesion. The larger the lesion, the greater the amount of pressure it exerts on surrounding brain or spinal cord structures. The largest lesions may compress several inches of the spinal cord or distort the shape of an entire hemisphere of the brain. Such massive AVMs can constrict the flow of cerebrospinal fluid - a clear liquid that normally nourishes and protects the brain and spinal cord -- by distorting or closing the passageways and open chambers (ventricles) inside the brain that allow this fluid to circulate freely. As cerebrospinal fluid accumulates, ''hydrocephalus'' results. This fluid buildup further increases the amount of pressure on fragile neurological structures, adding to the damage caused by the AVM itself.' "
Where Do Neurological AVMs Tend to Form?,"'AVMs can form virtually anywhere in the brain or spinal cord -- wherever arteries and veins exist. Some are formed from blood vessels located in the dura mater or in the pia mater, the outermost and innermost, respectively, of the three membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. (The third membrane, called the arachnoid, lacks blood vessels.) AVMs affecting the spinal cord are of two types, AVMs of the dura mater, which affect the function of the spinal cord by transmitting excess pressure to the venous system of the spinal cord, and AVMs of the spinal cord itself, which affect the function of the spinal cord by hemorrhage, by reducing blood flow to the spinal cord, or by causing excess venous pressure. Spinal AVMs frequently cause attacks of sudden, severe ''back pain'', often concentrated at the roots of nerve fibers where they exit the vertebrae; the pain is similar to that caused by a slipped disk. These lesions also can cause sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, or paralysis in the parts of the body served by the spinal cord or the damaged nerve fibers. ''Spinal cord injury'' by the AVM by either of the mechanisms described above can lead to degeneration of the nerve fibers within the spinal cord below the level of the lesion, causing widespread paralysis in parts of the body controlled by those nerve fibers.''Dural and pial AVMs can appear anywhere on the surface of the brain. Those located on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres -- the uppermost portions of the brain—exert pressure on the cerebral cortex, the brain\'s ""''gray matter''."" Depending on their location, these AVMs may damage portions of the cerebral cortex involved with thinking, speaking, understanding language, hearing, taste, touch, or initiating and controlling voluntary movements. AVMs located on the frontal lobe close to the optic nerve or on the occipital lobe, the rear portion of the cerebrum where images are processed, may cause a variety of visual disturbances.''AVMs also can form from blood vessels located deep inside the interior of the cerebrum. These AVMs may compromise the functions of three vital structures: the thalamus, which transmits nerve signals between the spinal cord and upper regions of the brain; the basal ganglia surrounding the thalamus, which coordinate complex movements; and the hippocampus, which plays a major role in memory.''AVMs can affect other parts of the brain besides the cerebrum. The hindbrain is formed from two major structures: the cerebellum, which is nestled under the rear portion of the cerebrum, and the brainstem, which serves as the ''bridge'' linking the upper portions of the brain with the spinal cord. These structures control finely coordinated movements, maintain balance, and regulate some functions of internal organs, including those of the heart and lungs. AVM damage to these parts of the hindbrain can result in ''dizziness'', giddiness, ''vomiting'', a loss of the ability to coordinate complex movements such as ''walking'', or uncontrollable muscle ''tremors''.' "
What Are the Health Consequences of AVMs?,"'The greatest potential danger posed by AVMs is hemorrhage. Researchers believe that each year between 2 and 4 percent of all AVMs hemorrhage. Most episodes of bleeding remain undetected at the time they occur because they are not severe enough to cause significant neurological damage. But massive, even fatal, bleeding episodes do occur. The present state of knowledge does not permit doctors to predict whether or not any particular person with an AVM will suffer an extensive hemorrhage. The lesions can remain stable or can suddenly begin to grow. In a few cases, they have been observed to regress spontaneously. Whenever an AVM is detected, the individual should be carefully and consistently monitored for any signs of instability that may indicate an increased risk of hemorrhage.''A few physical characteristics appear to indicate a greater-than-usual likelihood of clinically significant hemorrhage. Smaller AVMs have a greater likelihood of bleeding than do larger ones. Impaired drainage by unusually narrow or deeply situated veins also increases the chances of hemorrhage. Pregnancy also appears to increase the likelihood of clinically significant hemorrhage, mainly because of increases in blood pressure and blood volume. Finally, AVMs that have hemorrhaged once are about nine times more likely to bleed again during the first year after the initial hemorrhage than are lesions that have never bled.''The damaging effects of a hemorrhage are related to lesion location. Bleeding from AVMs located deep inside the interior tissues, or parenchyma, of the brain typically causes more severe neurological damage than does hemorrhage by lesions that have formed in the dural or pial membranes or on the surface of the brain or spinal cord. (Deeply located bleeding is usually referred to as an intracerebral or parenchymal hemorrhage; bleeding within the membranes or on the surface of the brain is known as subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage.) Thus, location is an important factor to consider when weighing the relative risks of surgical versus non-surgical treatment of AVMs.'  "
What Other Types of Vascular Lesions Affect The Central Nervous System?,"'Besides AVMs, three other main types of vascular lesion can arise in the brain or spinal cord: cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectases, and venous malformations. These lesions may form virtually anywhere within the central nervous system, but unlike AVMs, they are not caused by high-velocity blood flow from arteries into veins. In contrast, cavernous malformations, telangiectases, and venous malformations are all low-flow lesions. Instead of a combination of arteries and veins, each one involves only one type of blood vessel. These lesions are less unstable than AVMs and do not pose the same relatively high risk of significant hemorrhage. In general, low-flow lesions tend to cause fewer troubling neurological symptoms and require less aggressive treatment than do AVMs.' Cavernous malformations. These lesions are formed from groups of tightly packed, abnormally thin-walled, small blood vessels that displace normal neurological tissue in the brain or spinal cord. The vessels are filled with slow-moving or stagnant blood that is usually clotted or in a state of decomposition. Like AVMs, cavernous malformations can range in size from a few fractions of an inch to several inches in diameter, depending on the number of blood vessels involved. Some people develop multiple lesions. Although cavernous malformations usually do not hemorrhage as severely as AVMs do, they sometimes leak blood into surrounding neurological tissues because the walls of the involved blood vessels are extremely fragile. Although they are often not as symptomatic as AVMs, cavernous malformations can cause seizures in some people. After AVMs, cavernous malformations are the type of vascular lesion most likely to require treatment. Capillary telangiectases. These lesions consist of groups of abnormally swollen capillaries and usually measure less than an inch in diameter. Capillaries are the smallest of all blood vessels, with diameters smaller than that of a human hair; they have the capacity to transport only small quantities of blood, and blood flows through these vessels very slowly. Because of these factors, telangiectases rarely cause extensive damage to surrounding brain or spinal cord tissues. Any isolated hemorrhages that occur are microscopic in size. Thus, the lesions are usually benign. However, in some inherited disorders in which people develop large numbers of these lesions (see below), telangiectases can contribute to the development of nonspecific neurological symptoms such as headaches or seizures. Venous malformations. These lesions consist of abnormally enlarged veins. The structural defect usually does not interfere with the function of the blood vessels, which is to drain oxygen-depleted blood away from the body's tissues and return it to the lungs and heart. Venous malformations rarely hemorrhage. As with telangiectases, most venous malformations do not produce symptoms, remain undetected, and follow a benign course."
What Causes Vascular Lesions?,"'Although the cause of these vascular anomalies of the central nervous system is not yet well understood, scientists believe that they most often result from mistakes that occur during embryonic or fetal development. These mistakes may be linked to genetic mutations in some cases. A few types of ''vascular malformations'' are known to be hereditary and thus are known to have a genetic basis. Some evidence also suggests that at least some of these lesions are acquired later in life as a result of injury to the central nervous system.''During fetal development, new blood vessels continuously form and then disappear as the ''human body'"" changes and grows. These changes in the body's vascular map continue after birth and are controlled by angiogenic factors, chemicals produced by the body that stimulate new blood vessel formation and growth. Researchers have recently identified changes in the chemical structures of various angiogenic factors in some people who have AVMs or other vascular abnormalities of the central nervous system. However, it is not yet clear how these chemical changes actually cause changes in blood vessel structure.""'By studying patterns of familial occurrence, researchers have established that one type of cavernous malformation involving multiple lesion formation is caused by a genetic mutation in chromosome 7. This genetic mutation appears in many ethnic groups, but it is especially frequent in a large population of Hispanic Americans living in the Southwest; these individuals share a common ancestor in whom the genetic change occurred. Some other types of vascular defects of the central nervous system are part of larger medical syndromes known to be hereditary. They include ''hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia'' (also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease), Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, Parkes-Weber syndrome, and Wyburn-Mason syndrome.' "
How Are AVMs and Other Vascular Lesions Detected?,"'Physicians now use an array of traditional and new imaging technologies to uncover the presence of AVMs. ''Angiography'' provides the most accurate pictures of blood vessel structure in AVMs. The technique requires injecting a special water-soluble dye, called a contrast agent, into an artery. The dye highlights the structure of blood vessels so that it can be recorded on conventional ''X-rays''. Although angiography can record fine details of vascular lesions, the procedure is somewhat invasive and carries a slight risk of causing a ''stroke''. Its safety, however, has recently been improved through the development of more precise techniques for delivering dye to the site of an AVM. Superselective angiography involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery; a physician guides the tip of the catheter to the site of the lesion and then releases a small amount of contrast agent directly into the lesion.''Two of the most frequently employed noninvasive imaging technologies used to detect AVMs are computed axial tomography (CT) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scans. ''CT scans'' use X-rays to create a series of cross-sectional images of the head, brain, or spinal cord and are especially useful in revealing the presence of hemorrhage. MRI imaging, however, offers superior diagnostic information by using magnetic fields to detect subtle changes in neurological tissues. A recently developed application of MRI technology -- magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) -- can record the pattern and velocity of blood flow through vascular lesions as well as the flow of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the brain and spinal cord. CT, MRI, and MRA can provide three-dimensional representations of AVMs by taking images from multiple angles. ' "
How Can AVMs and Other Vascular Lesions Be Treated?,"'Medication can often alleviate general symptoms such as ''headache'', ''back pain'', and seizures caused by AVMs and other vascular lesions. However, the definitive treatment for AVMs is either surgery or focused irradiation therapy. Venous malformations and capillary telangiectases rarely require surgery; moreover, their structures are diffuse and usually not suitable for surgical correction and they usually do not require treatment anyway. Cavernous malformations are usually well defined enough for surgical removal, but surgery on these lesions is less common than for AVMs because they do not pose the same risk of hemorrhage.''The decision to perform surgery on any individual with an AVM requires a careful consideration of possible benefits versus risks. The natural history of an individual AVM is difficult to predict; however, left untreated, they have the potential of causing significant hemorrhage, which may result in serious neurological deficits or death. On the other hand, surgery on any part of the central nervous system carries its own risks as well; AVM surgery is associated with an estimated 8 percent risk of serious complications or death. There is no easy formula that can allow physicians and their patients to reach a decision on the best course of therapy -- all therapeutic decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis.''Today, three surgical options exist for the treatment of AVMs: conventional surgery, endovascular embolization, and radiosurgery. The choice of treatment depends largely on the size and location of an AVM.''Conventional surgery involves entering the brain or spinal cord and removing the central portion of the AVM, including the fistula, while causing as little damage as possible to surrounding neurological structures. This surgery is most appropriate when an AVM is located in a superficial portion of the brain or spinal cord and is relatively small in size. AVMs located deep inside the brain generally cannot be approached through conventional surgical techniques because there is too great a possibility that functionally important brain tissue will be damaged or destroyed.''Endovascular embolization and radiosurgery are less invasive than conventional surgery and offer safer treatment options for some AVMs located deep inside the brain. In endovascular embolization the surgeon guides a catheter though the arterial network until the tip reaches the site of the AVM. The surgeon then introduces a substance that will plug the fistula, correcting the abnormal pattern of blood flow. This process is known as embolization because it causes an embolus (an object or substance) to travel through blood vessels, eventually becoming lodged in a vessel and obstructing blood flow. The embolic materials used to create an artificial ''blood clot'' in the center of an AVM include fast-drying biologically inert glues, fibered titanium coils, and tiny balloons. Since embolization usually does not permanently obliterate the AVM, it is usually used as an adjunct to surgery or to radiosurgery to reduce the blood flow through the AVM and make the surgery safer.''Radiosurgery is an even less invasive therapeutic approach. It involves aiming a beam of highly focused ''radiation'' directly on the AVM. The high dose of radiation damages the walls of the blood vessels making up the lesion. Over the course of the next several months, the irradiated vessels gradually degenerate and eventually close, leading to the resolution of the AVM.''Embolization frequently proves incomplete or temporary, although in recent years new embolization materials have led to improved results. Radiosurgery often has incomplete results as well, particularly when an AVM is large, and it poses the additional risk of radiation damage to surrounding normal tissues. Moreover, even when successful, complete closure of an AVM takes place over the course of many months following radiosurgery. During that period, the risk of hemorrhage is still present. However, both techniques now offer the possibility of treating deeply situated AVMs that had previously been inaccessible. And in many individuals, staged embolization followed by conventional surgical removal or by radiosurgery is now performed, resulting in further reductions in mortality and complication rates.''Because so many variables are involved in treating AVMs, doctors must assess the danger posed to individuals largely on a case-by-case basis. The consequences of hemorrhage are potentially disastrous, leading many clinicians to recommend surgical intervention whenever the physical characteristics of an AVM appear to indicate a greater-than-usual likelihood of significant bleeding and resultant neurological damage.'  "
What Research is Being Done? ,"'Within the Federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has primary responsibility for sponsoring research on neurological disorders. As part of its mission, the NINDS conducts research on AVMs and other vascular lesions of the central nervous system and supports studies through grants to major medical institutions across the country.''In partnership with the medical school of Columbia University, the NINDS has established a long-term Arteriovenous Study Group to learn more about the natural course of AVMs in patients and to improve the surgical treatment of these lesions.''Another group of NINDS-sponsored researchers is currently studying large populations of patients with AVMs to formulate criteria that will allow doctors to predict more accurately the risk of hemorrhage in individual patients. Of particular importance is the role that ''high blood pressure'' within the lesion plays in the onset of hemorrhage. Other scientists are examining the genetic basis of familial cavernous malformations and other hereditary syndromes that cause neurological vascular lesions, including ''ataxia telangiectasia''.''Other scientists are seeking to refine the techniques now available to treat AVMs. Radiosurgery is a special area of interest because this technology is still in its infancy. An ongoing study is closely examining the precise effects that radiation exposure has on vascular tissue in order to improve the predictability and consistency of treatment results.'""Finally, several ongoing studies are devoted to developing new noninvasive neuroimaging technologies to increase the effectiveness and safety of AVM surgery. Some scientists are pioneering the use of MRI to measure amounts of oxygen present in the brain tissue of patients with vascular lesions in order to predict the brain's response to surgical therapies. Others are developing a new micro-imager that may be inserted into catheters to increase the accuracy of angiography. In addition, new types of noninvasive imaging devices are being developed that detect functional brain activity through changes in tissue light emission or reflectance. This technology may prove more sensitive than MRI and other imaging devices currently available, giving surgeons a new tool for improving the efficacy and safety of AVM surgery."" "
What is arthritis?,"'Arthritis is a joint disorder featuring inflammation. A joint is an area of the body where two different bones meet. A joint functions to move the body parts connected by its bones. Arthritis literally means inflammation of one or more joints.''Arthritis is frequently accompanied by ''joint pain''. Joint ''pain'' is referred to as arthralgia. When four or more joints are involved, the arthritis is referred to as polyarthritis. When two or three joints are involved, it is referred to as oligoarthritis. When only a single joint is involved, it is referred to as monoarthritis.' "
How many types of arthritis exist?,"'There are many types of arthritis (over 100 identified). The types of arthritis range from those related to wear and tear of cartilage (such as ''osteoarthritis'') to those associated with inflammation resulting from a misdirected immune system (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''). While osteoarthritis and ''rheumatoid arthritis'' are common types of arthritis, there are many other common and uncommon types of arthritis. Other types of inflammatory arthritis include''Together, the many types of arthritis make up the most common chronic illness in the United States. Self-limited forms of arthritis can occur in association with virus infections.' psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and reactive arthritis. Types of infectious arthritis include septic arthritis and Lyme arthritis."
What are arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited function of joints. Joint inflammation from arthritis is characterized by ''joint stiffness'', swelling, redness, pain, and warmth.''Many of the forms of arthritis, because they are rheumatic diseases, can cause symptoms affecting various organs of the body that do not directly involve the joints. Therefore, symptoms in some patients with certain forms of arthritis can also include'   Stiffness of the joint can lead to poor function. Tenderness of the inflamed joint can be present with or without pain. When large joints are involved, such as the knee, there can be loss of cartilage with limitation of motion from the joint damage. When arthritis affects the small joints in fingers, there can be bone growth and loss of hand grip and grip strength of the hand associated with stiffness. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can lead to difficulty walking from poor joint function and arthritis pain. fever, gland swelling (swollen lymph nodes), weight loss, fatigue, feeling unwell, and even symptoms from abnormalities of organs such as the lungs, heart, or kidneys."
"What is a rheumatologist, and what specialties of doctors treat arthritis?","'A rheumatologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the nonsurgical treatment of rheumatic illnesses, especially arthritis.''Rheumatologists'' have special interests in unexplained ''rash'', ''fever'', arthritis, ''anemia'', ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fatigue'', joint or ''muscle pain'', autoimmune disease, and ''anorexia''. They often serve as consultants, acting like medical detectives at the request of other doctors.''Rheumatologists have particular skills in the evaluation of the over 100 forms of arthritis and have special interests in inflammatory arthritis such as''Classical adult ''rheumatology'' training includes four years of medical school, one year of internship in internal medicine, two years of internal-medicine residency, and two years of rheumatology fellowship. There is a subspecialty board for rheumatology certification, offered by the American Board of Internal Medicine, which can provide board certification to approved rheumatologists.''Other doctors who treat arthritis include' rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative arthritis, spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Still's disease, dermatomyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, vasculitis, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, back pain, gout, pseudogout, relapsing polychondritis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, serum sickness, reactive arthritis, Kawasaki disease, fibromyalgia, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's disease, growing pains, iritis, osteoporosis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and others. Pediatric rheumatologists are physicians who specialize in providing comprehensive care to children (as well as their families) with rheumatic diseases, especially arthritis. Pediatric rheumatologists are pediatricians who have completed an additional two to three years of specialized training in pediatric rheumatology and are usually board-certified in pediatric rheumatology. pediatricians, internists, general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and orthopedic surgeons."
Whom does arthritis affect?,"'Arthritis sufferers include men and women, children, and adults.' "
What causes arthritis?,"'The causes of arthritis depend on the form of arthritis. Causes include''Arthritis is classified as one of the rheumatic diseases. These are conditions that are different individual illnesses, with differing features, treatments, complications, and prognoses. They are similar in that they have a tendency to affect the joints, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, and tendons, and many have the potential to affect other internal body areas.' injury (leading to osteoarthritis), metabolic abnormalities (such as gout with elevated uric acid blood levels and pseudogout with hypercalcemia), hereditary factors, the direct and indirect effect of infections (bacterial and viral), and a misdirected immune system with autoimmunity (such as in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)."
What are risk factors for arthritis?,'The major risk factors for most forms of arthritis are genes that are ''inherited'' from ancestors. ''Trauma''-related arthritis is related to the risk of injury from specific activities.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose arthritis?,"'The first step in the diagnosis of arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor will review the history of symptoms, examine the joints for inflammation and deformity, as well as ask questions about or examine other parts of the body for inflammation or signs of diseases that can affect other body areas. Furthermore, medical professionals might order certain blood (''C-reactive protein'', ''sedimentation rate'', ''rheumatoid factor'', anti-CCP antibody, etc.), urine, joint fluid, and/or X-ray tests. Plain X-ray testing can be used to easily detect signs of osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing and spur formation (''osteophytes''). A doctor will make a diagnosis based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and any blood and X-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. A doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist (see below).''Many forms of arthritis are more of an annoyance than serious. However, millions of people suffer daily with pain and disability from arthritis or its complications.''Earlier and accurate diagnosis can help to prevent irreversible damage and disability. Properly guided programs of ''exercise'' and rest, medications, physical therapy, and surgery options can idealize long-term outcomes for those with arthritis. ''Exercise'' and exercise routines can be helpful in providing joint stability by strengthening the musculoskeletal system while improving balance. Physical therapists can provide the care needed for properly guided exercise regimens.'""It should be noted that both before and especially after the diagnosis of arthritis, communication with the treating doctor is essential for optimal health. This is important from the standpoint of the doctor, so that he/she can be aware of the vagaries of the patient's symptoms as well as their tolerance of and acceptance of treatments. It is important from the standpoint of patients, so that they can be assured that they have an understanding of the diagnosis and how the condition does and might affect them. It is also crucial for the safe use of medications."" "
Is there an arthritis diet?,"'For most forms of arthritis, diets play little or no role in precipitating or exacerbating the condition. However, in general, oils of fish have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Some osteoarthritis suffers benefit from ''omega-3'' fatty acid ''supplements''. Some people with osteoarthritis feel they benefit from the curcumin that is present in curry foods.''Gout'' is a particular type of metabolic arthritis that is clearly ''diet''-related. Foods that are high in purines, especially red meats and shellfish, can worsen the condition. Moreover, certain foods elevate the levels of uric acid, including ''alcohol'' (especially beer) and those foods containing high amounts of fructose (such as the ''corn'' syrup found in soft ''drinks''). For people with ''celiac disease'', ''gluten''-containing foods (wheat, barley, rye) can worsen ''joint pains''.'  "
Are there foods to avoid when you have arthritis?,"'With the exception of the unique metabolic form of arthritis in ''gout'' and ''celiac disease'', there are no universally accepted foods that must be avoided by people with arthritis. That is, most foods are joint friendly. ''Gout'', however, can be promoted and precipitated by ''dehydration'' as well as fructose-containing foods (''corn'' syrup, etc.), high-purine foods (seafood, shellfish, organ meats), and alcoholic ''beverages'' (particularly beer). People with gout should avoid these foods. The arthritis of ''celiac disease'' can be worsened by intake of gluten-containing foods (wheat, barley, rye).' "
What are medications and treatment options for arthritis?,"'The treatment of arthritis is very dependent on the precise type of arthritis present. An accurate diagnosis increases the chances for successful treatment. Treatments available include physical therapy, home remedies, splinting, ''cold''-pack application, paraffin wax dips, anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', pain medications (ranging from pain-relieving ''over-the-counter'' medications such as ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol''] and ''ibuprofen'' [''Motrin'', ''Advil''] to narcotics), immune-altering medications, biologic medications, and surgical operations (including joint replacement surgery). Pain from osteoarthritis of the knee can be relieved by ''hyaluronic acid'' injections. Rheumatoid arthritis can require medications that suppress the immune system (disease modifying medications). Low back arthritis that is irritating nerves of the spine can require surgical repair. For more on treatments of particular forms of arthritis, see the corresponding articles for the form of arthritis of interest.'  "
"What are the prognosis (outlook) for arthritis, and what are arthritis complications?","'The outlook for patients with arthritis depends on its severity, complications, and whether or not there are non-joint manifestations of the disease. For example, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the lungs, kidneys, eyes, etc. Chronic joint inflammation can lead to permanent damage to the joint and loss of joint function, making movement difficult or impossible.' "
Is it possible to prevent arthritis?,"""Since most forms of arthritis are inherited to some degree, there is no real way to prevent them. Arthritis that follows joint injury could be prevented by adhering to safety regulations and trying to avoid becoming injured. Arthritis related to infection (for examples, septic arthritis, reactive arthritis, Whipple's disease) could be prevented by not becoming infected with the causative organism. The extent to which this is possible varies depending upon the individual condition."" "
What is the Arthritis Foundation?,"'The Arthritis Foundation is the only national voluntary health organization whose purpose is directed solely to all forms of arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation has national and international programs involving support for scientific research, public information and education for affected patients and their families, training of specialists, public awareness, and local community assistance.''Local branch chapters of the Arthritis Foundation serve to disseminate information about arthritis and rheumatic diseases, as well as function as referral centers. Moreover, many of the various forms of arthritis have their own foundations that serve as information and referral health resources for local communities.''It is the ultimate goal of scientific arthritis research that optimal treatment programs are designed for each of the many form of arthritis. This field will continue to evolve as improvements develop in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and related conditions.' "
Facts you should know about ankylosing spondylitis," Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis featuring chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints (sacroiliitis). Ankylosing spondylitis belongs to a group of arthritis conditions that tend to cause chronic inflammation of the spine (spondyloarthropathies). Ankylosing spondylitis affects males two to three times more commonly than females. Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of back pain in adolescents and young adults. The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is genetically inherited. The HLA-B27 gene can be detected in the blood of most patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis can also affect the eyes, heart, lungs, and occasionally the kidneys. The optimal treatment of ankylosing spondylitis involves medications that reduce inflammation or suppress immunity, physical therapy, and exercise."
What is ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of chronic inflammation of the spine and the sacroiliac joints. The sacroiliac joints are located at the base of the low back where the ''sacrum'' (the bone directly above the tailbone) meets the iliac bones (bones on either side of the upper buttocks) of the pelvis. Chronic inflammation in these areas causes ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' in and around the spine, including the neck, middle back, lower back, and buttocks. Over time, chronic inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) can lead to a complete cementing together (fusion) of the vertebrae, a process referred to as ''ankylosis''. Ankylosis causes loss of mobility of the spine.''Ankylosing spondylitis is also a systemic disease, meaning it can affect tissues throughout the body, not just the spine. Accordingly, it can cause inflammation in and injury to other joints away from the spine manifest as arthritis, as well as to other organs, such as the eyes, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Ankylosing spondylitis shares many features with several other arthritis conditions, such as ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease), and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause disease and inflammation in the spine, other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine, these medical conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies."" Ankylosing spondylitis is considered one of the many rheumatic diseases because it can cause symptoms involving muscles and joints.'""Ankylosing spondylitis is two to three times more common in men than in women. In women, joints away from the spine are more frequently affected than in men. Ankylosing spondylitis affects all age groups, including children. When it affects children, it is referred to as juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. The most common age of onset of symptoms is in the second and third decades of life. Ankylosing spondylitis is often abbreviated AS and has been referred to as Bechterew's disease.""  "
What causes ankylosing spondylitis?,"'The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is believed to be genetically inherited, and a majority (nearly 90%) of people with ankylosing spondylitis are born with a gene known as the HLA-B27 gene. Blood tests have been developed to detect the HLA-B27 gene marker and have furthered our understanding of the relationship between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis. The HLA-B27 gene appears only to increase the tendency of developing ankylosing spondylitis, while some additional factor(s), perhaps environmental factors, are necessary for the disease to appear or become expressed. For example, while 7% of the United States population has the HLA-B27 gene, only 1% of the population actually has the disease ankylosing spondylitis. In northern Scandinavia (Lapland), 1.8% of the population has ankylosing spondylitis while 24% of the general population has the HLA-B27 gene. Even among individuals whose HLA-B27 blood test is positive, the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis appears to be further related to heredity. In HLA-B27-positive individuals who have relatives with the disease, the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis is 12% (six times greater than for those whose relatives do not have ankylosing spondylitis).''Other genes have been identified that are associated with ankylosing spondylitis, including ARTS1 and IL23R. These genes seem to play a role in influencing immune function. It is anticipated that by understanding the effects of each of these known gene risk factors medical researchers will make significant progress in discovering a cure for ankylosing spondylitis.'""How inflammation occurs and persists in different organs and joints in ankylosing spondylitis is a subject of active health research. Each individual tends to have their own unique pattern of presentation and activity of the illness. The initial inflammation may be a result of an activation of the body's immune system, perhaps by a preceding bacterial infection or a combination of infectious microbes. Once activated, the body's immune system becomes unable to turn itself off, even though the initial bacterial infection may have long subsided. Chronic tissue inflammation resulting from the continued activation of the body's own immune system in the absence of active infection is the hallmark of an inflammatory autoimmune disease."" "
What are ankylosing spondylitis symptoms and signs?,"'The ''symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis'' are related to inflammation of the spine, joints, and other parts of the body. ''Fatigue'' is a common symptom associated with active inflammation. Inflammation of the spine causes ''pain'' and stiffness in the low back, upper buttock area, neck, and the remainder of the spine. The onset of pain and stiffness is usually gradual and progressively worsens with loss of range of motion noticeable over months. Occasionally, the onset is rapid and intense (flare-up). ''Lumbar pain'' (''low back pain'') and ''buttock pain'' are common manifestations of active inflammation in the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. The symptoms of pain and stiffness are often worse in the morning or after prolonged periods of inactivity. Motion, heat, and a warm shower often reduces pain and stiffness in the morning. Because ankylosing spondylitis often affects adolescents, the onset of ''low back pain'' is sometimes incorrectly attributed to athletic injuries in younger patients.''Those who have chronic, severe inflammation of the spine can develop a complete bony fusion of the spine (ankylosis). Once fused, the pain in the spine disappears, but the affected individual has a complete loss of spine mobility. These fused spines are particularly brittle and vulnerable to breakage (''fracture'') when involved in ''trauma'' such as motor-vehicle accidents. A sudden onset of pain and mobility in the spinal area of these patients can indicate bone breakage. The lower neck (cervical spine) is the most common area for such ''fractures''.''Chronic spondylitis and ankylosis cause forward curvature of the upper torso (thoracic spine), which limits ''breathing'' capacity. Spondylitis can also affect the areas where ribs attach to the upper spine, further limiting lung capacity. Ankylosing spondylitis can cause inflammation and scarring of the lungs, causing ''coughing'' and ''shortness of breath'', especially with ''exercise'' and infections. Therefore, breathing difficulty can be a serious complication of ankylosing spondylitis.''People with ankylosing spondylitis can also have arthritis in joints other than the spine. This feature occurs more commonly in women. Patients may notice pain, stiffness, heat, swelling, warmth, and/or redness in joints such as the hips, knees, and ankles. Occasionally, the small joints of the toes can become inflamed or ""sausage"" shaped. Inflammation can occur in the cartilage around the breastbone (''costochondritis'') as well as in the tendons where the muscles attach to the bone (tendinitis) and in ligament attachments to bone (''enthesitis''). Some people with this disease develop Achilles tendinitis, causing pain and stiffness in the back of the heel, especially when pushing off with the foot while ''walking'' upstairs. Inflammation of the tissues of the bottom of the foot, ''plantar fasciitis'', occurs more frequently in people with ankylosing spondylitis.''Other areas of the body affected by ankylosing spondylitis include the eyes, heart, and kidneys. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis can develop inflammation of the ''iris'' (''iritis''), the colored portion of the eye. Iritis is characterized by redness and pain in the eye, especially when looking at bright lights. Recurrent attacks of iritis can affect either eye. In addition to the iris, the ciliary body and choroid of the eye can become inflamed; this is referred to as ''uveitis''. Iritis and ''uveitis'"" can be serious complications of ankylosing spondylitis that can damage the eye and impair vision and may require an eye specialist's (ophthalmologist) urgent care. Special medical treatments for serious eye inflammation are discussed in the treatment section below. (It should be noted that iritis and inflammation of the spine can occur in other forms of arthritis such as ""'reactive arthritis'"" [formerly known as Reiter's syndrome], ""'psoriatic arthritis'', and the arthritis of ''inflammatory bowel disease''.)'""A rare complication of ankylosing spondylitis involves scarring of the heart's electrical system, causing an abnormally slow heart rate (referred to as ""'heart block''). A heart ''pacemaker'' may be necessary in these patients to maintain adequate heart rate and output. In others, the part of the ''aorta'' closest to the heart can become inflamed, resulting in leakage of the ''aortic valve''. In this case, patients can develop shortness of breath, ''dizziness'', and ''heart failure''.''Advanced spondylitis can lead to deposits of protein material called amyloid into the kidneys and result in ''kidney failure''. Progressive ''kidney disease'' can lead to ''chronic fatigue'' and ''nausea'' and can require removal of accumulated waste products in the blood by a filtering machine (''dialysis'').'  "
What specialties of health care professionals treat ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Health care professionals who treat ankylosing spondylitis include primary care doctors, internists, family practitioners, and general-medicine doctors, as well as orthopedists. ''Rheumatologists'' are internal-medicine subspecialists with a particular interest in diagnosing and treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis?,"""The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is based on evaluating the patient's symptoms, a physical examination, X-ray findings (radiographs), and blood tests. Stiffness, pain, and decreased range of motion of the spine are characteristic of the inflammatory ""'back pain'' of ankylosing spondylitis. Symptoms include pain and morning stiffness of the spine and sacral areas with or without accompanying inflammation in other joints, tendons, and organs. Early symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis can be very deceptive, as stiffness and pain in the low back can be seen in many other conditions. It can be particularly subtle in women, who tend to (though not always) have more mild spine involvement. Years of disease can pass before the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is even considered.''The examination can demonstrate signs of inflammation and decreased range of motion of joints. This can be particularly apparent in the spine. Flexibility of the low back and/or neck can be decreased. There may be tenderness of the sacroiliac joints of the upper buttocks. Chest expansion with full breathing can be limited because of rigidity of the chest wall. Severely affected people can have a ''stooped posture''. Inflammation of the eyes can be evaluated by the doctor with an ophthalmoscope.''Further clues to the diagnosis are suggested by X-ray abnormalities of the spine and the presence of the genetic marker HLA-B27 identified by a blood test. Other blood tests may provide evidence of inflammation in the body. For example, a blood test called the ''sedimentation rate'' is a nonspecific marker for inflammation throughout the body and is often elevated in inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. X-ray tests of the sacroiliac joints can demonstrate signs of inflammation and erosion of bone. ''X-rays'' of the spine can progressively demonstrate straightening, ""squaring"" of the vertebrae, and end-stage fusion of one vertebra to the next (ankylosis). Fusion up and down the spine can lead to a ""bamboo spine"" appearance on X-ray tests with complete loss of mobility.''Urinalysis'' is often done to look for accompanying abnormalities of the kidney as well as to exclude kidney conditions that may produce ''back pain'' that mimics ankylosing spondylitis. Patients are also simultaneously evaluated for symptoms and signs of other related spondyloarthropathies, such as ''psoriasis'', ''venereal disease'"", dysentery (reactive arthritis or Reiter's disease), and ""'inflammatory bowel disease'' (''ulcerative colitis'"" or Crohn's disease).""  "
What are home remedies for ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Physical therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes instructions and exercises to maintain proper posture. This includes deep breathing for lung expansion and stretching exercises to improve spine and joint mobility. Since ankylosis of the spine tends to cause forward curvature (''kyphosis''), patients are instructed to maintain erect posture as much as possible and to perform back-extension exercises. Patients are also advised to ''sleep'' on a firm mattress and avoid the use of a pillow in order to prevent ''spine curvature''. Ankylosing spondylitis can involve the areas where the ribs attach to the upper spine as well as the vertebral joints, thus limiting breathing capacity. Patients are instructed to maximally expand their chest frequently throughout each day to minimize this limitation.''Physical therapists customize exercise programs for each individual. ''Swimming'"" often can be a very beneficial form of exercise, as it avoids jarring impact of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis need not limit an individual's involvement in athletics. People can participate in carefully chosen aerobic sports when their disease is inactive. ""'Aerobic exercise'' is generally encouraged as it promotes full expansion of the breathing muscles and opens the airways of the lungs.''Cigarette smoking'' is strongly discouraged in people with ankylosing spondylitis, as it can accelerate lung scarring and seriously aggravate breathing difficulties. Occasionally, those with severe lung disease related to ankylosing spondylitis may require oxygen supplementation and medications to improve breathing.''People with ankylosing spondylitis may need to modify their activities of daily living and adjust features of the workplace. For example, workers can adjust chairs and desks for proper postures. Drivers can use wide rearview mirrors and prism glasses to compensate for the limited motion in the spine.' "
What are ankylosing spondylitis treatment options?,"'The treatment of ankylosing spondylitis typically involves the use of medications to reduce inflammation and/or suppress immunity to stop progression of the disease, physical therapy, and exercise. Medications decrease inflammation in the spine and other joints and organs. Physical therapy and exercise help improve posture, spine mobility, and lung capacity.''Aspirin'' and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly used to decrease pain and stiffness of the spine and other joints. Commonly used NSAIDs include ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''). Their common side effects include stomach upset, ''nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and even bleeding ulcers. These medicines are frequently taken with food in order to minimize side effects.'""In some people with ankylosing spondylitis, inflammation of joints excluding the spine (such as the hips, knees, or ankles) becomes the major problem. Inflammation in these joints may not respond to NSAIDs alone. For these individuals, the addition of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that suppress the body's immune system is considered. These medications, such as\xa0""'sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine), may bring about long-term reduction of inflammation. An alternative to sulfasalazine that is somewhat more effective is ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), which can be administered orally or by injection. Frequent blood tests are performed during methotrexate treatment because of its potential for toxicity to the ''liver'', which can even lead to ''cirrhosis'', and toxicity to bone marrow, which can lead to severe ''anemia''.''Medical research has shown that for persistent ankylosing spondylitis with spinal involvement that is unresponsive to anti-inflammatory medications, both sulfasalazine and methotrexate are ineffective. Newer, effective medications for spine disease attack a messenger protein of inflammation called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF). These TNF-blocking medications have been shown to be extremely effective for treating ankylosing spondylitis by stopping disease activity, decreasing inflammation, and improving spinal mobility. Examples of these TNF-blockers include ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), and ''golimumab'' (''Simponi''). In 2016, adalimumab (Humira) was approved for the treatment of ''uveitis'' (inflammation in the eyes).''Several major points about the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis deserve emphasis. There is an early, underdiagnosed stage of spondylitis that occurs before plain X-ray testing can detect classic changes. Patients who are treated earlier respond better to treatments. Current disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and ''leflunomide'' (''Arava''), which can be effective for ''joint inflammation'' of joints away from the spine, are ''not'' effective for spinal inflammation. If nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not effective in a patient whose condition is dominated by spinal inflammation (and 50% do respond), then biologic medications that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF inhibitors) are used. All TNF inhibitors, including Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, and Simponi can be effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis. The improvement that results for TNF inhibition is sustained during years of treatment. If the TNF inhibitors are discontinued, for whatever reason, relapse of disease occurs in virtually all patients within a year. If TNF inhibitor is then resumed, it is typically effective.''Oral or injectable ''corticosteroids'' (cortisone) are potent anti-inflammatory agents and can effectively control spondylitis and other inflammations in the body. Unfortunately, corticosteroids can have serious side effects when used on a long-term basis. So they are typically used for short periods when possible. These side effects include ''cataracts'', thinning of the skin and bones (''osteoporosis''), ''easy bruising'', infections, ''diabetes'', and destruction of large joints, such as the hips.''Inflammation and diseases in other organs are treated separately. For example, inflammation of the iris of the eyes (iritis or uveitis) may require cortisone eyedrops (Pred Forte) and high doses of cortisone by mouth. Additionally, ''atropine'' eyedrops are often given to relax the muscles of the iris. Sometimes injections of cortisone into the affected eye are necessary when the inflammation is severe. ''Heart disease'' in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, such as heart block, may require a pacemaker placement or medications for ''congestive heart failure''.''Finally, orthopedic surgery may be required when there is severe disease of the hip joints and spine.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with ankylosing spondylitis?,"'The outlook for patients with ankylosing spondylitis is very much dependent upon the location and severity of its manifestations. The prognosis is best for those who maintain close monitoring with the treating doctors and who incorporate physical activities designed to maintain mobility. Quitting ''smoking'' is essential for the best long-term outcome. It has been found that people with ankylosing spondylitis have somewhat of an increased health risk for ''coronary artery disease''. This increased risk appears to be caused by chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is important to optimize all modifiable cardiac risks, including elevated ''blood pressure'' and ''cholesterol''.'  "
Is it possible to prevent ankylosing spondylitis?,'There is no ''prevention'' for this inherited (genetic) disease. Prevention measures are directed toward preventing complications of the disease with optimal treatments and monitoring for side effects of the treatments. Exercise can help to maintain flexibility.' 
What is in the future for patients with ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Ankylosing spondylitis and each of the spondyloarthropathies are areas of active health research. The relationship between infectious agents and the triggering of chronic inflammation is vigorously being pursued. Factors that perpetuate ""autoimmunity"" are being identified. The characteristics of the gene marker HLA-B27 are being further defined. In fact, there are now known to be seven different subtypes of HLA-B27.''The impact of the recent discovery of the two additional genes, ARTS1 and IL23R, associated with ankylosing spondylitis (described above under ""Causes"") cannot be overstated. These genes seem to play a role in influencing immune function. It is anticipated that by understanding the effects of each of these known genes researchers will make significant progress in discovering a cure for ankylosing spondylitis.''As more about the precise mechanisms these genes use to influence the immune system is understood, the discovery of a cure will be possible. Moreover, results of ongoing research will lead to a better understanding and optimal treatment options of the entire group of diseases collectively known as spondyloarthropathies.' "

Facts you should know about osteoarthritis," Osteoarthritis is a joint inflammation that results from cartilage degeneration. Degenerative joint disease is another name for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can be caused by aging, heredity, and injury from trauma or disease. The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joint(s) after repetitive use. Other osteoarthritis symptoms and signs includeswollen joints,joint stiffness,joint creaking, andloss of range of motion. swollen joints, joint stiffness, joint creaking, and loss of range of motion. There is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The goal of treatment in osteoarthritis is to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function."
What is osteoarthritis?,"'Osteoarthritis is a form of ''arthritis'' that features the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. Cartilage is a protein substance that serves as a ""cushion"" between the bones of the joints. Among the over 100 different types of arthritis conditions, osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease. OA occurs more frequently as we age. Before age 45, osteoarthritis occurs more frequently in males. After 55 years of age, it occurs more frequently in females. In the United States, all races appear equally affected. Hand osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, and knee osteoarthritis are much more common in seniors than younger people. A higher incidence of osteoarthritis exists in the Japanese population, while South-African blacks, East Indians, and Southern Chinese have lower rates. Osteoarthritis is abbreviated as OA or referred to as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease (DJD).''Osteoarthritis commonly affects''Osteoarthritis usually has no known cause and is referred to as primary osteoarthritis. When the cause of the osteoarthritis is known, the condition is referred to as secondary OA.'   the hands, feet, spine, and large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees."
What causes osteoarthritis?,"'Primary (idiopathic) osteoarthritis, OA not resulting from injury or disease, is partly a result of natural ''aging'' of the joint.''Secondary osteoarthritis is a form of osteoarthritis that is caused by another disease or condition. Conditions that can lead to secondary osteoarthritis include''Obesity causes osteoarthritis by increasing the mechanical ''stress'' on the joint and therefore on the cartilage. In fact, next to aging, obesity is the most significant risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knees. The early development of osteoarthritis of the knees among weight lifters is believed to be in part due to their high body weight. Repeated trauma to joint tissues (ligaments, bones, and cartilage) is believed to lead to early osteoarthritis of the knees in soccer players and army military personnel. Interestingly, health studies have not found an increased risk of osteoarthritis in long-distance runners.''Crystal deposits in the cartilage can cause cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis. Uric acid crystals cause arthritis in ''gout'', while calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause arthritis in ''pseudogout''.''Some people are born with abnormally formed joints (congenital abnormalities) that are vulnerable to mechanical wear, causing early degeneration and loss of joint cartilage. Osteoarthritis of the hip joints is commonly related to structural abnormalities of these joints that had been present since birth.''Hormone disturbances, such as ''diabetes'' and growth hormone disorders, are also associated with early cartilage wear and secondary osteoarthritis.' With aging, the water content of the cartilage increases, and the protein makeup of cartilage degenerates as a function of biologic processes. Eventually, cartilage begins to degenerate by flaking or forming tiny crevasses. In advanced osteoarthritis, there is a total loss of the cartilage cushion between the bones of the joints. Repetitive use of the worn joints over the years can mechanically irritate and inflame the cartilage, causing joint pain and swelling. Loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between the bones, leading to pain and limitation of joint mobility. Inflammation of the cartilage can also stimulate new bone outgrowths (spurs, also referred to as osteophytes) to form around the joints. Osteoarthritis occasionally can develop in multiple members of the same family, implying a hereditary (genetic) basis for this condition. Osteoarthritis is therefore felt to be a result of a combination of each of the above factors that ultimately lead to a narrowing of the cartilage in the affected joint. obesity, repeated trauma or surgery to the joint structures, abnormal joints at birth (congenital abnormalities), gout, diabetes, hemochromatosis, and other hormone disorders."
What are osteoarthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Osteoarthritis is a disease that is isolated to the cartilage of the joints. Unlike many other forms of arthritis that are systemic illnesses (conditions that affect multiple areas of the body apart from the joints), such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and systemic ''lupus'', osteoarthritis does not affect other organs of the body. The most common symptom of osteoarthritis is pain in the affected joint(s) after repetitive use. This can lead to''Joint pain of osteoarthritis is usually worse later in the day. There can be''Pain and ''stiffness'' of the joints can also occur after long periods of inactivity (for example, sitting in a theater). In severe osteoarthritis, complete loss of the cartilage cushion causes friction between bones, causing pain even at rest or pain with limited motion.''Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from patient to patient. Symptoms debilitate some patients. On the other hand, others may have remarkably few symptoms in spite of dramatic degeneration of the joints apparent on ''X-rays''. Osteoarthritis can cause joint deformity as asymmetric cartilage loss in the joint leads to malalignment of a digit or limb. Symptoms also can be intermittent. It is not unusual for patients with osteoarthritis of the finger joints of the hands and knees to have years of pain-free intervals between symptoms. Osteoarthritis can lead to creaking (crepitus) of the joint, especially when severe cartilage loss leaves a joint ""bone-on-bone"" with little cartilage cushioning the joint during movement.''Osteoarthritis of the knees is often associated with excess upper body weight, with obesity, or a history of repeated injury and/or joint surgery. Progressive cartilage degeneration of the knee joints can lead to deformity and outward curvature of the knees, which is referred to as being ""bowlegged."" People with osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints (such as the knees) can develop a limp. The ''limping'' during load-bearing can worsen as more cartilage degenerates. In some patients, the pain, limping, and joint dysfunction may not respond to medications or other conservative measures. Therefore, severe osteoarthritis of the knees is one of the most common reasons for ''total knee replacement'' medical procedures in the United States.''Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine or lumbar spine causes pain in the neck or low back. Bony spurs, called osteophytes, that form along the arthritic spine can irritate spinal nerves, causing severe pain that can radiate from the spine as well as numbness and tingling of the affected parts of the body.'""Osteoarthritis causes the formation of hard, bony enlargements of the small joints of the fingers. Classic bony enlargement of the small joint at the end of the fingers is called a Heberden's node, named after a famous British doctor. The bony deformity is a result of the ""'bone spurs'"" from the osteoarthritis in that joint. Another common bony knob (node) occurs at the middle joint of the fingers in many patients with osteoarthritis and is called a Bouchard's node. Dr. Bouchard was a famous French doctor who also studied arthritis patients in the late 1800s. Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes may not be painful, but they are often associated with limitation of motion of the joint. The characteristic appearances of these finger nodes can be helpful in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis of the joint at the base of the big toe of the foot leads to the formation of a ""'bunion''. Osteoarthritis of the fingers and the toes may have a genetic basis and can be found in numerous female members of some families.'

How do health care professionals diagnose osteoarthritis?,"'There is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis, as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis.' X-rays of the affected joints can be used to diagnose osteoarthritis. The common X-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage, narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones, and bone spur formation. Simple X-ray testing can also be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assisting the decision-making as to when surgical intervention might be considered. Arthrocentesis is a procedure to remove joint fluid that is often performed in a health care professional's office. During arthrocentesis, a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. Joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout, infection, and other causes of arthritis. Removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain, swelling, and inflammation. Arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. Abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. If successful, patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. Finally, a careful analysis of the location, duration, and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. Bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. Therefore, the presence of Heberden's nodes, Bouchard's nodes, and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis."
Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis: What is the difference?," Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disorder of cartilage.It is not a systemic disease.It is not an autoimmune disease. It is not a systemic disease. It is not an autoimmune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, therefore, it features a misdirected immune system that attacks body tissues (particularly the joint lining tissue called synovium).Rheumatoid arthritis is also a systemic disease.Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis can attack tissues throughout the body beyond affected joints, including the lungs, eyes, and skin. Rheumatoid arthritis is also a systemic disease. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis can attack tissues throughout the body beyond affected joints, including the lungs, eyes, and skin."
What are 22 osteoarthritis home remedies and treatment options?,"'Aside from weight reduction and avoiding activities that exert excessive ''stress'' on the joint cartilage, there is no specific medical treatment to halt cartilage degeneration or to repair damaged cartilage in osteoarthritis. There is no medication to stop osteoarthritis (disease-modifying medication). The goal of treatment in osteoarthritis is to reduce joint pain and inflammation while improving and maintaining joint function.''Some patients with osteoarthritis have minimal or no pain and may not need treatment. Others may benefit from conservative measures such as''These measures are particularly important when large, weight-bearing joints are involved, such as the hips or knees. In fact, even modest weight reduction can help to decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis of the large joints, such as the knees and hips. Medications are used to complement the physical measures described above. Medication may be used topically, taken orally, or injected into the joints to decrease joint inflammation and pain. When conservative measures fail to control pain and improve joint function, surgery can be considered.''Resting sore joints decreases stress on the joints and relieves pain and swelling. Patients are asked to simply decrease the intensity and/or frequency of the activities that consistently cause joint pain.''Physical activity usually does not aggravate osteoarthritis when performed at levels that do not cause joint pain. ''Exercise'' is helpful for relief of symptoms of osteoarthritis in several ways, including strengthening the muscular support around the joints. It also prevents the joints from ""freezing up"" and improves and maintains joint mobility. Finally, it promotes weight reduction and endurance. Applying local heat before and ''cold'' packs after exercise can help relieve pain and inflammation. ''Swimming'' is particularly well suited for patients with osteoarthritis because it allows patients to exercise with minimal impact stress to the joints. Other popular exercises include''Aside from physical therapy, physical therapists can provide support devices, such as splints, canes, walkers, and ''braces''. These medical devices can be helpful in reducing stress on the joints. Occupational therapy can assess the demands of daily activities and suggest additional devices that may help people at work or home. Finger splints can support individual joints of the fingers. The following measures can help ease hand symptoms:''Spine symptoms can improve with a neck collar, lumbar corset, or a firm mattress, depending on what areas are involved.''In many patients with osteoarthritis, mild pain relievers such as ''aspirin'' and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') may be sufficient treatment. Studies have shown that acetaminophen given in adequate doses for pain relief can often be equally as effective as prescription anti-inflammatory medications in relieving pain in osteoarthritis of the knees. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ''NSAIDS'' (see below), especially among elderly people, acetaminophen is generally the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. Medicine to relax muscles in spasm might also be given temporarily. Pain-relieving creams applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of minor arthritis pain. Examples of pain-relieving creams include''Topical treatments applied to the skin surface surrounding the joint affected by osteoarthritis include''Each of these provide some relief from osteoarthritis pain.''Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) are medications that are used to reduce pain and inflammation in the joints. Examples of NSAIDs include''It is sometimes possible to use NSAIDs temporarily and then discontinue them for periods of time without recurrent symptoms, thereby decreasing the risk of side effects.''The most common side effects of NSAIDs involve gastrointestinal distress, such as stomach upset, cramping ''diarrhea'', ulcers, and even bleeding. The risk of these and other side effects increases in the elderly. Newer NSAIDs called ''COX-2 inhibitors'' have been designed that have less toxicity to the stomach and bowels. Because osteoarthritis symptoms vary and can be intermittent, these medicines might be given only when ''joint pains'' occur or prior to activities that have traditionally brought on symptoms.''Some studies, but not all, have suggested that alternative treatment with the food ''supplements'' ''glucosamine'' and chondroitin can relieve symptoms of pain and stiffness for some people with osteoarthritis. These ''supplements'' are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription, although there is no certainty about the purity of the products or the dose of the active ingredients because they are not monitored by the U.S. FDA. The National Institutes of Health studied glucosamine in the treatment of the pain of osteoarthritis. Their initial research demonstrated only a minor benefit in relieving pain for those with the most severe osteoarthritis, and in most patients, there was no benefit greater than that from placebo pills. Further studies, it is hoped, will clarify many issues regarding dosing, safety, and effectiveness of different formulations of glucosamine for osteoarthritis. Patients taking blood thinners should be careful when taking chondroitin as it can increase the blood thinning and cause excessive bleeding. Fish-oil supplements have been shown to have some anti-inflammatory properties, and increasing the dietary fish intake and/or taking fish-oil capsules (''omega-3'' capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis.''While oral cortisone is generally not used in treating osteoarthritis, when injected directly into the inflamed joints, it can rapidly decrease pain and restore function. Since repetitive cortisone injections can be harmful to the tissues and bones, they are reserved for patients with more pronounced symptoms.''For persisting pain of severe osteoarthritis of the knee that does not respond to weight reduction, exercise, or medications, a series of injections of ''hyaluronic acid'' (''Synvisc'', ''Hyalgan'', Orthovisc, Supartz, Euflexxa, and others) into the joint can sometimes be helpful, especially if surgery is not being considered. These products seem to work by temporarily restoring the thickness of the joint fluid, allowing better joint lubrication and impact capability, and perhaps by directly affecting pain receptors.''Surgery is generally reserved for those patients with osteoarthritis that is particularly severe and unresponsive to the conservative treatments. Arthroscopy, discussed above, can be helpful when cartilage tears or loose pieces of cartilage are suspected. Osteotomy is a bone-removal procedure that can help realign some of the deformity in selected patients, usually those with certain forms of knee disease. Severely degenerated joints may be best treated by fusion (arthrodesis) or replacement with an artificial joint (joint replacement, or arthroplasty). Total hip and total knee replacements are now commonly performed in community hospitals throughout the United States.

What is the best treatment for osteoarthritis (OA)?,"'The ideal steps to take should lead to a proper diagnosis and an optimal long-term treatment plan. While many steps are described here, the plan must be customized for each person affected by osteoarthritis, depending on the joints affected and the severity of symptoms.''An opinion regarding the cause or the type of the arthritis can often be adequately obtained by consulting a general family doctor. It is often unnecessary to see an arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), like myself, for this purpose. However, if the diagnosis or treatment plan is unclear, a rheumatologist might be consulted.'""When I determine that a patient has a classic node formation from osteoarthritis (Heberden's node), I may make the diagnosis solely based upon the examination, without the need for any additional tests, such as blood or X-ray testing. Sometimes, testing can be helpful to better understand the degree and character of the osteoarthritis affecting a certain joint. It can also be helpful for monitoring and to exclude other conditions.""'Treatment may not be necessary for osteoarthritis of the hands with minimal or no symptoms. When symptoms are troubling and persist, however, treatment might include pain and anti-inflammatory medications, with or without food supplements, such as glucosamine and/or chondroitin. Furthermore, heat/cold applications and topical pain creams can be helpful.''As a first step, I recommend that patients go ahead and try the ''over-the-counter'' food supplements glucosamine and chondroitin. Each of these health supplements has been shown by some studies to relieve the pain and stiffness of some (but not all) patients with osteoarthritis. These supplements are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription. If patients do not benefit after a two-month trial, I suggest that they discontinue these supplements. Of note, the manufacturers sometimes make claims that these supplements ""rebuild"" cartilage. This claim has not been adequately verified by scientific studies to date.''For another type of dietary supplementation, it should be noted that fish oils have been shown to have some anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, increasing the dietary fish intake and/or ''fish oil'' capsules (omega-3 capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis. There is some evidence that ''vitamin D'' supplementation can reduce ''joint swelling'' of osteoarthritis.''Obesity has long been known to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knee. I recommend weight reduction for patients who are ''overweight'' with early signs of osteoarthritis of the hands, because they are at a risk for also developing osteoarthritis of their knees. Foods to avoid include those that promote ''weight gain''. As described above, even modest weight reduction can be helpful.''Pain medications that are available over the counter, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), can be very helpful in relieving the pain symptoms of mild osteoarthritis. I recommend these as the first-line medication treatment. Studies have shown that acetaminophen, given in adequate doses, can often be equally as effective as prescription anti-inflammatory medications in relieving pain in osteoarthritis of the knees. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), especially in elderly patients, acetaminophen is generally the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. If symptoms persist, then I recommend trials of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (''Advil'', Motrin IB, ''Nuprin''), ''ketoprofen'' (Orudis), and naproxen (''Aleve''). Many patients do best when they take these medications along with their glucosamine and chondroitin supplements.''Some patients get significant relief of pain symptoms by dipping their hands in hot wax (paraffin) dips in the morning. Hot wax can often be obtained at local pharmacies or medical supply stores. It can be prepared in a Crock-Pot and be reused after it hardens as a warm covering over the hands by peeling off and replacing it into the melted wax. Warm water soaks and nighttime cotton gloves (to keep the hands warm during ''sleep'') can also help ease hand symptoms. Performing gentle, low-impact range of motion exercises regularly can help to preserve function of the joints. These exercises are easiest to perform after early morning hand warming.''Pain-relieving creams that are applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of daytime minor arthritis pain. Examples include capsaicin (ArthriCare, Zostrix), salicin (Aspercreme), methyl salicylate (Ben-Gay, Icy Hot), and menthol (Flexall). For additional relief of mild symptoms, local ice application can sometimes be helpful, especially toward the end of the day. Occupational therapists can assess daily activities and determine which additional types of therapy may help patients at work or home.''Finally, when arthritis symptoms persist, it is best to seek the advice of a health care professional who can properly guide the optimal management for each individual patient. Many other prescription medications are available for the treatment of osteoarthritis for patients with chronic, annoying symptoms.''In addition to the steps described above, pay attention to joint problems elsewhere in the body if one develops early signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the hands.'

What is the prognosis for patients with osteoarthritis?,"'The prognosis of patients with osteoarthritis depends on which joints are affected and whether or not they are causing symptoms and impaired function.' Some patients are unaffected by osteoarthritis while others can be severely disabled. Joint replacement surgery for some results in the best long-term outcome. Finally, if one is concerned that osteoarthritis could be lead to injury of the internal organs, don't be. Osteoarthritis does not cause internal organ damage or blood-test abnormalities."
Is it possible to prevent osteoarthritis?,'There is no ''prevention'' of osteoarthritis with the exception of avoiding joint injury.'

What does the future hold for osteoarthritis?,"'In the future, medications may be available that protect the cartilage from the deteriorating consequences of osteoarthritis. Research into cartilage biology will eventually lead to new and exciting breakthroughs in the management of osteoarthritis.''Surgical innovation has led to a technique for the repair of isolated splits of cartilage (fissures) of the knee. In this procedure, a patient\'s own cartilage is actually grown in the laboratory, then inserted into the fissure area and sealed over with a ""patch"" of the patient\'s own bone covering the tissue. While this is not a procedure for the cartilage damage of osteoarthritis, it does open the door for future cartilage research. These and other developing areas hold promise for new approaches to an old problem.''Investigators at the National Institutes of Health have found that taking glucosamine did not significantly improve symptoms of osteoarthritis compared to placebo. Studies are under way to look at whether some glucosamine formulations may have advantages over others.''Research scientists have found that ''doxycycline'', a ''tetracycline'"" drug, slows the progression of cartilage degeneration in the knees of patients with osteoarthritis. This seems to be a result of the drug's effect on enzymes that destroy cartilage rather than on their properties as antibiotics. More studies and ""'clinical trials'' need to determine the significance of this interesting work and how specific treatments might be developed as a result.' "

Facts you should know about gout (gouty arthritis)," Gout is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation, usually in one joint, that begins suddenly. Gouty arthritis is caused by the deposition of needle-like crystals of uric acid in a joint. Gout symptoms and signs includenodules under the skin called tophi,joint redness,swollen joints,joint pain, andwarmth of the joint. nodules under the skin called tophi, joint redness, swollen joints, joint pain, and warmth of the joint. The most reliable method to diagnose gout is to have fluid removed from an inflamed joint and examined under a microscope for urate crystals. Chronic gout is treated using medications that lower the uric acid level in the body. Left untreated, gout can cause irreversible joint damage, kidney problems, and tophi. Triggers for acute attacks (flare-ups) of gout include surgery, dehydration, beverages sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup, beer, liquor, red meat, and seafood. Cherries may help prevent gout attacks."
What is gout?,"'Gout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden ''joint inflammation'', usually in a single joint. Severe gout can sometimes affect many joints at once. This is known as polyarticular gout.'  "
What causes gout?,"'Gout is caused by too much uric acid in the bloodstream and accumulation of urate crystals in tissues of the body. Uric acid crystal deposits in the joint cause inflammation of the joint leading to ''pain'', redness, heat, and swelling. Uric acid is normally found in the body as a byproduct of the way the body breaks down certain proteins called purines. Causes of an elevated blood uric acid level (hyperuricemia) include genetics, ''obesity'', certain medications such as diuretics (water pills), and chronic decreased kidney function (''kidney disease'').' "
What are risk factors for gout?,"'There are many risk factors for gout. Having ''high blood pressure'' is a risk factor for gout. Gout is more common after surgery, ''trauma'', and ''dehydration''. Certain medications such as diuretics (commonly known as water pills), which treat ''high blood pressure'', that raise the level of uric acid in the bloodstream are risks for gout. Surprisingly, medications that lower the level of uric acid in the bloodstream, such as ''allopurinol'' (Zyloprim, Aloprim), can also initially cause a flare of gout. This is because anything that raises or lowers the uric acid level can cause a gout flare by causing uric acid crystals to deposit in a joint. Low-dose ''aspirin'' can precipitate gout attacks. The treatment of certain types of ''cancer'' can cause gout because of high levels of uric acid released when the ''cancer'' cells are destroyed. ''Degenerative arthritis'' also makes affected joints more likely to be the site of a gouty attack.' "
What are gout symptoms and signs?,"'The characteristic symptoms and signs of gout are''These symptoms and signs usually affect a single joint. The pain is typically severe, reflecting the severity of inflammation in the joint. The affected joint is often very sensitive to touch to the point that some people with gout attacks experience pain from something as simple as pulling the bedsheets over the inflamed joint. The affected joint becomes swollen. The medical term for excessive fluid in a joint is a ""joint effusion.""''Gout frequently involves joints in the lower extremities. The classic location for gout to occur is the big toe (first metatarsophalangeal joint). ''Podagra'' is the medical term for inflammation at the base of the big toe. Gout can also affect the foot, knee, ankle, elbow, wrist, hands, or nearly any joint in the body. When gout is more severe or longstanding, multiple joints may be affected at the same time. This causes pain and ''joint stiffness'' in multiple joints.''Another sign of gout is the presence of tophi. A tophus is a hard nodule of uric acid that deposits under the skin. Tophi can be found in various locations in the body, commonly on the elbows, upper ear cartilage, and on the surface of other joints. When a tophus is present, it indicates that the body is substantially overloaded with uric acid. When tophi are present, the uric acid level in the bloodstream typically has been high for years. The presence of tophi indicates tophaceous gout and treatment with medications is necessary.''Longstanding untreated gout can lead to joint damage and physical deformity.''Kidney stones'' may be a sign of gout as uric acid crystals can deposit in the kidney and cause kidney stones.'

   sudden onset of joint pain, joint swelling, heat in the affected area, and joint redness."
What types of doctors treat gout?,"'Rheumatologists'' traditionally have expertise in diagnosing and treating gout, especially complicated situations. Other specialists such as internists, general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and orthopedists can manage straightforward cases of gout. Nephrologists may treat patients with uric-acid-lowering medications such as allopurinol in order to prevent damage to the kidneys, which can occur with elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia).' "
How do health care providers diagnose gout?,"'The most reliable method to diagnose gout is by demonstrating uric acid crystals in joint fluid that has been removed from an inflamed joint (''arthrocentesis''). Specially trained physicians, such as a ''rheumatologist'' or orthopedist, can carefully remove fluid from the joint. The fluid is then examined under a microscope to determine if uric acid crystals are present. This is important because other medical conditions and diseases, such as ''pseudogout'' (a type of arthritis caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals) and infection, can have symptoms similar to gout.' "
When should patients seek treatment for gout?,"'Changes in lifestyle, such as limiting foods associated with gout, should be initiated in anyone who has had gouty attacks. Treatment of gout with medications is necessary when frequent disabling gouty attacks occur, when kidney stones caused by uric acid are present, when there is evidence of joint damage from gout on ''X-rays'', or when tophi are present. Treatment should be individualized to the patient.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for gout?,"'When gout is mild, infrequent, and uncomplicated, it can be treated with ''diet'' and lifestyle changes. However, studies have shown that even the most rigorous ''diet'' does not lower the serum uric acid enough to control severe gout, and therefore medications are generally necessary. When attacks are frequent, uric acid kidney stones have occurred, tophi are present, or there is evidence of joint damage from gout attacks, medications are typically used to lower the uric acid blood level.''Medications for the treatment of gout generally fall into one of three categories: uric-acid-lowering medications, prophylactic medications (medications used in conjunction with uric-acid-lowering medications to prevent a gout flare), and rescue medications to provide immediate relief from gout pain.''Urate-lowering medications are the primary treatment for gout. These medications decrease the total amount of uric acid in the body and lower the serum uric acid level. For most patients, the goal of uric-acid-lowering medication is to achieve a serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dl. These medications also are effective treatments to decrease the size of tophi, with the ultimate goal of eradicating them. Uric-acid-lowering medications include allopurinol (Zyloprim, Aloprim), ''febuxostat'' (''Uloric''), ''probenecid'', and pegloticase (Krystexxa).''Prophylactic medications are used during approximately the first six months of therapy with a medication to lower high levels of uric acid to either prevent gout flares or decrease the number and severity of flares. This is because any medication or intervention that either increases or decreases the uric acid level in the bloodstream can trigger a gout attack. ''Colcrys'' (''colchicine'') and any of the ''NSAIDs'' (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'') such as ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin'', ''Indocin-SR''), ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren'', ''Cataflam'', Voltaren-XR, ''Cambia''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or ''naproxen'' sodium (''Aleve'') are frequently used as prophylactic medications to prevent gout flares during uric-acid lowering. By taking one of these prophylactic or preventative medications during the first six months of treatment with allopurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid, the risk of having a gout attack during this time is decreased. Prophylactic medications are not used in combination with Krystexxa.''The third category of medications are those used during attacks of acute gout to decrease pain and inflammation. Both colchicine (Colcrys) and NSAIDs can be used during an acute gout attack to decrease inflammation and pain. ''Corticosteroids'' such as ''prednisone'', ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol''), and ''prednisolone'' (''Orapred''), also can be used during an acute gouty flare. However, the total dose of steroids is generally limited due to potential side effects such as ''cataract'' formation and bone loss. Steroid medications are extremely helpful in treating gout flares in patients who are unable to take colchicine or NSAIDs.''Home remedies for an acute gout attack include drinking plenty of water. ''Over-the-counter'' NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, ''Motrin'') and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can be used when there are no contra-indications, such as decreased kidney function or stomach ulcers.''Home remedies may be very beneficial for the management of chronic gout, as well. The dietary modifications detailed above can be very effective in certain patients. Drinking plenty of water to remain well-hydrated can be beneficial in preventing gout attacks.'  "
Do gout medications have any side effects?," Gout medications are well tolerated by most people. However, like other medications, they have potential side effects. Allopurinol is well tolerated by most people, but in some people, it can cause an allergic rash. Very severe rashes rarely can occur after taking allopurinol, and any allergic type rashes that develop while a patient is taking allopurinol are taken seriously. Colchicine (Colcrys) can cause signs and symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and rarely muscle weakness and abnormal blood counts. Probenecid is generally well tolerated but should not be used in patients who have uric acid kidney stones, as it can worsen the kidney stones and potentially harm the kidneys in these patients. Febuxostat (Uloric) can cause liver abnormalities, nausea, and rash. NSAIDs can cause irritation of the stomach and ulcers in some cases. The liver and the kidneys are periodically monitored in patients taking NSAIDs over the long term. Krystexxa is administered as an intravenous infusion. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in a minority of people receiving Krystexxa."
What foods should people with gout eliminate from their diet?,"'Uric acid is formed when proteins in the food we eat, called purines, are broken down. Therefore, there has been a great deal of interest in dietary management of gout by avoiding high-purine (purine-rich) foods. However, a diet very low in purines is extremely difficult to follow, because purines are a natural part of many healthy foods. Even when a diet very low in purines is followed strictly, the uric acid level in the bloodstream is only slightly lowered.''The following dietary principles are important in the management of gout:'   Gout is associated with obesity, and significant weight loss can dramatically improve the management of gout. A calorie-reduced diet is helpful for weight loss. A diet low in saturated fat, with increased protein and replacement of refined carbohydrates (for example, sugar, white bread, potatoes) with complex carbohydrates (such as vegetables and whole grains) reduces the serum uric acid. Decreased consumption of seafood and red meat. The consumption of low-fat dairy products decreases the risk of gout. Drinking beer and liquor increase the risk of gout. However, drinking wine does not appear to increase the risk of gout. In one study, consumption of fresh cherries was associated with a 35% decreased risk of gout. Some people believe that black cherry juice or dried cherries have the same effect, but this has not been proven. Drinking beverages sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup increases the risk of gout."
What complications are associated with gout?,"'Longstanding untreated gout can cause irreversible joint damage.''Uric acid can deposit in the kidneys and cause kidney stones and decreased kidney function.''Uric acid can deposit in the soft tissues, especially around joints, and cause nodules known as tophi, which can be large and unsightly.' "
What is the prognosis of gout?,"'Gout is a chronic condition. Left untreated, patients may suffer from recurrent painful and disabling acute attacks of gout. Joint damage and other complications of gout may occur. However, excellent treatments for gout are available, and most patients respond very well to gout treatment with a good prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent gout?,"'Some of the risk factors for gout are genetic, and those are not preventable. However, many of the risk factors for gout, such as obesity and diet, are controllable. Maintaining a healthy weight and a diet low in refined carbohydrates and low in saturated fat and red meat may prevent gout.' "
What is the latest research on gout?,'Research is being done on using medications that block a chemical signal known as interleukin-1 to treat gout flares in patients who do not respond to other therapies. ''Anakinra'' (''Kineret'') and canakinumab (Ilaris) are two medications that block interleukin-1. They are currently used for other conditions and are under investigation for use in gout flare-ups.''There is ongoing research in using a specialized ''CT scan'' known as a dual energy CT scan to diagnose gout. There is also a great deal of research investigating the various uric acid transporter genes that are responsible for uric acid metabolism.' 
What is arthritis?,"'Painful ''joint swelling'' is called ''arthritis''. ''Osteoarthritis'' is due to wear and tear of the joints over many years. Arthritis maye develop in any joint, including the fingers, hips and knees. Usually, patients with arthritis feel ''pain'' in their joints even after moderate movements. The cartilage (a rubbery tissue covering the ends of the bones) breaks down over time, leaving the bones without cushions. This causes the bones to rub against each other resulting in painful swelling. Arthritis is a very painful condition that does not have a cure. However, there are lots of treatment options available to curb the complications of arthritis.\xa0' "
What are the four stages of osteoarthritis in the knees?,"'People who have immense ''osteoarthritis'' ''pain'' may only show mild changes on X-ray, so it is important to concentrate on the symptoms rather than just the X-ray. Below are the stages of osteoarthritis of the knee with appropriate treatment plans.''Stage 0 or Normal:''Stage 1 or Minor:''Stage 2 or Mild:''Stage 3 or Moderate:''Stage 4 or Severe:' When the knee shows no signs of osteoarthritis, it is classified as stage 0.  There is no treatment required for stage 0 osteoarthritis. In this stage, patients may develop very minor wear and tear and bone spur growths at the end of the knee joints.  Usually, patients may not feel pain or any discomfort. This stage is usually diagnosed as an incidental finding or during a regular health checkup. Physicians may not recommend any special treatment for stage 1. However, supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin may be recommended. Lifestyle considerations such as regular exercise and weight loss may also prove to be helpful. In stage 2, diagnostic images or X-rays of knee joints will show more bone spur growth, although the space between the bones appears normal. Patients usually visit the doctor during this stage due to joint pain or discomfort. Typically, the area around the knee joints will feel stiff and uncomfortable, particularly when sitting for an extended period, after rising in the morning or after a workout. In this stage, the cartilage and soft tissues may remain healthy. There are different nonpharmacologic therapies to help relieve the pain and discomfort caused in this mild stage. Many patients are recommended a strict regimen of exercise and strength training to increase joint stability. Additionally, braces, knee supports or shoe inserts may be used to protect the knee from stress. In this stage, there is obvious erosion of the cartilage surface between the bones and fibrillation narrows the gap between the bones. The bones develop spurs at the joints as they become rougher. There may be obvious joint swelling that causes frequent pain when walking, running, squatting, extending or kneeling. Along with joint stiffness after sitting for long periods of time or when waking up in the morning, there may be popping or snapping sounds when walking. Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or pain-relief therapies may be prescribed. If these methods are not effective, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medicine, such as codeine and oxycodone. Patients who have not responded positively to physical therapy, a weight loss program and use of NSAIDs may require visco-supplementation, which is intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid into the knee joint. Moderate knee arthritis can be treated aggressively with three to five injections of hyaluronic acid over three to five weeks’ time. It may take several weeks for the treatment to start showing results, but pain relief typically lasts six months. In stage 4, the joint space between the bones is considerably reduced, causing the cartilage to wear off and leaving the joint stiff. The breakdown of cartilage leads to a severe swelling response with decreased joint fluid that causes friction, greater pain and discomfort when walking or moving the joint. Soft tissue destruction may be noted around the knees in this stage. The development of more spurs causes excruciating pain, which makes even daily activities difficult. Treatment options include osteotomy or bone realignment surgery. The surgeon cuts the bone above or below the knee to shorten the length and help realign it to reduce stress on the knee joint. This surgery helps protect the knee by shifting the weight of the body away from the site of the bone spur growth and bone damage. Total knee replacement or arthroplasty: During this surgical procedure, the damaged joint is removed and replaced with a plastic or metal prosthesis device.  Recovery from surgery may take several weeks and requires patience and discipline with continuous physical and occupational therapy to regain full mobility."
Facts you should know about septic arthritis (infectious arthritis)," Septic arthritis is infection of one or more joints by microorganisms. Septic arthritis can be caused by fungal, viral, and bacterial infections. Risks for the development of septic arthritis include a patient taking immune-suppression medicines, intravenous drug abuse, past joint disease, injury or surgery, and underlying medical illnesses, including diabetes, alcoholism, sickle cell disease, rheumatic diseases, and immune deficiency disorders. With septic arthritis, patients may experience symptoms and signs that includefever,chills, as well asjoint pain,swelling,redness,stiffness, andwarmth. fever, chills, as well as joint pain, swelling, redness, stiffness, and warmth. By identifying infected joint fluid, doctors may make a diagnosis of this type of arthritis. Septic arthritis treatment requires a patient to take antibiotics and a health care professional to drain the infected joint fluid from the joint."
What is septic arthritis?,"""Septic, or infectious, arthritis is infection of one or more joints by microorganisms. Normally, the joint is lubricated with a small amount of fluid that is referred to as synovial fluid or joint fluid. The normal joint fluid is sterile and, if removed and cultured in the laboratory, no microbes will be detected. With this form of arthritis, microbes are identifiable in an affected joint's fluid.""'Most commonly, infectious arthritis affects a single joint, but occasionally more joints are involved. The joints affected vary somewhat depending on the microbe causing the infection and the predisposing risk factors of the patient affected. Septic arthritis is also called infectious arthritis.'  "
What microbes cause septic arthritis?,"'Septic arthritis can be caused by bacteria, ''viruses'', and fungi. The most common causes of septic arthritis are bacterial, including ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (''staph'') and ''Haemophilus influenzae''. In certain ""high-risk"" individuals, other bacteria may cause septic arthritis, such as ''E. coli'' and ''Pseudomonas'' spp.'' in intravenous drug abusers and the elderly, ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' in sexually active young adults, and ''Salmonella'' spp.'' in young children or in people with sickle cell disease. Other bacteria that can cause septic arthritis include ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'' and the spirochete bacterium that causes ''Lyme disease''.''Viruses that can cause septic arthritis include ''hepatitis A'', B, and C, parvovirus B19, ''herpes'' viruses, ''HIV'' (''AIDS'' virus), HTLV-1, ''adenovirus'', Coxsackieviruses, ''mumps'', and ''Ebola''. Fungi that can cause septic arthritis include ''Histoplasma'', ''Coccidioides'', and ''Blastomyces''.' "
Is septic arthritis contagious?,"'Septic arthritis is not ''contagious''. However, many of the microbes that cause infectious arthritis can be transmitted from an infected patient to another, including ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Staphylococcus'' aureus'', ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'', and ''HIV''.' "
Who is at risk of developing septic arthritis?,"'While joint infection occasionally affects people with no known predisposing risk factors, it more commonly occurs when certain risk situations are present. Risks for the development of septic arthritis include taking medications that suppress the immune system, intravenous ''drug abuse'', past joint disease, injury, or surgery, and underlying medical conditions and diseases including ''diabetes'', alcoholism, sickle cell disease, rheumatic diseases (for example, ''rheumatoid arthritis''), and immune deficiency disorders. People with any of these conditions who develop symptoms of septic arthritis should promptly seek medical attention.' "
What are symptoms and signs of septic arthritis?,"'Clinical symptoms of septic arthritis include ''fever'', chills, as well as joint ''pain'', swelling, redness, stiffness, and warmth. Joint ''pain'' most commonly affects large joints, such as the knees, ankles, hips, and elbows. In patients with risk factors for joint infection, unusual joints can be infected, including the joint where the collarbone (clavicle) meets the breastbone (sternum). With uncommon microbes, such as ''Brucella spp.'', atypical joints can be infected, such as the sacroiliac joints.'  "
Which health care professionals specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis?,"'Septic arthritis is a medical emergency. Doctors who treat septic arthritis include emergency physicians, internists, ''rheumatologists'', orthopedists, infectious disease physicians, and rehabilitation-medicine providers.' "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of septic arthritis?,"'Health care professionals make a diagnosis of septic arthritis by identifying infected joint fluid. During an ''arthrocentesis'' (''joint aspiration''), synovial fluid can easily be removed from the joint space of a patient in an office, hospital, or clinical setting with a needle and syringe. The synovial fluid is analyzed in a laboratory to determine if there is an elevated number of white blood cells to suggest inflammation. A culture of the synovial fluid can identify the particular microbe and determine its susceptibility to a variety of antibiotics.''X-ray studies of the joint can be helpful to detect injury of bone adjacent to the joint. ''MRI'' scanning is very sensitive in evaluating joint destruction. Blood tests are frequently used to detect and monitor inflammation. These tests include the white blood cell count, ''sedimentation rate'', and ''C-reactive protein''.'  "
What is the treatment for septic arthritis?,"'Treatment of septic arthritis includes antibiotic therapy and drainage of the infected joint (synovial) fluid from the joint (arthrocentesis).''Optimally, antibiotics are given immediately. Often, health care professionals administer intravenous antibiotics in a hospital setting. The choice of antibiotics can be guided by the results of the culture of joint fluid. Until those results are known, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wider range of possible infectious agents. Sometimes, combinations of antibiotics are given. Antibiotics may be required for four to six weeks.''Drainage is essential for rapid clearing of the infection. Drainage of a joint effusion can be done by regular aspirations with a needle and syringe, often daily early on, or via surgical procedures. ''Arthroscopy'' can be used to irrigate the joint and remove infected joint lining tissue. If adequate drainage cannot be accomplished with joint aspirations or arthroscopy, open joint surgery is used to drain the joint. After arthroscopy or open joint surgery, drains are sometimes left in place to drain excess fluid that can accumulate after the procedure.'  "
Are there home remedies for septic arthritis?,'No. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency and requires acute treatment by an appropriate medical team.' 
What are complications of septic arthritis?,"'Rapid clearing of the infection is critical to preserve the joint. If appropriate antibiotics are begun immediately, joint integrity can be maintained, and return to function is expected. If the infection has been longstanding, the possibility of joint destruction exists. The keys to successful outcome are rapid medical attention and drainage and the accurate administration of antibiotics to which the offending microbes are susceptible.' "
What is the prognosis of septic arthritis?,"'The outlook for septic arthritis depends on the precise microbe causing the infection, the duration of the infection, and the underlying overall health of the individual infected. Some types of microorganisms are more aggressive and difficult to treat than others. The longer the infection is present, the more opportunity for damage to affect the joint. People whose immune systems are not functioning optimally are also at risk for more joint damage. Moreover, if septic arthritis leads to infection in other parts of the body, other organs can be affected.' "
Is it possible to prevent septic arthritis?,"'It is possible to prevent septic arthritis by avoiding infections, ''puncture wounds'', and damage to the skin.' "
What is juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Juvenile ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (JRA) is the umbrella term under which several forms of chronic ''arthritis'' in children are categorized. Regardless of type, all of these conditions have several historical and/or clinical characteristics in common. One or more joints must demonstrate evidence of inflammation characterized by ''swollen joints'', limitation in the range of motion of the involved joint(s), tenderness when the joint is moved, and increased warmth of the joint region. These symptoms must be present (even intermittently) for at least six weeks and affect a child less than 16 years of age.''JRA is the most frequent chronic rheumatologic disease of childhood, and the cause(s) are not well understood. Both environmental and genetic influences are felt to contribute to the development of signs and symptoms of JRA. Knowledgeable specialists (pediatric ''rheumatologists'' usually affiliated with pediatric teaching hospitals) can help to limit the possibility of complications of juvenile ''rheumatoid arthritis'' including leg-length discrepancy, joint contractures, and destruction and ''blindness'' due to inflammation of the eye (''iritis'').''Until the late 1990s, JIA was known in the U.S. as JRA (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) and JCA (juvenile chronic arthritis) in Europe. The revised name was devised in order to better distinguish the childhood disease from rheumatoid arthritis (''RA'') that affects adults. This new nomenclature has enabled the categorization of six JIA subtypes. This updated classification has helped to foster better communication among those doing research on causation, clinical manifestations, and therapy of JIA.'""JRA is considered a diagnosis of exclusion; the diagnosis can only be confidently made when (1) the patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory findings are consistent with those described in the literature by the International League of Associations for ""'Rheumatology'' and (2) other conditions have been excluded. These include infection, ''malignancy'', ''trauma'', ''reactive arthritis'', immunodeficiency, and other connective tissue/rheumatologic diseases (for example, ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').' "
What are the types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'There are six broad categories of JRA. These include''The specific criteria necessary to establish a diagnosis and prognosis for each category are detailed below.' systemic onset 
	JRA, oligoarticular JRA (containing two subgroups), polyarticular 
	JRA (containing two subgroups), psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis."
What are causes and risk factors of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) arthritis?,"'While no specific cause(s) of JRA have been determined, there is strong evidence of both genetic and environmental factors being implicated in the development of the disease. Studies of the frequency of JRA have shown that if one identical twin develops the disease that the likelihood of their identical sibling developing JRA is 25%-40%. Studies of nonidentical siblings show evidence that if one child develops JRA there is a 15 to 30 times increased risk that a sibling will develop the condition when compared to the general pediatric population.''The biologic and clinical manifestations of JRA provide strong evidence that a general theme of an immune system misdirection is evident. The immune system has two ""arms"" -- the cell based (lymphocytes, etc.) and humeral based (antibodies). Rheumatologists have demonstrated that both of these elements of the immune system react against the patient\'s own body structures (joints, muscles, eye tissues, etc.). Much research is currently focused in an effort to better understand this auto-inflammatory process in the hope that understanding the cause of JRA will enable better and more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for the condition.' "
What specialists treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Members of the treatment team would include a pediatric ''rheumatologist'', a pediatric ophthalmologist, physical and occupational therapists, a pharmacologist, and a social worker/family counselor.' "
"What are juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) symptoms and signs, and how are the different types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) diagnosed?","'The International League of Associations of Rheumatology has classified JRA into six distinct patterns that vary by clinical presentation and evolution of symptoms, laboratory implications, potential complications, and therapeutic options. While some similarities exist among these diseases, the uniqueness of each manifestation of JRA is strong enough to justify the breakdown into the six patterns. One characteristic common to all six forms of JRA is that of ""morning ''stiffness''"" that improves during the day as more movement is done. Likewise, spontaneous patterns of worsening and lessening of symptoms (which may be independent of therapy) is characteristic.''1. ''Systemic onset JRA'': By definition, systemic onset JRA must have arthritis (swelling, ''pain'', and warmth) of one or more joints associated with a minimum of two weeks of daily spiking ''fevers''. The ''fever'' is often greater than 102 F (39 C) and usually spikes once or twice a day and may have the unique pattern of returning to below normal between rises. In addition, a characteristic intermittent salmon-colored ''rash'';\xa0''swollen lymph nodes'', ''liver'', and spleen; and inflammation of the ''lungs'', the pericardium (the ""sack"" surrounding the ''heart''), and other organs may occur. During febrile episodes, children appear moderately sick, but with resolution of ''fever'' they are much improved. Systemic onset JRA affects approximately 10%-15% all children suffering from JRA. There is no gender preference (the frequency in boys and girls is equal), with symptoms generally starting between 3-5 years of age. There is no unique laboratory test for JRA, but children typically have ''anemia'' and elevation of white blood cell and platelet counts, as well as alterations of general markers of inflammation. Complications of systemic onset JRA may include slower than expected growth, weakening of bones, abnormalities of liver and lung function, and consequences of therapy (see below). The prognosis is generally noted to depend upon the severity of arthritis with many/most of the systemic symptoms resolving over months to years. The low mortality rate (<0.3% in North America) is reassuring. Since the diagnosis of systemic onset of JRA is one of exclusion, the possibility of infection, malignancy, ''collagen vascular disease'', and ''rheumatic fever'' must also be considered.''2. ''Oligoarticular JRA'': Oligoarticular is defined as arthritis that affects four or fewer joints in the first six months of the disease. This form of JRA accounts for about 50% of all cases of pediatric chronic arthritis and may be subdivided into two groups. One group consists of those children who continue throughout the entire course of their disease having four or fewer joints involved. The other group eventually develops greater than four-joint involvement after the first six months of illness. The onset of disease is between 2-4 years of age with a female gender bias of approximately 3:1. Children with oligoarticular JRA most commonly have a single large joint (knee in approximately 90% of cases) involvement. Symptoms of ''joint pain'' and tenderness are worse in the morning in association with the previously described morning stiffness (see systemic onset JRA). The primary complication of oligoarticular JRA is inflammation of the ''iris'' (the colored region of the eye). Iritis is found in approximately 15%-20% with this form of JRA and is often without symptoms. Complications of iritis may include clouding of the ''cornea'' (''cataracts''), ''glaucoma'', and ''vision loss''. Since outcome is linked to early diagnosis, it is imperative an ophthalmologist evaluate children with oligoarticular JRA every three to four months. Conditions that should be eliminated prior to establishing a diagnosis of oligoarticular JRA include trauma, infection, malignancy, and arthritis following an infection.''3. ''Polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'': Children who have five or more joints involved with arthritis during the first six months of their disease are classified into the polyarticular JRA form of illness. Two subgroups of polyarticular JRA exist based upon a constellation of various laboratory studies. One group (rheumatoid factor ""RF"" positive) affects between 5%-10% of all patients with JRA. Late childhood through young teenage girls are the most likely to develop this pattern. Generally, small joints (such as the hands and ''feet'') tend to be involved, and a more aggressive course has been observed. ""RF negative"" polyarticular JRA affected individuals tend to have a milder course and thus a better outcome. ''Fatigue'', ''anemia'', suboptimal growth, and iritis (to a lesser degree than oligoarticular JRA) are complications. Other conditions that must be considered and eliminated prior to establishing the diagnosis of polyarticular JRA include infection, malignancy, and collagen ''vascular disease'' (including ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').''4. ''Psoriatic arthritis'' (PsA)'': Establishing the diagnosis of ''psoriatic arthritis'' involves demonstration of both large and small joint arthritis and a characteristic ''rash'' (''psoriasis''). Should the rash not be present, two of the following must exist: (a) family history of ''psoriasis'' in an immediate family member, (b) diffuse swelling of the fingers, and (c) pitting of the nails. Children with psoriatic arthritis may also develop iritis and should have ophthalmologic evaluation every six months.''5. ''Enthesitis''-related arthritis (ERA)'': Enthesitis (inflammation at the site of tendon insertion on the bone) most profoundly affects males over 8 years of age and often involves the lower back, sacroiliac joints, and joints of the legs, ankles, and feet. Patients with a particular genetic marker (HLA-B27) may also develop iritis, ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''psoriasis'', and/or ''ankylosing spondylitis'' (inflammation of the pelvic joints -- most commonly the sacroiliac region). The male to female ratio is 7:1.''6. ''Undifferentiated arthritis'': Children who either do not fit clearly into the above unique subtypes of JRA or who have symptoms/laboratory studies that overlap more than one subtype are classified as having undifferentiated arthritis. By their nature, the patient population with this form of JRA often presents with nonclassical history and/or findings on physical exam and laboratory studies.

What is the treatment for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)? What medications treat JRA?,"'While there currently is no cure for JRA, an integrated and coordinated approach has been shown to be helpful in lessening the morbidity (nonlethal side effects) of JRA. Goals include lessening ''pain'', joint contractures, and growth disturbances (see above). Monitoring for the development of iritis and aggressive treatment are also paramount. Often patients are best served at a pediatric teaching hospital where access to pediatric rheumatologists, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacologists, and social support providers may allow ""one stop shopping.""''Therapies for JRA patients include the following:''1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly used as the first line of therapy due to their positive effect of reducing inflammation in arthritis and relatively few side effects. Medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), and ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin'') are examples of this class of therapy.''2. Steroids are another common class of medications for those experiencing moderate to severe arthritis or nonarthritis inflammatory consequences of JRA. These medications may be administered orally (''prednisone'' [''Deltasone''], ''prednisolone'' [''Pediapred'']), intravenously (''methylprednisolone'' [''Solu-Medrol''], ''dexamethasone'' [Decadron], hydrocortisone [''Solu-Cortef'']), or injected directly into an involved joint (methylprednisolone [''Depo-Medrol''], triamcinolone [Kenalog]). Side effects of steroids may be considerable, and pediatric rheumatologists strive to use the lowest possible dosage. Side effects are most commonly seen at dosages over 20 mg/day and may include immune system ''depression'', ''increased appetite'' resulting in ''weight gain'', ''acne'', ''mood changes'', ''osteoporosis'', ''bruising'', ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and ''diabetes''.''3. Antirheumatic medications (also known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs) are needed in approximately two-thirds of children to control the joint changes and prevent damage of JRA. These medications are generally considered when the medications previously described are not providing effective control of the illness. Medicines in this category include ''methotrexate'' (''Trexall''), now considered the ""gold standard"" for JRA, ''sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'', ''Neoral''), and others. These medications are administered orally or intravenously. Antirheumatic medications are more potent in effect but also can have significant side effects. All of these medications require regular blood testing to monitor for side effects. Problems include immune suppression, which may cause an increased risk of infection, certain ''cancers'', bone marrow toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, ''liver function'' abnormalities, ''abdominal pain'', and decrease in appetite.''4. Biologic agents can lessen the morbidity for children with JRA. These agents are administered either by superficial injection under the skin or intravenously. Their general chemical classification is that of ""monoclonal antibodies"" that work by accurately targeting various mechanisms of the immune system that are overactive and misdirected in JRA. They are associated with an increased risk of infections and (rarely) development of certain malignancies. As such, close clinical monitoring and various laboratory studies are required. Examples of ''biologics'' used in the treatment of JRA include ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''anakinra'' (''Kineret''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''tocilizumab'' (''Actemra''), and ''abatacept'' (''Orencia'').'""5. Autologous stem cell transplantation is reserved only for those children with JRA who have failed the above therapeutic options. This procedure requires hospitalization and is a two-step process. The initial goal is utilization of high-dose immune suppression medications to remove the patient's lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that are attacking the patient's joint(s). Once removed, new ""'stem cells'"" from the patient (autologous) that were previously harvested and treated are introduced back into the patient's body via the bloodstream. This process requires expertise found only in a few pediatric referral centers.""  "
What are complications of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Perhaps the most insidious and most devastating complication of JRA is a form of eye inflammation of the iris of the eye called iritis. The risk for iritis is variable depending upon the subtype of JRA. The highest risk group is oligoarticular JRA while patients with systemic onset JRA are at a low risk of this complication. It is imperative that all JRA patients have thorough ophthalmologic examinations in order to detect any changes that would herald the onset of iritis.''Another common complication of JRA is growth disturbances (such as a difference in leg lengths). Interestingly, the involved joint (such as the knee) has an increase in blood flow due to the inflammatory nature of the local arthritis. This increase in blood flow encourages the area of bone growth (growth plate) to maximum activity and thus the involved leg is longer than the non-involved limb. However, as the disease progresses, the chronic nature of arthritis can damage the growth plate region causing premature fusion and thus the involved leg will be retarded relative to the uninvolved limb. Many patients experience moderate pain of the joints involved resulting in limited use of the region. As a result, loss of calcium from the bone can result in ''osteoporosis''.''These children and their parents may also fall victim to emotional ''stress'' associated with any chronic illness. Long-term low-grade pain may stimulate a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and thus ''depression''. Children often have a limited social life (especially with their peers) due to school absenteeism.''It must also be remembered that the medical therapies commonly used to treat JRA can have many have prominent side effects (see above).' "
What is the prognosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Approximately 50% of children with JRA continue to have active disease into adulthood. In patients who have active disease into adulthood, there can be significant disability with functional limitations. Outcome may reflect duration of disease, presence of polyarticular involvement, and the need for systemic steroids. In the United States and Canada, death is rare (29 out of 10,000 patients) and is most likely with systemic onset JRA.' "
What is Lyme disease? What causes Lyme disease?,"'A bacterium called a ""spirochete"" causes Lyme disease, a ''tick-borne disease''. In the United States, the actual name of the bacteria are ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' and ''Borrelia mayonii''. In Europe, the bacteria ''Borrelia afzelii'' and ''Borrelia garinii'' also cause Lyme disease. Certain ticks (''Ixodes scapularis'') frequently found on deer, particularly white-tailed deer, from various locations harbor the bacterium in their stomachs. Dr. Burgdorfer originally discovered the spiral-shaped bacterium in the gut of the ticks in the United States, hence the naming ''Borrelia burgdorferi''. ''Lyme borreliosis is spread by these infected ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the transmission of the ''Borrelia'' spirochete through the skin to infect the body. So Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease. Lyme disease is not ''contagious'' from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system. Borreliosis, a tick-borne disease, is an infectious disease that is reportable to the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' in the United States.'  "
What is the history of Lyme disease?,"'Interestingly, the disease only became apparent in 1975 when mothers of a group of children who lived near each other in Lyme, Conn., made researchers aware that their children had all been diagnosed with ''joint pain'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis''. This unusual grouping of illness that appeared ""rheumatoid"" eventually led researchers to the identification of the bacterial cause of the children\'s condition, what was then named ""Lyme disease"" in 1982.''The only vector for Lyme disease in the U.S. is the black-legged tick, or deer tick, known as ''Ixodes scapularis''. These ticks are carriers of the Lyme disease spirochete in their stomachs; ''Ixodes'' ticks may also transmit ''Powassan'' virus. The ticks then are vectors that can transmit the bacterium to humans with a tick bite. The number of cases of the tick-borne illness in an area depends on the number of ticks present and how often the ticks are infected with the bacteria. In certain areas of New York, where Lyme disease is common, over half of the ticks are infected. Lyme disease has been reported most often in the northeastern United States, but it has been reported in all 50 states, as well as China, Europe, Japan, Australia, and parts of the former Soviet Union. In the United States, it is primarily contracted in the Northeast in the states from Maine to Maryland, in the Midwest in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and in the West in Oregon and Northern California. What those children actually had was Lyme ''arthritis''.' "
What are risk factors for developing Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease occurs most frequently in children 5-14 years of age and adults 40-50 years of age. The most substantial risk factor for Lyme disease is exposure to the ticks located in the high-risk areas of the country listed above, particularly in the New England states, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin. Additional risk factors include recreational and occupational exposure to ticks and outdoor activities, including gardening, in woods, and fields in the high-risk areas. No transplacental transmission (congenital infection) of Lyme disease from the mother to the unborn child has ever been described. Again, Lyme disease is not contagious from one person to another.' "
What are Lyme disease symptoms and signs?,"'Lyme disease affects different areas of the body in varying degrees as it progresses. The site where the tick bites the skin is where the bacteria enter the body through the skin. Days to weeks later, as the bacteria spread in the skin away from the initial tick bite, the tick-borne infection causes an expanding reddish ''rash'' that is often associated with ""''flu-like''"" symptoms. Later, it can produce abnormalities in the joints, heart, and nervous system.''Lyme disease is medically described in three phases (stages) as: (1) early localized disease with ''skin inflammation'' and ''rash''; (2) early disseminated disease with heart and nervous system involvement, including palsies and meningitis; and (3) late disease featuring motor and sensory nerve damage and brain inflammation, as well as arthritis.''In the early phase of the illness, within days to weeks of the tick bite, the skin around the bite develops an expanding ring of unraised redness. There may be an outer ring of brighter redness with or without a central area of clearing, leading to a ""bull\'s-eye"" appearance. This classic initial rash is called ""''erythema migrans''"" (formerly called erythema chronicum migrans). Patients often can\'t recall the tick bite (the ticks can be as small as the periods in this paragraph). Also, they may not have the identifying rash to signal the doctor. The rash may or may not ''itch''. More than one in four patients never even develop a rash. The redness of the skin is often accompanied by generalized ''fatigue'', muscle and joint ''pain'' and ''stiffness'', ''swollen lymph nodes'' (""swollen glands""), ''headache'', and less often ''fever'', resembling symptoms of a viral infection.''The redness resolves, without treatment, in about a month. Weeks to months after the initial redness of the skin, the bacteria and their effects spread throughout the body. Subsequently, disease in the joints, heart, and nervous system can occur.''The later phases of Lyme borreliosis can affect the heart, causing inflammation of the heart muscle. This can result in ''abnormal heart rhythms'' and ''heart failure''. The nervous system signs can include facial muscle ''paralysis'"" (Bell's palsy), abnormal sensation due to disease of peripheral nerves (""'peripheral neuropathy''), meningitis, and ''confusion''. Arthritis, or inflammation in the joints, begins with swelling, stiffness, and ''pain''. Usually, only one or a few joints become affected, most commonly the knees. Lyme arthritis can look like many other types of inflammatory arthritis and can become chronic.''Researchers have also found that ''anxiety'' and ''depression'' occur with an increased rate in people with Lyme disease. This is another important aspect of the evaluation and management of this condition.'  "
What types of doctors treat Lyme disease?,"'Doctors who are involved in the treatment of Lyme disease include primary care physicians (including pediatricians, family medicine doctors, and internists), as well as specialists in infectious disease, ''rheumatology'', and neurology.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose Lyme disease?,"""In early Lyme disease, doctors can sometimes make a diagnosis simply by finding the classic red rash (described above), particularly in people who have recently been in regions in which Lyme disease is common. The doctor might review the patient's history and examine the patient in order to exclude diseases with similar findings in the joints, heart, and nervous system.""'Blood tests for antibodies to Lyme bacteria are generally not necessary or helpful in early stage disease, but it can help in diagnosis in later stages. (Antibodies are produced by the body to attack the bacteria and can be evidence of exposure to the bacteria. These antibodies can be detected using a laboratory method called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [''ELISA''].) Antibodies, however, can be false indicators of disease, since they can persist for years after the disease is cured. Moreover, false-positive tests in patients with nonspecific findings (those that are not specifically suggestive of Lyme disease) can lead to confusion. Currently, the confirmatory test that is most reliable is the Western Blot assay antibody test. More accurate tests are being developed. Both the ELISA test and the Western Blot tests are analyses of blood samples to test for Lyme disease.''Generally, Lyme blood testing is helpful in a patient who has symptoms compatible with Lyme disease, who has a history of a tick bite at least a month prior, or who has unexplained disorders of the heart, joints, or nervous system that are characteristic of Lyme disease.'  "
Is Lyme disease curable? What is the prognosis of Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. This is so true that some authors of Lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of Lyme disease to antibiotic therapy is a lack of Lyme disease to begin with! The type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. Early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin''), ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil''), or ''cefuroxime'' axetil (''Ceftin''). This antibiotic therapy generally result in a rapid cure of Lyme disease. Of note, doxycycline should not be used in ''pregnancy'' or in children under 8 years of age.'""Therefore, if a person finds a typical bull's-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. Later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous ""'drugs''; examples are ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and ''penicillin'' G. There are no home remedies to treat Lyme disease.''In those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrans rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection.''For relief of ''Lyme disease symptoms'', pain-relieving medicines might be added. ''Swollen joints'' can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (''arthrocentesis'""). An arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It is usually performed in a doctor's office. Rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. It has been suggested by researchers that sometimes ""'joint inflammation'' can persist even after eradication of the Lyme bacteria. This complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. Oral medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Nuprin'') can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. There is no evidence that nonspecific ''fatigue'' that persists after treatment for Lyme disease is related to persistent infection. The risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation.''Of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent ''symptoms of Lyme disease'' led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. The study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. Specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on ''fatigue'', or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from Lyme disease than placebo.'  "
 What are complications of Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease can be complicated by permanent damage to joints, the heart, the brain, and the nervous system. There is recent research that demonstrates an increased risk for autoimmune forms of arthritis, including ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and peripheral spondyloarthropathy, as a result of chronic Lyme disease (or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [PTLDS]), even after treatment.' "
Is it possible to prevent Lyme disease? Is there a Lyme disease vaccine?,"'Avoiding known tick-infested areas obviously can prevent transmission of Lyme disease. Because ticks transmit Lyme disease by attaching to the body, it is important to use tick-bite avoidance techniques when visiting endemic areas for ticks. Spraying insect repellant containing DEET onto exposed skin can help to keep ticks off of skin and clothes. Wearing long pants tucked into boots and long sleeves can protect the skin. Clothing, children, and pets should be examined for ticks. Ticks can be removed gently with tweezers and saved in a jar for later identification. Bathing the skin and ''scalp'' and washing clothing upon returning home might prevent the bite and transmission of the disease.''If a person is bitten by the classic deer tick (''Ixodes'') that has been attached for at least 36 hours, a single dose of doxycycline (200 mg) can be very helpful for prevention of Lyme disease. This therapy is not recommended if the tick is acquired in an area where these ticks are not commonly infested (infection rate less than 20%) with the bacterium (''Borrelia'') that causes Lyme disease. Also, doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy or in children under 8 years of age.''Vaccines'' for the prevention of Lyme disease were formerly on the market but have not been commercially available since 2002. Further studies of ''vaccines'' are needed. For now, ideal prevention focuses on the recommendations above.' "

What are connective tissues?,"'The connective tissues are the structural portions of our body that essentially hold the cells of the body together. These tissues form a framework or matrix for the body. The connective tissues are composed of two major structural molecules, collagen and elastin. There are many different collagen proteins that vary in amount in each tissue of the body. Elastin is another protein that has the capability of stretching and returning to original length like a spring. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues which attach bone to bone).''Connective tissue diseases are disorders featuring abnormalities involving the collagen and elastin. Connective tissue diseases are often characterized by a variety of immune abnormalities that are common for each particular type of illness.' "
What diseases characteristically affect connective tissue?,"'Diseases of connective tissue that are strictly inheritable (due to genetic inheritance) include ''Marfan syndrome'' (can have tissue abnormalities in the ''heart'', ''aorta'', ''lungs'', eyes, and skeleton) and ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'' (may have loose, fragile skin or loose [hyperextensible] joints). ''Pseudoxanthoma elasticum'' is an ''inherited'' disorder of elastin.''Other diseases of connective tissue do not have specific gene abnormalities as their sole cause. These connective tissue diseases occur for unknown reasons. They are characterized as a group by the presence of spontaneous overactivity of the immune system, which results in the production of unusual antibodies in the blood.''The classic immune-related connective tissue diseases include ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''scleroderma'', ''polymyositis'', and ''dermatomyositis''. Each of these diseases has a characteristic presentation with typical clinical findings that doctors can recognize during an examination. Each also has characteristic blood test abnormalities and abnormal antibody patterns. However, each of these diseases can evolve slowly or rapidly from very subtle abnormalities before demonstrating the classic features that help in the diagnosis. When these conditions have not developed the classic features of a particular disease, doctors will often refer to the condition as ""undifferentiated connective tissue disease."" This implies that the characteristic features that are used to define the classic connective tissue disease are not present, but some symptoms or signs of connective disease exist. Individuals with undifferentiated connective tissue disease may never develop a fully definable condition or they may eventually develop a classic connective tissue disease.' "
What is mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Mixed connective tissue disease, as first described in 1972, is ""classically"" considered an ""overlap"" of three diseases, systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Patients with this pattern illness have features of each of these three diseases. They also typically have very high quantities of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) detectable in their blood. The symptoms of many of these patients eventually evolve to become dominated by features of one of three component illnesses, most commonly scleroderma. Mixed connective tissue disease is often abbreviated MCTD.''It is now known that overlap syndromes can occur that involve any combination of the connective tissue diseases. Therefore, for example, patients can have a combination of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus (hence, the coined name ""rhupus"").' "
What are causes and risk factors for mixed connective tissue disease?,'The most significant causes and risk factors for developing mixed connective tissue disease are certain gene patterns that are inherited from ancestors. There is no known environmental toxin that has been shown to cause mixed connective tissue disease.' 
What are signs and symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease?,"'The signs and symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease vary greatly from one individual affected to another. If polymyositis is the dominant feature, muscle ''weakness'' is prominent. If systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus prevails, there may be ''chest pain'' with ''breathing'', ''kidney disease'', and/or ''arthritis'' of the joints. If scleroderma symptoms dominate, there can be diffuse swelling and thickening of the fingers and ''feet'' with bluish discoloration of the fingers after ''cold'' exposure ('""Raynaud's""' phenomenon).'  "
What types of doctors treat mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Doctors who treat patients with mixed connective tissue disease include primary-care providers such as general practitioners, internists, and family medicine doctors. Other specialists who can be involved in the care for these patients include neurologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and nephrologists. Specialists with a particular interest in mixed connective tissue disease are ''rheumatologists''.' "
How do doctors diagnose mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Today, true mixed connective tissue disease is diagnosed when patients demonstrate the clinical features (exam findings) of overlap illnesses (as described above) and have high amounts of the antibodies ANA and anti-RNP in their blood. Mixed connective tissue disease patients do not typically have antibodies such as dsDNA and Scl70, which are particularly common in systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus and scleroderma respectively.' "
What are treatment options for mixed connective tissue disease?,"'The treatment of mixed connective tissue disease is based on which features are causing symptoms and signs. The prognosis (outlook) varies accordingly. Therapies must be targeted for each of the organ systems affected. In general, treatment is often directed at suppressing the inflammation present in the tissues by using anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications. These medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), cortisone drugs/steroids (such as ''prednisone''), antimalarial drugs (''hydroxychloroquine''), and cytotoxic drugs (such as ''methotrexate'', ''azathioprine'', and ''cyclophosphamide''). Organ damage, such as in the kidneys, can require additional treatments directed at ''high blood pressure'', etc.''For the joint and muscle pains of mixed connective tissue disease, treatment options including NSAIDs, low-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate can be helpful. Sometimes TNF blockers ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), or ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') are considered for inflammatory arthritis. Physical therapy for certain joints is sometimes helpful. For ''pulmonary hypertension'', medications that tend to open the arteries to the lungs are used along with blood-thinning drugs and even supplemental oxygen. For ''interstitial lung disease'', prednisone and cyclophosphamide are considered. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as ''captopril'' (''Capoten'') and ''enalapril'' (''Vasotec''), are used to prevent damage to the kidneys, especially if ''blood pressure'' is elevated. ''Esophagus'' irritation and ''heartburn'' can be prevented by elevating the head of the bed and can be relieved with ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec'') or ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''). Antacids can also be helpful. ''Constipation'', cramping, and ''diarrhea'' are sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with ''tetracycline'' or ''erythromycin''.''For '""Raynaud's""' phenomenon, patients are recommended to use hand- and body-warming techniques while protecting the fingers from injury. ''Nifedipine'' (''Procardia''), ''losartan'' (''Cozaar'', ''Hyzaar''), and ''nitroglycerin'' cream are used to dilate the constricted blood vessels. Severe RP can lead to ''gangrene'' and the loss of digits. In rare cases of severe disease, nerve surgery called ""sympathectomy"" is sometimes considered. In order to prevent blood vessel constriction, the nerves that stimulate the constriction of the vessels (sympathetic nerves) are surgically interrupted. Usually, this is performed during an operation that is localized to the sides of the base of the fingers at the hand. Through small incisions the tiny nerves around the blood vessels are stripped away. This procedure is referred to as a digital sympathectomy.'  "
What are home remedies for mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Gastroesophageal reflux disease'"" in mixed connective tissue disease can be helped by elevation of the head of the bed and taking stomach acid-blocking medications. Raynaud's phenomenon can be helped by general body warming and wearing gloves to prevent chilling."" "
What is the prognosis of mixed connective tissue disease?,'The outlook for mixed connective tissue disease very much depends on the location and intensity of the organs affected. Those who are treated and monitored early tend to have better outcomes.' 
Is it possible to prevent mixed connective tissue disease?,'No. There is no ''prevention'' for mixed connective tissue disease.' 
Are there support groups for mixed connective tissue disease?,'See the local chapter of the Arthritis Foundation for information about support groups.' 
What Is the Goal of Physical Therapy?,"'The goal of physical therapy is to get a person back to the point where he or she can perform normal, everyday activities without difficulty. ''Preserving good range of motion is key to maintain the ability to perform daily activities. Therefore, increasing the range of motion of a joint is the primary focus of physical therapy. Building strength in the involved muscles surrounding the joint also is extremely important, since stronger muscles can better stabilize a weakened joint. ''Physical therapists provide exercises designed to preserve the strength and use of your joints. They can show you the best way to move from one position to another and can also teach you how to use ''walking'' aids such as crutches, a walker or a cane, if necessary. ' "
What Are Some Benefits of Occupational and Physical Therapy?,"'If you have arthritis, there are many benefits to participating in a physical and occupational therapy program, including: ' You gain education about your type of arthritis, so that you can be well 
	informed. If you are overweight, a dietary plan can be created to reduce the 
	stress of excess weight on supporting joints of the back, legs, and feet. As 
	yet, no specific diet -- other than a diet designed for weight loss -- has 
	proved helpful for arthritis. You gain foot-care advice, including choice of well-fitting shoes with 
	shock-absorbing outer soles and sculptured (orthotic) insoles molded exactly 
	to the contour of each foot. You will learn therapeutic methods to relieve discomfort and improve 
	performance through various physical techniques and activity modifications."
What Techniques Will I Learn?,"""You'll learn several techniques, including:"" Rest. Bed rest helps reduce both joint inflammation and pain, and is especially useful when multiple joints are affected and fatigue is a major problem. Individual joint rest is most helpful when arthritis involves one or only a few joints. Custom splints can be made to rest and support inflamed joints and a soft collar can support the neck while you are sitting or standing. Thermal modalities. Applying ice packs or heating pads, as well as deep heat provided by ultrasound and hot packs, can help relieve local pain. Heat also relaxes muscle spasm around inflamed joints. Heating joints and muscles with a warm bath or shower before exercising may help you exercise more easily. Exercise. Exercise is an important part of arthritis treatment that is most effective when done properly every day. Your doctor and therapist will prescribe a program for you that may vary as your needs change."
What Therapy Is Offered for People Recovering From Joint Replacement?,"'Preoperative programs of education and exercise, started before joint replacement surgery, are continued at home. They may be changed in the hospital after surgery to fit new needs during the rehabilitation period. These exercises may be added to your usual exercise regimen, and you may find your ability to exercise has improved after surgery.' "
What Joint Protection Techniques Are Offered?,"'There are ways to reduce the ''stress'' on joints affected by arthritis while participating in daily activities. Some of these include: ''An occupational therapist can show you ways to do everyday tasks without worsening pain or causing joint damage. Some joint protection techniques include: ' Controlling your weight to avoid putting extra stress on weight-bearing 
	joints such as the back, hips, knees, and feet. Being aware of body position, using good posture to protect your back 
	and the joints of your legs and feet. When possible, sit down to do a job 
	instead of standing. Change position often since staying in one position for 
	a long time tends to increase stiffness and pain. Conserving energy by allowing for rest periods, both during the workday 
	and during an activity. Respecting pain. It is your body's way of telling you something is 
	wrong. Don't try an activity that puts strain on joints that are already 
	painful or stiff. Using proper body mechanics for getting in and out of a car, chair or 
	tub, as well as for lifting objects. Using your strongest joints and muscles to reduce the stress on smaller 
	joints. For example, carrying a purse or briefcase with a shoulder strap 
	rather than with your hand. Distributing pressure to minimize stress on any one joint. Lifting 
	dishes with both palms rather than with your fingers and carrying heavy 
	loads in your arms instead of with your hands. If your hands are affected by arthritis, avoid tight gripping, pinching, 
	squeezing, and twisting. Ways to accomplish the same tasks with alternate 
	methods or tools can usually be found."
What Are Assistive Devices for Arthritis?,"'If you have arthritis, many assistive devices have been developed to make activities easier and less stressful for the joints and muscles. Your therapist can suggest devices that will be helpful for tasks you may find difficult at home or at work.''A few examples of helpful devices include a bath ''stool'' for use in the shower or tub, grab bars around the toilet or tub, and long-handled shoehorns or sock grippers. Your therapist can show you catalogs that have a wide variety of assistive devices.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about plant thorn arthritis," Plant thorn arthritis is a noninfectious inflammation of a joint as a result of a thorn puncturing the joint and leaving residual plant matter lodged within the joint. Plant thorn arthritis typically affects only a single joint -- the joint that was pierced by the plant thorn. Plant thorn arthritis causes the involved joint to be swollen, slightly reddish, stiff, and painful. The joint loses its full range of motion and is often tender. The symptoms of plant thorn arthritis may occur long after the thorn is removed from the affected joint. The diagnosis of plant thorn arthritis requires either detection of a piece of thorn within the joint by radiology testing or surgical removal of the thorn fragments and identification of the fragments microscopically in the laboratory. Synovectomy is the surgical procedure that is used to cure plant thorn arthritis."
What is plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis is a noninfectious inflammation of a joint as a result of a thorn puncturing the joint and leaving residual plant matter lodged within the joint. The plant thorn fragments cause a localized inflammation reaction in the joint lining tissue that leads to swelling, ''stiffness'', loss of range of motion, and ''pain''. The joint lining tissue is called the synovium. Inflammation of this tissue is medically referred to as synovitis. Plant thorn arthritis is also called plant thorn synovitis.' "
What plants cause plant thorn arthritis?,"'The plants that commonly cause plant thorn arthritis are those that produce thorns. These plants include palm trees, roses, black-thorn shrubs, cacti, bougainvillea, yucca, pyracantha, plum trees, and mesquite trees. Exposure to these plants is the greatest risk factor for plant thorn arthritis.'  "
What are risk factors for plant thorn arthritis?,"'Risk factors for plant thorn arthritis include gardening, especially without gloves, and exposure to thorn-bearing plants, including palm trees, roses, black-thorn shrubs, cacti, bougainvillea, yucca, pyracantha, plum trees, and mesquite trees.' "
What joints are typically involved in plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis typically affects only a single joint -- the joint that was pierced by the plant thorn. The most common joints affected by plant thorn arthritis are those that can be exposed to being stabbed by falling into or brushing up against plants with thorns. Joints that are commonly affected by plant thorn synovitis include the small joints of the hands (metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints), ''feet'', elbows, knees, and ankles.'

What are plant thorn arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Plant thorn arthritis causes the involved joint to be''The joint loses its full range of motion and is often tender. These symptoms may be noticed only many days after the initial thorn puncture. It is not uncommon for the person affected by plant thorn arthritis to remove the thorn immediately after the puncture and then develop the arthritis many days or weeks later and not even recall that the joint had been punctured previously! This is because the original thorn has actually left behind small fragments of thorn vegetable matter that gradually cause the inflammation of plant thorn arthritis. This form of single joint arthritis (monoarthritis) then becomes chronic until appropriately treated.'   swollen, slightly reddish, stiff, and painful."
What specialties of doctors treat plant thorn arthritis?,'Plant thorn arthritis requires operative intervention. Doctors who perform operative treatments include orthopedic surgeons and ''plastic'' surgeons.' 
How is plant thorn arthritis diagnosed?,"'Plant thorn arthritis is suspected in a patient who presents with a single joint that is inflamed after it has been punctured by a plant thorn. This is true even if the patient recalls removing the thorn, as described above, because the thorn can leave behind tiny fragments of thorn matter that leads to the chronic inflammation of plant thorn arthritis.''Removal of joint fluid (''joint aspiration'') is performed to rule out bacterial or fungal infection of the joint.''Ultimately, the diagnosis of plant thorn arthritis requires either detection of a piece of thorn within the joint by radiology testing or surgical removal of the thorn fragments and identification of the fragments microscopically in the laboratory. Sometimes tiny pieces of thorns can be visualized using ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'' scanning), high-resolution ''computerized tomography'' (HR-CAT scanning), or ''ultrasound'' imaging. Often, however, the residual thorn fragments are too small to be seen with these methods and are detected only when identified in tissue that is surgically removed from the joint.''The affected joint lining tissue (synovium) is examined in the pathology department using microscopes. The tissue forms a characteristic reaction, called a granulomatous reaction, within the synovium (granulomatous synovitis). The microscopic thorn fragments are easily identified using a polarized light microscope as they appear brilliantly shiny (birefringent) to the examining pathologist.' "
What is the treatment for plant thorn arthritis?,"'It is important to recognize that puncturing a joint with a foreign material, such as a plant thorn, can lead to bacterial infection (''septic arthritis'') or fungal infection (''fungal arthritis'') of the joint. This possibility can be excluded by removing joint fluid and culturing the fluid in the laboratory. While plant thorn arthritis is technically noninfectious, these two forms of ''infectious arthritis'' can occur from plant thorn puncture of a joint, with or without true plant thorn arthritis. These forms of arthritis require urgent antibiotic treatment.''For plant thorn arthritis, anti-inflammatory medications may quiet some of the inflammation. However, chronic arthritis eventually develops even long after the plant thorn injury because of the thorn fragments remaining in the joint. This arthritis persists until the fragments are removed with a surgical operation. Without surgical resection of the plant fragments, ''joint inflammation'' persists and permanent joint destruction can occur. There is no specific medication or home remedy for plant thorn arthritis.''The surgical operation that can cure plant thorn arthritis is called a synovectomy with joint lavage (joint washout cleaning). During a synovectomy, the surgeon will remove the affected and surrounding joint lining tissue (synovium) to be certain that microscopic joint fragments within the joint and its lining are eliminated from the body.'  "
What is the prognosis of plant thorn arthritis?,"'Once a synovectomy for plant thorn arthritis has been performed, the joint tends to heal well without residual problems. The sooner the synovectomy is performed, the better the outcome as chronic ''joint inflammation'' can risk damage to cartilage of the joint. Physical therapy rehabilitation exercises can be helpful to restore normal joint function.' "
Is it possible to prevent plant thorn arthritis?,"'Plant thorn arthritis can be prevented by avoiding exposure to the thorns of plants. It can help to wear protective clothing, gloves, etc., as well as being cautious when near or working with thorny plants.' "
Facts you should know about pseudogout, Pseudogout is caused by crystals in a joint. Pseudogout causes arthritis (joint inflammation). Pseudogout can cause calcification of cartilage. The arthritis of pseudogout is diagnosed by detecting typical crystals in joint fluid. Treatment of pseudogout is directed at the inflammation. Pseudogout can be associated with other illnesses.
What is pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is a type of inflammation of joints (arthritis) that is caused by deposits of crystals, called calcium pyrophosphate, in and around the joints. Pseudogout literally means ""false ''gout''."" It derives its name from its similarity to ''gout''.''Pseudogout has many similarities to true ''gout'', which also can cause arthritis. However, the crystal that incites the inflammation of ''gout'' is monosodium urate. The crystals that cause pseudogout and ''gout'' each have distinct appearances when joint fluid containing them is viewed under a microscope. This makes it possible to precisely identify the cause of the joint inflammation when joint fluid is available.''Pseudogout has been reported to occasionally coexist with gout. This means that the two types of crystals can sometimes be found in the same joint fluid. Researchers have also noted that the cartilage of patients who had both forms of crystals in their joint fluid was often visibly calcified, as seen on X-ray images.' "
What are causes of pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is primarily caused by the precipitation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals developing within a joint space. Pseudogout has sometimes been referred to as calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease or CPPD.''Pseudogout is clearly related to ''aging'' as it is more common in the elderly and is associated with ''degenerative arthritis''. Acute attacks of the arthritis of pseudogout can be caused by ''dehydration''. This is particularly common in hospitalized patients and those recovering from operations, especially when associated with ''dehydration''. Pseudogout can also be caused by the hormonal effects on calcium metabolism from ''hyperparathyroidism''.'  "
What are risk factors for pseudogout?,"'Older age and a history of joint ''trauma'' (either due to an accident or surgery) are risk factors for pseudogout.''Additional risk factors for pseudogout include hyperparathyroidism, ''amyloidosis'', gout, and degenerative arthritis (''osteoarthritis'').' "
What are pseudogout symptoms and signs?,"'Pseudogout can result in arthritis of a number of joints. The most common joint affected is the knee, but it can also involve the wrists, shoulders, hips, and/or ankles. Pseudogout usually affects only one or a few joints at a time. The ""attacks"" of joint inflammation, characterized by acute ''joint swelling'', warmth, ''stiffness'', and ''pain'', may last for days to weeks and can resolve spontaneously. The inflammation leads to loss of range of motion and function of the involved joint.'  "
How does a doctor diagnose pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is suggested when abnormal calcifications are seen in the cartilage of joints on ''X-rays''. These calcifications are referred to as chondrocalcinosis and very suggestive of a diagnosis of pseudogout when there is also inflammation of the involved joint.''The diagnosis of pseudogout is ultimately made when fluid from a joint is extracted and is examined under a special microscope called a polarizing microscope. With this microscope, the calcium pyrophosphate crystals are clearly identified by their characteristic shape and color (medically term weakly positively birefringent rhomboid crystals).''The arthritis of pseudogout is common in older adults, particularly in the context of dehydration such as occurs with hospitalization or surgery.' "
What are treatments for pseudogout?,"'The treatment of pseudogout is directed toward stopping the inflammation in the joints. Local ice applications and resting can help. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') and others are often first drugs of choice.''Removing fluid containing the crystals from the joint can reduce ''pain'' and help the inflammation to diminish more quickly. Cortisone injected into an inflamed joint will also help decrease the inflammation. ''Colchicine'' (''Colcrys'') is a medication used to decrease inflammation in patients with gout and may also be helpful in pseudogout. ''Corticosteroids'"" taken as a pill can help if the patient can't tolerate colchicine or NSAIDs.""'Long-term ''prevention'' of recurrent pseudogout is often best achieved with small daily doses of colchicine and optimal hydration.'  "
What other conditions can accompany pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout can occur along with ''aging'', be ''inherited'', or be associated with ''hemophilia'', ''hemochromatosis'', ochronosis, amyloidosis, or hormonal disorders (such as hyperparathyroidism and ''hypothyroidism''). These illnesses, as well as others, are considered in the initial evaluation of a patient with pseudogout.' "
"Are there special circumstances that can promote attacks of
 pseudogout?",'Arthritis attacks of pseudogout can be precipitated by dehydration and not infrequently follow surgical procedures in elderly patients.' 
What are complications of pseudogout?,'Pseudogout can be complicated by difficulty in ''walking'' and injury to the cartilage and bone of affected joints.' 
What is the prognosis of pseudogout?,"'The outlook of pseudogout is generally very good. Aggressive treatment of the inflammation can lead to complete resolution of the inflammation, pain, tenderness, and loss of joint function. While this can last for weeks, the inflammation of resolves within days with proper treatment.''Recurrent attacks of pseudogout and chronic joint inflammation can lead to injury to the affected cartilage and bone.' "
Is it possible to prevent pseudogout?,'Patients with known pseudogout should stay well hydrated before and after operations to minimize the risk of attacks of pseudogout. Resting the joints may help during a flare-up.'  
What specialists treat pseudogout?,"'Pseudogout is treated by general practitioners, family practitioners, internists, ''rheumatologists'', and orthopedists.' "
Where can people get more information about pseudogout?,'People can get more information about pseudogout from the Arthritis Foundation.' 
Facts you should know about psoriatic arthritis," Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (inflammatory arthritis). Some 15%-25% of people with psoriasis also develop inflammation of joints (psoriatic arthritis). The first appearance of the skin disease (psoriasis) can be separated from the onset of joint disease (arthritis) by years. Psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs includelow back pain,conjunctivitis,reduced range of motion,swollen joints,nail pitting,joint pain and morning stiffness,foot pain,fatigue,swelling of the toes and fingers (dactylitis). low back pain, conjunctivitis, reduced range of motion, swollen joints, nail pitting, joint pain and morning stiffness, foot pain, fatigue, swelling of the toes and fingers (dactylitis). Psoriatic arthritis belongs to a group of arthritis conditions that can cause inflammation of the spine (spondyloarthropathies). People with psoriatic arthritis can develop inflammation of tendons, cartilage, eyes, lung lining, and, rarely, the aorta. The arthritis of psoriatic arthritis is treated independently of the psoriasis, with exercise, ice applications, medications, and surgery."
What is psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a form of inflammation of the skin (psoriasis) and joints (inflammatory arthritis). Psoriasis is a common skin condition affecting 2% of the Caucasian population in the United States. Signs and symptoms include patchy, raised, red areas of ''skin inflammation'' with scaling. Psoriasis often affects the tips of the elbows and knees, the ''scalp'' and ears, the navel, and around the genital areas or anus. Approximately 15%-25% of patients who have psoriasis also develop an associated inflammation of their joints. Patients who have inflammatory arthritis and psoriasis are diagnosed as having psoriatic arthritis.''The onset of psoriatic arthritis generally occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Males and females are affected equally. The skin disease (psoriasis) and the joint disease (arthritis) often appear separately. In fact, the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of people. However, the arthritis may precede the psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. In some patients, the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis can be difficult if the arthritis precedes psoriasis by many years. In fact, some patients have had arthritis for over 20 years before psoriasis eventually appears! Conversely, patients can have psoriasis for over 20 years prior to the development of arthritis, leading to the ultimate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.''Psoriatic arthritis is a systemic rheumatic disease that also can cause inflammation in body tissues away from the joints other than the skin, such as in the eyes, ''heart'', ''lungs'', and kidneys. Psoriatic arthritis shares many symptoms with several other arthritic conditions, such as ''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'"", and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. All of these health conditions can cause inflammation in the spine and other joints, and the eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to cause inflammation of the spine, these health conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.""'  "
What causes psoriatic arthritis?,"'The cause of psoriatic arthritis is currently unknown. A combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors is likely involved. In patients with psoriatic arthritis who have arthritis of the spine, a blood test gene marker called HLA-B27 is found in about 50%. Several other genes have also been found to be more common in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Certain changes in the immune system may also be important in the development of psoriatic arthritis. For example, the decline in the number of immune cells called helper T cells in people with ''AIDS'' (''HIV'' infection) may play a role in the development and progression of psoriasis in these patients. The importance of infectious agents and other environmental factors in the cause of psoriatic arthritis is being investigated by researchers.' "
What are risk factors for developing psoriatic arthritis?,"'The major risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis is having a family member with psoriasis. This relationship has been recognized as so significant that it is used as a helpful part of the health history for the doctor to aid in the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. It might be that stressful life situations could affect the immune system, allowing for the expression and/or exacerbation of psoriatic arthritis. However, precisely how these emotional issues are related to psoriatic arthritis has not been established.' "
What are the different types of psoriatic arthritis?,"'The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical polyarthritis (both sides of the body), asymmetric oligoarticular, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and ''arthritis mutilans''.' "
What are psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'In most patients, the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. There can be tiny pitting nail changes of the finger and toenails. The type of psoriatic arthritis depends on the distribution of the joints affected. Accordingly, there are five types of psoriatic arthritis: symmetrical, asymmetric and few joints, spondylitis, distal interphalangeal joints, and arthritis mutilans.''The arthritis frequently involves the knees, ankles, and joints in the ''feet''. Usually, only a few joints are inflamed at a time. The inflamed joints become painful, stiff, swollen, hot, tender, and red during flare-ups. There is usually loss of range of motion of the involved joints. Sometimes, psoriatic ''joint inflammation'' in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit (dactylitis), giving them a sausage-like appearance. ''Joint stiffness'' is a common arthritis symptom and is typically worse early in the morning. Less commonly, psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion, mimicking the pattern seen in ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the ''sacrum'' (sacroiliitis), causing other symptoms like ''pain'' and stiffness in the low back, buttocks, neck, and upper back. Occasionally, psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. A very destructive, though less common, form of arthritis called ""mutilans"" can cause rapid joint damage. Fortunately, this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis.''Patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis), tendon insertion points on bone (''enthesitis'', inflammation of the entheses), and around cartilage. Inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes Achilles tendinitis, leading to ''pain'' with ''walking'' and climbing stairs. Inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause ''chest pain'', as seen in ''costochondritis''.''Aside from arthritis and spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis can cause symptoms like ''fatigue'' and inflammation in other organs, such as the eyes, lungs, and aorta. Inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (''iris'') causes ''iritis'', a painful health condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. ''Corticosteroids'' injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent ''blindness''. Inflammation in and around the lungs (''pleuritis'') causes ''chest pain'', especially with deep ''breathing'' as the lungs expand against the inflamed areas, as well as ''shortness of breath''. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valves, leading to ''heart failure'' and shortness of breath.''Acne'' and nail changes are symptoms commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. Pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. ''Onycholysis'', or separation of the nail bed, may also occur. Interestingly, these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. ''Acne'' has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. In fact, a syndrome exists that features inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis), ''acne'', pustules on the feet or palms, thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis), and bone inflammation (osteitis). This syndrome is, therefore, named by the eponym ''SAPHO syndrome''.'  "
What types of doctors treat psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is generally treated by ''rheumatologists'', health specialists in diagnosing and treating arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Other doctors who may be involved in the care of patients with psoriatic arthritis include dermatologists and primary care doctors, including family and general practitioners and internal medicine specialists. When surgical treatment is needed for severe joint disease, orthopedic surgeons can be consulted. Other health care givers can include occupational and physical therapists.' "
How does a health care professional diagnose psoriatic arthritis?,"'Psoriatic arthritis is a diagnosis made mainly on clinical grounds, based on the finding of psoriasis and the typical inflammatory arthritis of the spine and/or other joints. There is no laboratory test to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Blood tests such as ''C-reactive protein'' and ''sedimentation rate'' may show an abnormal elevated result and merely reflect presence of inflammation in the joints and other organs of the body. Other blood tests, such as ''rheumatoid factor'', are obtained to exclude ''rheumatoid arthritis''. When one or two large joints (such a knees) are inflamed, ''arthrocentesis'' can be performed. Arthrocentesis is an office procedure whereby a sterile needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) fluid from the inflamed joints. The fluid is then analyzed for inflammation, infection, ''gout'' crystals, and other inflammatory conditions. ''X-rays'' may show changes of cartilage or bone injury indicative of arthritis of the spine, sacroiliac joints, and/or joints of the hands. Typical X-ray findings include bony erosions resulting from arthritis, but these may not be present in early disease. ''MRI'' scanning is sometimes used to identify early erosion of joints. The blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27, mentioned above, is often performed. This marker can be found in over 50% of patients with psoriatic arthritis who have spine inflammation.'  "
What are medications and treatment options for psoriatic arthritis?,"'The medical treatment of the arthritis aspects of psoriatic arthritis is described below. The treatment of psoriasis and the other involved organs is beyond the scope of this article.''Generally, the treatment of arthritis in psoriatic arthritis involves a combination of anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') and ''exercise''. If progressive inflammation and joint destruction occur despite NSAIDs treatment, more potent medications such as ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), corticosteroids, and antimalarial medications (such as ''hydroxychloroquine'' [Plaquenil]) are used.''Exercise programs can be done at home or with a physical therapist and are customized according to the disease and physical capabilities of each patient. Warm-up stretching, or other techniques, such as a hot shower or heat applications are helpful to relax muscles prior to exercise. Ice application after the routine can help minimize post-exercise soreness and inflammation. In general, exercises for arthritis are performed for the purpose of strengthening and maintaining or improving joint range of motion. They should be done on a regular basis for best results.''Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (NSAIDs) are a group of ''over-the-counter'' medications that are helpful in reducing joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' sodium (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''). Their most frequent side effects include signs and symptoms like stomach upset and ulceration. The drugs can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Newer NSAIDs called ''COX-2 inhibitors'' (such as ''celecoxib'' [''Celebrex'']) cause gastrointestinal problems less frequently.'  "
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for psoriatic arthritis,"'Patients who experience progressive joint destruction in spite of NSAIDs are candidates for more aggressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Disease-modifying medications are important to prevent progressive joint destruction and deformity. These drugs include methotrexate, which is used orally or can be given by injection on a weekly basis for psoriatic arthritis as well as for psoriasis alone. It can cause bone-marrow suppression, as well as ''liver'' damage with long-term use. Regular monitoring of blood counts and ''liver blood tests'' should be performed during therapy with methotrexate.''Antimalarial medication, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), is also used for persistent psoriatic arthritis. Its potential side effects include injury to the retina of the eye. Regular ophthalmologist examinations are suggested while using this medication.''Sulfasalazine'"" (Azulfidine) is an oral sulfa-related medicine that has also been helpful in some patients with persistent psoriatic arthritis. Traditionally, Azulfidine has been an important agent in the medical treatment of ulcerative and Crohn's ""'colitis''. It should be taken with food, as it, too, can cause gastrointestinal upset.''Medical research has demonstrated effective treatment of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with ''leflunomide'' (''Arava''), a medication that is also used for the treatment of ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Medications that block the chemical messenger known as ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF) are another treatment option for moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis. The TNF-blockers ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''golimumab'' (''Simponi''), and ''certolizumab'' pegol (''Cimzia'') are also referred to as biologic medications and can be very effective for severe psoriatic arthritis. They can significantly improve or eradicate both the psoriasis and the arthritis as well as stop progressive joint damage. These medications are given intravenously or by injections. There is an increased risk of infection while taking biologic medications and patients are screened for underlying ''tuberculosis'' prior to TNF-blocker administration.''Ustekinumab'' (''Stelara'') is an injectable biologic medication that is used to treat severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with or without methotrexate. This biologic works by blocking chemical messengers called interleukins. There is an increased risk of infections while taking ustekinumab.''Apremilast'' (''Otezla'') is an oral medicine approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate and for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast works by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Apremilast can have side effects, including an increase in ''depression'' and gastrointestinal upset such as ''diarrhea'' and ''nausea''.'""Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is an injectable biologic medication used to treat adults with psoriatic arthritis. Secukinumab is an antibody that binds to and blocks interleukin 17, an important chemical messenger in the inflammation of the skin in psoriasis and the joints in psoriatic arthritis. After a month of weekly loading injections, it is given monthly, or by monthly injections from the start according to the doctor's discretion.""'Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth (such as ''prednisone'') or injected (cortisone) directly into the joints to reduce inflammation. Steroids can have side effects, especially with long-term use. These include thinning of the skin, ''easy bruising'', infections, ''diabetes'', ''osteoporosis'' and, rarely, bone death (necrosis) of the hips and knees.''While the relationship between the skin disease and joint disease is not clear, there are reports of improvement of the arthritis simultaneously with clearing of the psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis can benefit by direct sunlight exposure and are often treated with direct ultraviolet light therapy.''Finally, patients who have severe destruction of the joints may be candidates for orthopedic surgical repair. Total hip joint replacement and total ''knee joint'' replacement surgery are now commonplace in community hospitals throughout the United States.' "
What are psoriatic arthritis complications?,"'Psoriatic arthritis can be complicated by issues within the skin or the joints. The skin of psoriasis can become infected and require antibiotic treatments. The joints can become destroyed, deformed, and functionless. With aggressive medical treatment, however, these complications are generally avoidable. Psoriatic arthritis with eye, bowel, lung, or heart-valve inflammation can be complicated by disease in these areas. The degree of any injury depends on the location, the intensity, and duration of the inflammation.' "
What is the prognosis of psoriatic arthritis?,"'With aggressive treatment and monitoring of both the skin and the joints, patients can have an excellent outcome. It is particularly important to begin treatments early in the course of the arthritis for best results. Newer biologic medications can be extremely effective for those whose disease fails to respond to methotrexate or who cannot take it.' "
Is it possible to prevent psoriatic arthritis?,"'There is no method for the ''prevention'' of psoriatic arthritis. It is best to treat the skin optimally. Treatments that control the disease, in a sense, prevent recurrence of the arthritis. Because when they are discontinued, the inflammatory joint disease typically recurs.' "
Is there a psoriatic arthritis diet? Are there home remedies for psoriatic arthritis?,"'It has been shown that ''vitamin D'' might improve the arthritis of psoriatic arthritis. Research has shown this to be a helpful dietary modification. There is no other universally effective ''diet'', or foods to avoid, for psoriatic arthritis. There are also no dependable home remedies for psoriatic arthritis. However, ''vitamin D'' supplementation may be beneficial for both the skin and joints. In Europe, people have bathed in the Dead Sea for psoriasis treatment.' "
What does the future hold for patients with psoriatic arthritis?,"'The future treatment of psoriatic arthritis will evolve as more effective and safe medicines are developed. Areas of clinical research involve treatment with medications that can alter the immune systems of patients with psoriatic arthritis. As the immune system changes and genetics are better defined for psoriatic disease, the efficacy of medical treatments will improve.''For more information about psoriatic arthritis, please visit the following site: National Psoriasis Foundation (''http://www.psoriasis.org/'').'

Facts you should know about reactive arthritis,"   Reactive arthritis involves inflammation of joints due to an infection in another part of your body. The most common triggers are the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Reactive arthritis can occur after genital (venereal) infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or enteric infection (dysentery) with Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, or Clostridium difficile. Reactive arthritis shares many features with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and the arthritis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Reactive arthritis can affect the joints, the spine, the eyes, urinary tract, mouth, colon, and heart. There is no single laboratory test for diagnosing reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 genetic marker is commonly found in the blood. Treatment of reactive arthritis is directed toward the specific body area(s) inflamed or affected."
What is reactive arthritis?,"'Reactive arthritis is a chronic form of inflammatory\xa0arthritis featuring the following three conditions: (1) inflamed joints, (2) inflammation of the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), and (3) inflammation of the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems.''This form of ''joint inflammation'' is called ""reactive arthritis"" because it is felt to involve an immune system that is ""reacting"" to the presence of ''bacterial infections'"" in the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Accordingly, certain people's immune systems are genetically primed to react aberrantly when these areas are exposed to certain bacteria. The aberrant reaction of the immune system leads to spontaneous inflammation in the joints and eyes. This can be confounding to the patient and the doctor when the infection has long passed at the time of presentation with arthritis or eye inflammation.""""Reactive arthritis has, in the past, been referred to as Reiter syndrome (a term that has lost favor because of Dr. Hans Reiter's dubious past, one of enthusiastically embracing Nazi politics and medical abominations). In addition, Reiter syndrome would refer to a specific type of reactive arthritis limiting inflammation to the eyes, urethra, and joints.""'Reactive arthritis most frequently occurs in patients in their 30s or 40s, but it can occur at any age. The form of reactive arthritis that occurs after genital infection (venereal) occurs more frequently in males. The form that develops after bowel infection (dysentery) occurs in equal frequency in males and females.''Reactive arthritis is considered a systemic rheumatic disease. This means it can affect other organs than the joints, causing inflammation in tissues such as the eyes, mouth, skin, kidneys, heart, and ''lungs''. Reactive arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions, such as ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'"", and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause similar disease and inflammation in the spine and other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to inflame the spine, these conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.""'  "
What causes reactive arthritis?,"'As mentioned, reactive arthritis is felt in part to be genetic. There are certain genetic markers that are far more frequent in patients with reactive arthritis than in the normal population. For example, the HLA-B27 gene is commonly seen in patients with reactive arthritis. Even in patients who have the genetic background that predisposes them to developing reactive arthritis, however, exposure to certain infections seems to be required to trigger the onset of the disease.''Reactive arthritis can occur after venereal infections. The most common bacterium that has been associated with this post-venereal form of reactive arthritis is an organism called ''Chlamydia'' trachomatis''. Reactive arthritis also occurs after infectious dysentery, with bacterial organisms in the bowel, such as ''Salmonella'', '' ''Shigella'', ''Yersinia'', ''Campylobacter'', and ''Clostridium difficile''. Typically, the arthritis develops one to three weeks after the onset of the bacterial infection. Reactive arthritis has also been reported associated with bladder infusions of BCG used for treating ''bladder cancer''.' "
What are reactive arthritis risk factors?," Gender: Reactive arthritis is more frequent in men. Age: It is most frequent in people 20-40 years of age. Hereditary factors: There are inherited genes, such as HLA-B27, that increase the risk for developing reactive arthritis."
What are reactive arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of reactive arthritis can be divided into those that affect the joints and those that affect the non-joint areas.''The classic joints that can become inflamed in reactive arthritis are the knees, ankles, and ''feet''. The particular joints involved are usually asymmetric, that is, one side of the body or the other is affected with signs and symptoms, rather than both sides simultaneously. The inflammation leads to ''joint pain'', ''stiffness'', swelling, warmth, and redness. Patients may develop inflammation of entire fingers or toes which can give the appearance of a ""sausage digit."" This feature is also seen in patients with another type of arthritis called ''psoriatic arthritis'' that is associated with ''skin inflammation'' of ''psoriasis''. The arthritis of reactive arthritis can be associated with inflammation of the spine, leading to stiffness and joint\xa0''pain'' in the back or neck (characteristic of all of the spondyloarthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis).''Cartilage can also become inflamed, especially around the breastbone where the ribs meet in the front of the chest; this condition is called ''costochondritis''. Muscles attach to the bones by tendons. In reactive arthritis, the tendon insertion points can become inflamed (''enthesitis''), tender, and painful when exercised. Achilles tendinitis is common with reactive arthritis.''Non-joint areas that become inflamed and cause symptoms of ''pain'' and irritation in patients with reactive arthritis include the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), genitals, urinary tract (urethra, bladder and ''prostate gland''), skin, mouth lining, large bowel, and the ''aorta''.''Inflammation of the white portion of the eye (''conjunctivitis'') and the ''iris'' of the eye (''iritis'') is frequently seen early in reactive arthritis and may be intermittent. When the whites of the eye are inflamed causing conjunctivitis, there may be no pain. When the colored part of the eye (iris) is inflamed, causing iritis and ''uveitis'', it can be very painful and especially worse when looking into bright lights (medically referred to as ''photophobia'').''Urinary tract inflammation commonly involves the urethra, the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This inflammation (''urethritis'') can be associated with burning on urination and/or ''pus drainage'' from the end of the penis. The skin around the penis can become inflamed and peel. The bladder and prostate gland can also become inflamed, leading to an urge to urinate from ''cystitis'' and ''prostatitis'' respectively.''The skin of the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet can develop tiny fluid-filled ''blisters'' that sometimes are filled with old blood. The affected skin can peel and may mimic ''psoriasis''. The classic appearance is medically referred to as keratoderma blennorrhagica. Similar inflammation of the tip of the penis can cause irritating ''rash'' in males, referred to as circinate ''balanitis''.''The mouth can develop open sores (ulcerations) on the hard and soft palate and even on the tongue. These may go unnoticed by the patient, as they are often painless. Inflammation of the large bowel (''colitis'') can cause ''diarrhea'' or pus or ''blood in the stool''. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can be seen in a small percentage of patients who have reactive arthritis. It can lead to failure of the ''aortic valve'' of the heart, which can cause ''heart failure''. The electrical conducting pathway of the heart can also become scarred in reactive arthritis, leading to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) that may require placement of a ''pacemaker'' to regulate the heartbeat.'

What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of reactive arthritis?,"'There is no single lab test used to diagnose reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is diagnosed based upon recognition of the combination of arthritis with symptoms such as inflammation of the eyes, and the genital, urinary, and/or gastrointestinal systems. The health care professional obtains a medical history to note the time course of possible infection in the genital or urinary tracts, or the bowel. Stiffness and pain are monitored. Inflammatory types of joint problems typically cause more stiffness in the morning. Blood tests such as a ''sedimentation rate'' may be obtained to document the presence of inflammation in the body. The ''rheumatoid factor'', which is typically present in ''rheumatoid arthritis'', is usually negative in reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 gene marker blood test can be helpful, especially in the diagnosis of patients with spine disease. Other tests may be ordered to eliminate other possible diseases with similar symptoms.''X-rays'' of the spine or other joints can reveal typical changes of inflammation in these areas but generally not until later in the disease. Occasionally, there are areas of unusual calcifications at the points where the tendons attach to the bones, indicating past inflammation in these areas. Those patients with eye inflammation may require ophthalmology evaluation to document the degree of inflammation in the iris. ''Stool'' cultures might be obtained to detect the presence of infections in the bowel. Similarly, ''urinalysis'' and culture of the urine may be necessary to detect bacterial infection in the urinary tract. The prostate gland, which can also be inflamed in a patient with reactive arthritis, may be examined for tenderness.''Sometimes the fluid of the inflamed joint needs to be examined. In this case, a health care professional will use a needle to withdraw fluid from the joint in sterile fashion. The joint fluid will be examined for white blood cells, bacteria (to check for infection), and crystals (to eliminate ''gout'' as a diagnosis).' "
What are reactive arthritis treatment options?,"'Treatment of reactive arthritis is based on where it has become manifest in the body. For joint inflammation, patients are generally initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''). These NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''piroxicam'' (''Feldene''), and others. Among their potential side effects are gastrointestinal irritation, including ulceration and bleeding. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be taken with food to minimize this risk. ''Corticosteroids'', such as ''prednisone'', can be helpful to reduce inflammation and are used in the short-term treatment of inflammation in reactive arthritis. They can be given by mouth or by local injection into the joint. Corticosteroids are also used to decrease tendon inflammation in some forms of tendinitis.''Antibiotics may be prescribed if one still has the infection that triggered reactive arthritis.''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) has been shown to be effective in some patients with persistent reactive arthritis. Potential side effects of this sulfa-based medication include sulfa ''rash'' reaction and suppression of the bone marrow. Therefore, blood counts are monitored when Azulfidine is used long-term.''For the aggressive inflammation of chronic joint inflammation in reactive arthritis, medications that suppress the immune system, including the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), are used. Methotrexate can be given orally by injection. It is given on a weekly basis and requires regular monitoring of blood counts and blood ''liver tests'' because of potential toxicity to the bone marrow and ''liver''.''Tumor'' necrosis factor blockers (TNF): The cell protein TNF acts as an inflammatory agent in ''rheumatoid arthritis''. There is some evidence that TNF blockers can also be helpful in reactive arthritis.''Reactive arthritis has been reported in association with ''HIV'' infection (''AIDS'' virus). In this context, immune-suppression medicine is generally avoided because of the potential for worsening the ''HIV'' disease.''Eye inflammation can be alleviated with anti-inflammatory drops. Some patients with severe iritis require local injections of cortisone to prevent damaging inflammation to the eye, which can lead to ''blindness''.''The inflammation around the penis can be helped by cortisone creams (such as ''Topicort''). When bacteria are discovered in the bowel or urine, antibiotics specific for those bacteria are given.''Exercise'' has shown to help people with arthritis. You should have a physical therapist show you specific exercises for your joints.'  "
What is the prognosis of reactive arthritis?,"'The outlook for reactive arthritis is generally very good. Today, there are many effective treatments. The outlook is best when the disease is diagnosed and treated aggressively early on. When a specific cause is identified and eradicated, it is sometimes possible to completely cure reactive arthritis. Complications, such as eye, skin, or prostate disease, can require comanagement with appropriate specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists, and urologists as well as ''rheumatologists''.'

Is it possible to prevent reactive arthritis?,"'Yes. Reactive arthritis can be prevented, to some extent, by avoiding sexual infection and by storing food properly and cooking it properly.' "
What does the future hold for reactive arthritis?,"'In the future, new medications will be developed that are more specific in the treatment of reactive arthritis. ''Clinical trials'' with long-term antibiotic treatment are under way, and it is possible that these may be especially effective in reactive arthritis that is associated with ''chlamydia'' infection.''The TNF-blockers, such as ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), have potential for treating severe, resistant reactive arthritis.

Facts you should know about reactive arthritis,"   Reactive arthritis involves inflammation of joints due to an infection in another part of your body. The most common triggers are the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Reactive arthritis can occur after genital (venereal) infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or enteric infection (dysentery) with Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, or Clostridium difficile. Reactive arthritis shares many features with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and the arthritis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Reactive arthritis can affect the joints, the spine, the eyes, urinary tract, mouth, colon, and heart. There is no single laboratory test for diagnosing reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 genetic marker is commonly found in the blood. Treatment of reactive arthritis is directed toward the specific body area(s) inflamed or affected."
What is reactive arthritis?,"'Reactive arthritis is a chronic form of inflammatory\xa0arthritis featuring the following three conditions: (1) inflamed joints, (2) inflammation of the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), and (3) inflammation of the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems.''This form of ''joint inflammation'' is called ""reactive arthritis"" because it is felt to involve an immune system that is ""reacting"" to the presence of ''bacterial infections'"" in the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Accordingly, certain people's immune systems are genetically primed to react aberrantly when these areas are exposed to certain bacteria. The aberrant reaction of the immune system leads to spontaneous inflammation in the joints and eyes. This can be confounding to the patient and the doctor when the infection has long passed at the time of presentation with arthritis or eye inflammation.""""Reactive arthritis has, in the past, been referred to as Reiter syndrome (a term that has lost favor because of Dr. Hans Reiter's dubious past, one of enthusiastically embracing Nazi politics and medical abominations). In addition, Reiter syndrome would refer to a specific type of reactive arthritis limiting inflammation to the eyes, urethra, and joints.""'Reactive arthritis most frequently occurs in patients in their 30s or 40s, but it can occur at any age. The form of reactive arthritis that occurs after genital infection (venereal) occurs more frequently in males. The form that develops after bowel infection (dysentery) occurs in equal frequency in males and females.''Reactive arthritis is considered a systemic rheumatic disease. This means it can affect other organs than the joints, causing inflammation in tissues such as the eyes, mouth, skin, kidneys, heart, and ''lungs''. Reactive arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions, such as ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'"", and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause similar disease and inflammation in the spine and other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to inflame the spine, these conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.""'  "
What causes reactive arthritis?,"'As mentioned, reactive arthritis is felt in part to be genetic. There are certain genetic markers that are far more frequent in patients with reactive arthritis than in the normal population. For example, the HLA-B27 gene is commonly seen in patients with reactive arthritis. Even in patients who have the genetic background that predisposes them to developing reactive arthritis, however, exposure to certain infections seems to be required to trigger the onset of the disease.''Reactive arthritis can occur after venereal infections. The most common bacterium that has been associated with this post-venereal form of reactive arthritis is an organism called ''Chlamydia'' trachomatis''. Reactive arthritis also occurs after infectious dysentery, with bacterial organisms in the bowel, such as ''Salmonella'', '' ''Shigella'', ''Yersinia'', ''Campylobacter'', and ''Clostridium difficile''. Typically, the arthritis develops one to three weeks after the onset of the bacterial infection. Reactive arthritis has also been reported associated with bladder infusions of BCG used for treating ''bladder cancer''.' "
What are reactive arthritis risk factors?," Gender: Reactive arthritis is more frequent in men. Age: It is most frequent in people 20-40 years of age. Hereditary factors: There are inherited genes, such as HLA-B27, that increase the risk for developing reactive arthritis."
What are reactive arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of reactive arthritis can be divided into those that affect the joints and those that affect the non-joint areas.''The classic joints that can become inflamed in reactive arthritis are the knees, ankles, and ''feet''. The particular joints involved are usually asymmetric, that is, one side of the body or the other is affected with signs and symptoms, rather than both sides simultaneously. The inflammation leads to ''joint pain'', ''stiffness'', swelling, warmth, and redness. Patients may develop inflammation of entire fingers or toes which can give the appearance of a ""sausage digit."" This feature is also seen in patients with another type of arthritis called ''psoriatic arthritis'' that is associated with ''skin inflammation'' of ''psoriasis''. The arthritis of reactive arthritis can be associated with inflammation of the spine, leading to stiffness and joint\xa0''pain'' in the back or neck (characteristic of all of the spondyloarthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis).''Cartilage can also become inflamed, especially around the breastbone where the ribs meet in the front of the chest; this condition is called ''costochondritis''. Muscles attach to the bones by tendons. In reactive arthritis, the tendon insertion points can become inflamed (''enthesitis''), tender, and painful when exercised. Achilles tendinitis is common with reactive arthritis.''Non-joint areas that become inflamed and cause symptoms of ''pain'' and irritation in patients with reactive arthritis include the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), genitals, urinary tract (urethra, bladder and ''prostate gland''), skin, mouth lining, large bowel, and the ''aorta''.''Inflammation of the white portion of the eye (''conjunctivitis'') and the ''iris'' of the eye (''iritis'') is frequently seen early in reactive arthritis and may be intermittent. When the whites of the eye are inflamed causing conjunctivitis, there may be no pain. When the colored part of the eye (iris) is inflamed, causing iritis and ''uveitis'', it can be very painful and especially worse when looking into bright lights (medically referred to as ''photophobia'').''Urinary tract inflammation commonly involves the urethra, the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This inflammation (''urethritis'') can be associated with burning on urination and/or ''pus drainage'' from the end of the penis. The skin around the penis can become inflamed and peel. The bladder and prostate gland can also become inflamed, leading to an urge to urinate from ''cystitis'' and ''prostatitis'' respectively.''The skin of the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet can develop tiny fluid-filled ''blisters'' that sometimes are filled with old blood. The affected skin can peel and may mimic ''psoriasis''. The classic appearance is medically referred to as keratoderma blennorrhagica. Similar inflammation of the tip of the penis can cause irritating ''rash'' in males, referred to as circinate ''balanitis''.''The mouth can develop open sores (ulcerations) on the hard and soft palate and even on the tongue. These may go unnoticed by the patient, as they are often painless. Inflammation of the large bowel (''colitis'') can cause ''diarrhea'' or pus or ''blood in the stool''. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can be seen in a small percentage of patients who have reactive arthritis. It can lead to failure of the ''aortic valve'' of the heart, which can cause ''heart failure''. The electrical conducting pathway of the heart can also become scarred in reactive arthritis, leading to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) that may require placement of a ''pacemaker'' to regulate the heartbeat.'

What is sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is a disease that results from a specific type of inflammation of tissues of the body. It can appear in almost any body organ, but it starts most often in the lungs or ''lymph nodes''.''The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. The disease can appear suddenly and disappear. Or it can develop gradually and go on to produce symptoms that come and go, sometimes for a lifetime.''As sarcoidosis progresses, microscopic lumps of a specific form of inflammation, called granulomas, appear in the affected tissues. In the majority of cases, these granulomas clear up, either with or without treatment. In the few cases where the granulomas do not heal and disappear, the tissues tend to remain inflamed and become scarred (fibrotic).''Sarcoidosis was first identified over 100 years ago by two dermatologists working independently, Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson in England and Dr. Caesar Boeck in Norway. Sarcoidosis was originally called Hutchinson\'s disease or Boeck\'s disease. Dr. Boeck went on to fashion today\'s name for the disease from the Greek words ""sark"" and ""oid,"" meaning flesh-like. The term describes the skin eruptions that are frequently caused by the illness.'  "
What are causes and risk factors of sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is a spontaneous disease of unknown cause. There are no known predisposing risk factors for developing sarcoidosis.''The immunse system is complex. Basically, B lymphocytes make antibodies to fight against infections, while T-lymphocytes patrol the tissues to fight off invaders in other ways.''The heightened cellular immune response in the diseased tissue is characterized by significant increases in activated T-lymphocytes with certain characteristic cell-surface antigens, as well as in activated alveolar macrophages. This pronounced, localized cellular response is also accompanied by the appearance in the lung of an array of lymphocyte produced mediators generally called cytokines that are thought to contribute to the disease process. These include interleukin-1, interleukin-2, B-cell growth factor, B-cell differentiation factor, fibroblast growth factor, and fibronectin. Because a number of lung diseases follow respiratory tract infections, ascertaining whether a virus can be implicated in the events leading to sarcoidosis remains an important area of research.''Some recent observations seem to provide suggestive leads on this question. In these studies, the genes of ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), a common disease-causing virus, were introduced into lymphocytes, and the expression of the viral genes was studied. It was found that the viral genes were expressed both during acute infection of the cells and when the virus was not replicating in the cells. However, this expression seemed to take place only when the T-cells were activated by some injurious event. In addition, the product of a ''CMV'' gene was found capable of activating the gene in alveolar macrophages responsible for the production of interleukin-1. Since interleukin-1 levels are found to increase in alveolar macrophages from patients with sarcoidosis, this suggests that certain viral genes can enhance the production of inflammatory components associated with sarcoidosis. Whether these findings implicate viral infections in the disease process in sarcoidosis is unclear.' "
What are signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis?,"'Shortness of breath'' (dyspnea) and a ''cough'"" that won't go away can be among the first symptoms of sarcoidosis. But sarcoidosis can also show up suddenly with the appearance of skin ""'rashes''. Red ''bumps'' (''erythema nodosum'') on the face, arms, or shins and inflammation of the eyes are also common symptoms and signs.''It is not unusual, however, for sarcoidosis symptoms to be more general. ''Weight loss'', ''fatigue'', ''night sweats'', ''fever'', or just an overall feeling of ill health can also be clues to the disease.''In addition to the lungs and lymph nodes, the body organs more likely than others to be affected by sarcoidosis are the ''liver'', skin, ''heart'', nervous system, and kidneys, in that order of frequency. Patients can have symptoms related to the specific organ affected, they can have only general symptoms, or they can be without any symptoms whatsoever. Symptoms also can vary according to how long the illness has been under way, where the granulomas are forming, how much tissue has become affected, and whether the granulomatous process is still active.'""Even when there are no symptoms, a doctor can sometimes detect signs of sarcoidosis during a routine examination, usually a chest X-ray, or when checking out another complaint. The patient's age and race or ethnic group can raise an additional red flag that a sign or symptom of illness could be related to sarcoidosis. Enlargement of the salivary or tear-producing glands and ""'cysts'' in bone tissue are also among sarcoidosis signals.''The lungs are usually the first site involved in sarcoidosis. Indeed, about nine out of 10 sarcoidosis patients have some type of lung problem, with nearly one-third of these patients showing some respiratory symptoms -- usually ''coughing'', either dry or with ''phlegm'', and dyspnea. Occasionally, patients have ''chest pain'' and a feeling of ''tightness in the chest''.''It is thought that sarcoidosis of the lungs begins with inflammation of the alveoli (alveolitis), the tiny sac-like air spaces in the lungs where carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged. Alveolitis either clears up spontaneously or leads to granuloma formation. Eventually, fibrosis can form, causing the usually flexible and clompliant lung to stiffen and making ''breathing'' even more difficult.''Eye disease occurs in about 20%-30% of patients with sarcoidosis, particularly in children who get the disease. Almost any part of the eye can be affected -- the membranes of the eyelids, ''cornea'', outer coat of the eyeball (sclera), retina, and ''lens''. The eye involvement can start with no symptoms at all or with reddening or ''watery eyes''. In a few cases, ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and ''blindness'' can result.''The skin is affected in 20% to 35% of sarcoidosis patients. Skin sarcoidosis is usually marked by small, raised patches on the face. Occasionally, the patches are purplish in color and larger. Patches can also appear on limbs, face, and buttocks.''Other symptoms include the red bumps of\xa0''erythema nodosum'', mostly on the legs and often accompanied by ''arthritis'' in the ankles, elbows, wrists, and hands. Erythema nodosum usually goes away, but other skin problems can persist. Virtually any organ or organ system can be involved in sarcoidosis.''Occasionally, sarcoidosis can lead to nervous system problems. For example, sarcoid granulomas can appear in the brain, spinal cord, and facial and optic nerves. Facial ''paralysis'' and other symptoms of nerve damage call for prompt treatment with medications such as high doses of cortisone (see below). Rarely, the heart may be involved in sarcoidosis, which can be a serious problem. People with sarcoidosis can have ''depression'' that is unrelated to the activity of the disease and is felt to be, in part, because of a misdirected immune system.''Symptoms can appear suddenly and then disappear. Sometimes, however, they can continue over a lifetime.'  "
Who gets sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis was once considered a rare disease. We now know that it is a common chronic illness that appears all over the world. Indeed, it is the most common of the scarring lung disorders and occurs often enough in the United States for Congress to have declared a national Sarcoidosis Awareness Day in 1990.''Anyone can get sarcoidosis. It occurs in all races and in both sexes. Nevertheless, the risk is greater if you are a young black adult, especially a black woman, or of Scandinavian, German, Irish, or Puerto Rican origin. No one knows why.''Because sarcoidosis can escape diagnosis or be mistaken for several other diseases, we can only guess at how many people are affected. The best estimate today is that about 10 in 100,000 white people in the United States have sarcoidosis. Among black people, it occurs more frequently, in probably 35 out of 100,000 people. Some scientists, however, believe that these figures greatly underestimate the percentage of the U.S. population with sarcoidosis.''Sarcoidosis mainly affects people between 20-40 years of age. White women are just as likely as white men to get sarcoidosis, but the black female gets sarcoidosis two times as often as the black male. No one knows what causes sarcoidosis.'""Sarcoidosis also appears to be more common and more severe in certain geographic areas. It has long been recognized as a common disease in Scandinavian countries. But it was not until the mid '40s, when a large number of cases were identified during mass chest X-ray screening for the Armed Forces, that its high prevalence was recognized in North America."" "
What are some things we don't know about sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis is currently thought to be associated with an abnormal immune response. It is not known whether the trigger that initiates the immune disturbance is a foreign substance, chemical, drug, virus, or some other substance.''In general, more than half of the time, sarcoidosis appears briefly and heals naturally, often without the patient knowing or doing anything about it. Some sarcoidosis patients are left with permanent lung damage. In 10%-15% of the patients, sarcoidosis can become chronic.''When either the granulomas or fibrosis seriously affect the function of a vital organ -- the lungs, heart, nervous system, liver, or kidneys, for example -- sarcoidosis can be fatal. This occurs 1% to 5% of the time. Some people are more at risk than others. No one knows why.'""No one can predict how sarcoidosis will progress in an individual patient. The patient's symptoms, race, and the doctor's findings can give some clues. For example, a sudden onset of general symptoms, such as ""'weight loss'' or feeling generally ill, are usually taken to mean that the course of sarcoidosis will be relatively short and mild. Dyspnea and possibly skin sarcoidosis often indicate that the sarcoidosis will be more chronic and severe.''White patients are more likely to develop the milder form of the disease. Black people tend to develop the more chronic and severe form.''Sarcoidosis rarely develops before the age of 10 or after the age of 60. However, the illness -- with or without symptoms -- has been reported in younger as well as in older people. When symptoms do appear in these age groups, the symptoms are those that are more general in nature, for example, ''tiredness'', sluggishness, coughing, and a general feeling of ill health.' "
What do we know about sarcoidosis? Is sarcoidosis contagious or hereditary?,"'Much about sarcoidosis remains unknown. Nevertheless, if you have the disease, you can be reassured about several things. Sarcoidosis is usually not crippling. It often goes away by itself, with most cases healing in 24-36 months. Even when sarcoidosis lasts longer, most patients can go about their lives as usual. Sarcoidosis is not a ''cancer''. It is not ''contagious'', and your friends and family will not catch it from you. Although it can occur in families, there is no evidence that sarcoidosis is passed from parents to children.' "
What types of doctors treat sarcoidosis?,"'Because sarcoidosis can involve inflammation in a variety of organs of the body, many types of doctors can be involved in the treatment of patients with sarcoidosis. Patients with sarcoidosis are best treated by a lung specialist or a doctor who has a special interest in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis specialists are usually located at major research centers.''Doctors who treat sarcoidosis include primary-care providers as well as internists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, ''rheumatologists'', dermatologists, and neurologists.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose sarcoidosis?,"""Preliminary diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on the patient's medical history, routine tests, a physical examination, and a chest X-ray.""'The doctor confirms the diagnosis of sarcoidosis by eliminating other diseases with similar features. These include such granulomatous diseases as berylliosis (a disease resulting from exposure to beryllium metal), ''tuberculosis'"", farmer's lung disease (""'hypersensitivity pneumonitis''), ''fungal infections'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''rheumatic fever'', and ''cancer'' of the lymph nodes (''lymphoma'').' "
What do laboratory tests for sarcoidosis show?,"'While no single test can be relied on for a correct diagnosis of sarcoidosis, many types of tests are useful. ''X-rays'' and blood tests are usually the first procedures the doctor will order. Pulmonary function tests often provide clues to diagnosis. Other tests may also be used, some more often than others.''Many of the tests that the doctor calls on to help diagnose sarcoidosis can also help the doctor follow the progress of the disease and determine whether the sarcoidosis is getting better or worse.''The chest X-ray is often helpful to give the doctor a picture of the lungs, heart, as well as the surrounding tissues containing lymph nodes (where infection-fighting white blood cells form) and give the first indication of sarcoidosis. For example, a swelling of the lymph glands between the two lungs can show up on an X-ray. When sarcoidosis becomes more advanced, an X-ray can also show scarring in affected areas of the lungs.''By performing a variety of tests called pulmonary function tests (PFT), the doctor can find out how well the lungs are doing their job of expanding and exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood. The lungs of sarcoidosis patients cannot handle these tasks as well as they should; this is because granulomas and fibrosis of lung tissue decrease lung capacity and disturb the normal flow of gases between the lungs and the blood. One PFT procedure calls for the patient to breathe into a machine, called a spirometer. It is a mechanical device that records changes in the lung size as air is inhaled and exhaled, as well as the time it takes the patient to do this.''Blood analyses can evaluate the number and types of blood cells in the body and how well the cells are functioning. They can also measure the levels of various blood proteins known to be involved in immunological activities, and they can show increases in serum calcium levels and abnormal ''liver function'' that often accompany sarcoidosis.''Blood tests can measure a blood substance called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Because the cells that make up granulomas secrete large amounts of ACE, the enzyme levels are often high in patients with sarcoidosis. ACE levels, however, are not always high in sarcoidosis patients, and increased ACE levels can also occur in other illnesses.''This uses an instrument called a bronchoscope -- a long, narrow tube with a light at the end -- to wash out, or lavage, cells and other materials from inside the lungs. This wash fluid is then examined for the amount of various cells and other substances that reflect inflammation and immune activity in the lungs. A high number of white blood cells in this fluid usually indicate an inflammation in the lungs.''Transbronchial biopsy allows microscopic examination of specimens of lung tissue obtained with a bronchoscope. A transbronchial biopsy demonstrating evidence of the type of granuloma found in sarcoidosis is considered the definitive test today.'""In this procedure, the doctor injects the radioactive chemical element gallium-67 into the patient's vein. The gallium collects at places in the body affected by sarcoidosis and other inflammatory conditions. Two days after the injection, the body is scanned for radioactivity. Increases in gallium uptake at any site in the body indicate that inflammatory activity has developed at the site and give an idea of which tissue, and how much tissue, has been affected. However, since any type of inflammation causes gallium uptake, a positive gallium scan does not necessarily mean that the patient has sarcoidosis. This test is rarely used today.""'The PET (positron emission tomography) scan injects a small amount of radioactive glucose and tracks where it accumulates. While granulomas do accumulate glucose preferentiall, so do other forms of inflammation and other conditions.''This test involves injecting a standardized preparation of sarcoid tissue material into the skin. On the one hand, a unique lump formed at the point of injection is considered positive for sarcoidosis. On the other hand, the test result is not always positive even if the patient has sarcoidosis.''The Kveim test is not used often in the United States because no test material has been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, a few hospitals and clinics may have some standardized test preparation prepared privately for their own use.''An instrument called a slit lamp, which permits examination of the inside of the eye, can be used to detect silent damage from sarcoidosis.' "
What is the treatment for sarcoidosis?,"'Fortunately, many patients with sarcoidosis require no treatment. Symptoms, after all, are usually not disabling and do tend to disappear spontaneously.''When therapy is recommended, the main goal is to keep the lungs and other affected body organs working and to relieve symptoms. The disease is considered inactive once the symptoms fade. After many years of experience with treating the disease, ''corticosteroid'' ''drugs'' remain the primary treatment for inflammation and granuloma formation. ''Prednisone'' is probably the corticosteroid most often prescribed today.\xa0''Prednisone often improves the ''cough'' and pulmonary function tests in sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, if the lungs are severely affected by sarcoidosis, scarring develops in them. Prednisone will not clear the established scarring. In those unusual cases where sarcoidosis raises the calcium level in the blood, if lowering calcium and ''vitamin D'' intake is not sufficient to correct this, or the calcium elevation is symptomatic, then Prednisone can be rapidly effective at bringing the calcium level back to normal.'""Because sarcoidosis can disappear even without therapy, even doctors sometimes disagree on when to start the treatment, what dose to prescribe, and how long to continue the medicine. The doctor's decision depends on the organ system involved and how far the inflammation has progressed. If the disease appears to be severe, especially in the lungs, eyes, heart, nervous system, spleen, or kidneys, the doctor may prescribe corticosteroid.""'Corticosteroid treatment usually results in improvement. Symptoms often start up again, however, when it is stopped. Treatment, therefore, may be necessary for several years, sometimes for as long as the disease remains active or to prevent relapse.''Frequent checkups are important so that the doctor can monitor the illness and, if necessary, adjust the treatment.''Corticosteroids'', for example, can have side effects: ''mood swings'', swelling, and ''weight gain'' because the treatment tends to make the body hold on to water; ''high blood pressure''; ''high blood sugar''; and craving for food. Long-term use can affect the stomach, skin, and bones. This situation can bring on ''stomach pain'', an ulcer, or ''acne'' or cause the loss of calcium from bones. However, if the corticosteroid is taken in carefully prescribed low doses, the benefits from the treatment are usually far greater than the problems.''Besides corticosteroid, various other drugs have been tried, but their effectiveness has not been established in controlled studies. These drugs include ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil), ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen''), and D-''penicillamine''. Several drugs such as ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), which might suppress alveolitis by killing the cells that produce granulomas, have also been used. None have been evaluated in controlled ''clinical trials'', and the risk of using these drugs must be compared closely with the benefits in preventing organ damage by the disease. They are not to be used by ''pregnant'' women.''Cyclosporine'', a drug used widely in organ transplants to suppress immune reaction, has been evaluated in one controlled trial. It was found to be unsuccessful. More recently, ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'') has been used successfully in a limited number of patients and seemed to improve lung function and heal skin lesions. ''Infliximab'' (''Remicade'') has been reported recently as effective in treating patients with sarcoidosis.''There are many unanswered questions about sarcoidosis. Identifying the agent that causes the illness, along with the inflammatory mechanisms that set the stage for the alveolitis, granuloma formation, and fibrosis that characterized the disease is the major aim of researchers of sarcoidosis. Development of reliable methods of diagnosis, treatment, and eventually, the ''prevention'' of sarcoidosis is the ultimate goal.''Originally, scientists thought that sarcoidosis was caused by an acquired state of immunological inertness (anergy). This notion was revised when the technique of bronchoalveolar lavage provided access to a vast array of cells and cell-derived mediators operating in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Sarcoidosis is now believed to be associated with a complex mix of immunological disturbances involving simultaneous activation, as well as ''depression'', of certain immunological functions.''Immunological studies on sarcoidosis patients show that many of the immune functions associated with thymus-derived white blood cells, called T-lymphocytes or T-cells, are ''depressed''. The ''depression'' of this cellular component of systemic immune response is expressed in the inability of the patients to evoke a delayed hypersensitivity skin reaction (a positive skin test), when tested by the appropriate foreign substances, or antigen, underneath the skin.''In addition, the blood of sarcoidosis patients contains a reduced number of T-cells. These T-cells do not seem capable of responding normally when treated with substances known to stimulate the growth of laboratory-cultured T-cells. Neither do they produce their normal complement of immunological mediators, cytokines, through which the cells modify the behavior of other cells.''In contrast to the ''depression'' of the cellular immune response, the B-cell activity -- or humoral immune response of sarcoidosis patients is elevated. The humoral immune response is reflected by the production of circulating antibodies against a variety of exogenous antigens, including common ''viruses''. This humoral component of systemic immune response is mediated by another class of lymphocytes known as B-lymphocytes, or ''B-cells'', because they originate in the bone marrow.''In another indication of heightened humoral response, sarcoidosis patients seem prone to develop autoantibodies (antibodies against endogenous antigens) similar to rheumatoid factors.''With access to the cells and cell products in the lung tissue compartments through the bronchoalveolar technique, it also has become possible for researchers to complement the above investigations at the blood level with analysis of local inflammatory and immune events in the lungs. In contrast to what is seen at the systemic level, the cellular immune response in the lungs seems to be heightened rather than depressed.''Currently, thalidomide is being studied as a treatment for sarcoidosis. Future research with viral models may provide clues to the molecular mechanisms that trigger alterations in white blood cell (lymphocyte and macrophage) regulation leading to sarcoidosis.''For difficult-to-treat (refractory) sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis involving the nervous system (neurosarcoidosis), recent research using biologic medications that inhibit ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF-blockers) has been beneficial. The TNF-blockers used were ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') and infliximab (Remicade).'  "
Is it possible to prevent sarcoidosis?,"'The cause of sarcoidosis still remains unknown, so there is at present no known way to prevent or cure this disease. However, doctors have had a great deal of experience in management of the illness. It should be noted that most people with sarcoidosis lead normal lives.''If you have sarcoidosis, you can help yourself by following sensible health measures. You should not smoke. You should also avoid exposure to other substances such as dusts and chemicals that can harm your lungs.''If you have any symptoms of sarcoidosis, see your doctor regularly so that the illness can be watched and, if necessary, treated. Regular checkups with the doctor are important even if there are no symptoms present. Eye examinations by an eye specialist can detect early eye inflammation from sarcoidosis.''Although severe sarcoidosis can reduce the chances of ''becoming pregnant'', particularly for older women, many young women with sarcoidosis have given birth to healthy ''babies'' while on treatment. Patients planning to have a baby should discuss the matter with their doctor. Medical checkups all through ''pregnancy'"" and immediately thereafter are especially important for sarcoidosis patients. In some cases, bed rest is necessary during the last three months of pregnancy. In addition to family and close friends, a number of local lung organizations, other nonprofit health organizations, and self-help groups are available to help patients cope with sarcoidosis. By keeping in touch with them, you can share personal feelings and experiences. Members also share specific information on the latest scientific advances, where to find a sarcoidosis specialist, and how to improve one's self-image.""  "
What is the prognosis of sarcoidosis?,'The prognosis of sarcoidosis is generally very good. The prognosis ultimately depends on the location and severity of involvement with the sarcoid inflammation.'

Facts you should know about scleroderma," Scleroderma is a skin disease of the connective tissue featuring thickened skin that can involve scarring, blood vessel problems, varying degrees of inflammation and pain, and is associated with an overactive immune system. CREST syndrome is a limited form of scleroderma. Patients with scleroderma can have specific antibodies (ANA, anticentromere, or anti-topoisomerase) in their blood that suggest autoimmunity. Treatment of scleroderma is primarily directed toward the particular individual's symptoms."
What is scleroderma?,"""Scleroderma is an autoimmune condition of the connective tissue characterized by skin thickening, spontaneous scarring, blood vessel disease, and varying degrees of inflammation, associated with an overactive immune system. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Scleroderma is characterized by the formation of ""'scar tissue'' (fibrosis) in the skin. This leads to thickness and firmness of involved skin. This may also occur in internal organs such as the kidney.''Scleroderma is classified as localized or widespread (systemic scleroderma with a tendency to affect internal organs). Systemic scleroderma is further divided into limited and diffuse based upon the extent of cutaneous involvement.'  "
What causes scleroderma?,"'The cause of scleroderma is not known. Researchers have found some evidence that certain genes are important hereditary factors, but the environment seems to also play a role. The result is activation of the immune system in a susceptible individual, causing damage to the inner lining of tiny blood vessels and injury to tissues that result in ''scar'' tissue formation and the accumulation of excess collagen.''The fact that genes seem to cause a predisposition to developing scleroderma means that inheritance at least plays a partial role. It is not unusual to find other autoimmune diseases in families of scleroderma patients. Some evidence for the role genes may play in leading to the development of scleroderma comes from the study of Choctaw Native Americans who are the group with the highest reported prevalence of the disease. The condition is more frequent in females than in males.' "
What are risk factors for developing scleroderma?,"'Because of the known association of certain genes with scleroderma, it may be that combinations of exposures to environmental factors and possibly certain ''viruses'' may trigger the development of scleroderma in genetically susceptible people. The precise interplay of pathology leading to blood vessel damage, scar and collagen accumulation, and autoimmunity is unclear.' "
How do health care professionals classify scleroderma?,"'Scleroderma can be classified in terms of the degree and location of the skin and organ involvement. Accordingly, scleroderma has been categorized into two major groups, localized scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis is further subdivided into either diffuse or limited forms based on the location and extent of cutaneous involvement.''Localized scleroderma skin changes are in isolated areas, either as morphea patches or linear scleroderma. Morphea is scleroderma that is localized to a patchy area of the skin that becomes hardened and slightly pigmented. Sometimes morphea can cause multiple oval-shaped lesions in the skin. Morphea is not associated with disease elsewhere within the body, only in the involved skin areas. Linear scleroderma is scleroderma that is localized usually to a lower extremity, frequently presenting as a strip of hardening skin down the leg of a child. Linear scleroderma in children can stunt bone growth of the affected limb. Sometimes linear scleroderma is associated with a ""satellite"" area of a patch of localized scleroderma skin, such as on the abdomen.''The widespread type of scleroderma involves internal organs in addition to the skin. This type, called systemic sclerosis, is subcategorized by the extent of skin involvement as either diffuse or limited. The diffuse form of scleroderma (diffuse systemic sclerosis) involves symmetric thickening of skin of the extremities, face, and trunk (chest, back, abdomen, or flanks) that can rapidly progress to hardening after an early inflammatory phase. Organ disease can occur early on and be serious and significantly decrease life expectancy. Organs affected include the ''esophagus'', bowels, and scarring (fibrosis) of the ''lungs'', ''heart'', and kidneys. ''High blood pressure'' can be troublesome and can lead to ''kidney failure'' (renal crisis).''The limited form of scleroderma tends to have far less skin involvement with skin thickening confined to the skin of the fingers, hands, and face. The skin changes and other features of disease tend to occur more slowly than in the diffuse form. Because characteristic clinical features can occur in patients with the limited form of scleroderma, this form has taken another name that is composed of the first initials of the common components. Thus, this form is also called the ""CREST"" variant of scleroderma. CREST syndrome represents the following features:''C''...Calcinosis refers to the formation of tiny calcium deposits in the skin. This is seen as hard whitish areas in the superficial skin, commonly overlying the elbows, knees, or fingers. These firm deposits can be tender, can become infected, and can fall off spontaneously or require surgical removal. This is the least common of the CREST scleroderma variant features.''R''...'""Raynaud's""' phenomenon refers to the spasm of the tiny arterial vessels supplying blood to the fingers, toes, nose, tongue, or ears. These areas turn white, then blue, then red after exposure to extremes of ''cold'', or even sometimes with extremes of heat or emotional upset. This can lead to tiny areas of damage to the tips of the fingers (digital ulcers) or larger areas of dead skin on the ends of the fingers.''E''...Esophagus disease in scleroderma is characterized by dysmotility (poorly functioning muscle of the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, the swallowing tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to an abnormally wide esophagus that allows stomach acid to backflow into the esophagus to cause ''heartburn'', inflammation, and potentially scarring that narrows the esophagus. This can eventually lead to difficulty in passing food from the mouth through the esophagus into the stomach. Symptoms of heartburn are treated aggressively in patients with scleroderma in order to prevent injury to the esophagus.''S''...Sclerodactyly is the localized thickening and tightness of the skin of the fingers or toes. This can give them a ""shiny"" and slightly puffy appearance. The tightness can cause severe limitation of motion of the fingers and toes. These skin changes generally progress much slower than those of patients with the diffuse form of scleroderma.''T''...''Telangiectasias'' are tiny red areas, frequently on the face, hands, and in the mouth behind the lips. These areas blanch when they are pressed upon and represent widened (dilated) capillaries.''Patients with limited systemic sclerosis can have variations of CREST with differing manifestations, for example, CRST, REST, or ST. Occasionally, patients can have initial illness with features of CREST that evolve into the diffuse form of scleroderma. Some patients have ""overlaps"" of scleroderma and other connective tissue diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and ''polymyositis''. When features of scleroderma are present along with features of ''polymyositis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and certain abnormal blood tests, the condition is referred to as ''mixed connective tissue disease'' (''MCTD'').'  "
What are scleroderma symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of scleroderma depend on the type of scleroderma present and the extent of external and internal involvement in the individual affected. Because scleroderma can involve the skin, esophagus, blood vessels, kidneys, lungs, ''blood pressure'', and bowels, the symptoms it causes can affect many areas of the body.''Scleroderma affects the skin to cause local or widespread signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, tenderness, ''itching'', and ''pain'"") that can lead to skin tightness or hardening and a mask-like face. These skin changes can be widespread, but it's most common for them to affect the fingers, ""'feet'', face, and neck. This can lead to decreased range of motion of the fingers, toes, and jaw. Tiny areas of calcification (calcinosis), while not common, can sometimes be noticed as hard nodules at the tips of the elbows, knees, in the fingers, or over joints.''Scleroderma commonly affects the esophagus leading to heartburn. This is directly a result of stomach acid flowing back up into the esophagus. Sometimes this can lead to scarring of the esophagus, resulting in narrowing with ''difficulty swallowing'' food and/or localized pain in the central chest.''Blood vessels that can be affected include the tiny arterioles of the finger tips, toes, and elsewhere. These vessels can have a tendency to spasm when the areas are exposed to cold, leading to whiteness, blueness, and redness of involved fingers, toes, and sometimes nose or ears. These color changes are referred to as '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. This may precede the development of other features of scleroderma by years. It should be noted that Raynaud's phenomenon can be an isolated disease without any other disease such as scleroderma developing. Raynaud's phenomenon can cause inadequate supply of oxygen to the involved tips of fingers or toes, causing tiny ulcers or blackened (dead) skin. Sometimes Raynaud's phenomenon is also associated with tingling. Other blood vessels that can be involved in scleroderma are the tiny capillaries of the face, lips, mouth, and fingers. These capillaries widen (dilate), forming tiny, red blanching spots, called ""'telangiectasias''. Rarely, telangiectasias in the stomach (called ""watermelon stomach"" because of its appearance) can present a serious risk of bleeding and require close monitoring by gastroenterologists.''Elevated blood pressure is potentially serious and can lead to kidney damage (renal crisis). Symptoms include ''headache'', ''fatigue'', and in severe cases, ''stroke''. Blood pressure monitoring and control is essential.''Inflammation of the lungs in scleroderma can cause scarring, resulting in ''shortness of breath'', especially with physical exertion. Elevated pressure in the arteries to the lungs (''pulmonary hypertension'') can also cause shortness of breath and difficulty getting an adequate breath with activity.''Scleroderma involvement in the heart can lead to damage to heart muscle, irregular heart rhythms, abnormal electrical activity of the heart, and inflammation around the heart (''pericarditis'').''Scleroderma affecting the large bowel (colon) most often causes ''constipation'' but can also lead to cramping and ''diarrhea''. When this is severe, complete ''stool'' blockage (fecal impaction) can result.'  "
How do health care professionals make a diagnosis of scleroderma?,"'The diagnosis of the scleroderma syndrome is based on the detection of the clinical features of the illness. In addition, nearly all patients with scleroderma have blood tests that suggest autoimmunity and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are usually detectable. A particular antibody, the anticentromere antibody, is found almost exclusively in the limited, or CREST, form of systemic sclerosis. Anti-Scl 70 antibody (antitopoisomerase I antibody) is most often seen in patients with the diffuse form of systemic sclerosis.''Other tests are used to evaluate the presence or extent of any internal disease. These may include upper and lower gastrointestinal tests to evaluate the stomach and bowels, chest ''X-rays'', lung function testing (pulmonary function test), and CAT scanning to examine the lungs, ''EKG'' and echocardiograms, and sometimes heart catheterization to evaluate the pressure in the arteries of the heart and lungs for ''pulmonary hypertension''.' "
What are medical treatments for scleroderma?,"'Treatment of scleroderma is directed toward the individual features affecting different areas of the body.''Aggressive treatments of elevations in blood pressure have been extremely important in preventing ''kidney failure''. Blood pressure medications, particularly the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of ''drugs'', such as ''lisinopril'', are frequently used.''Some research indicates that ''colchicine'' can be helpful in decreasing the inflammation and tenderness that periodically accompanies the calcinosis nodules in the skin. Skin ''itching'' can be relieved with lotions (emollients) such as Eucerin, Lubriderm, and Curel.'""Mild Raynaud's phenomenon may require only hand warming and protection. Low-dose ""'aspirin'' is often added to prevent tiny ''blood clots'"" in the fingers, especially in patients with a history of fingertip ulcerations. Moderate Raynaud's phenomenon can be helped by medications that open up the arteries, such as ""'nifedipine'' (''Procardia'', Adalat), ''nicardipine'' (''Cardene''), and ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem''), or with topical ''nitroglycerin'' applied to the most affected digit (most effective on the sides of the digit where the arteries are). Gently applied finger splinting can protect tender tissues. (It is important to not constrict the tiny arteries on the sides of the fingers when protecting them with splints, ''braces'', or band aid materials.) A class of medications that is typically used for ''depression'', called serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), can sometimes improve the circulation of the affected digit. Drugs that constrict blood vessels, such as pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed'' ''decongestant'""), should be avoided. Severe Raynaud's phenomenon can require surgical procedures, such as those to interrupt the nerves of the finger that stimulate constriction of the blood vessels (digital sympathectomy). Ulcerations of the fingers can require topical or oral antibiotics.""'Esophagus irritation and heartburn can be relieved with ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium''), or ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''). Antacids can also be helpful. Elevating the head of the bed can reduce the back flow of acid into the esophagus that causes inflammation and heartburn. Avoiding ''caffeine'' and ''cigarette smoking'' also helps. Of note, there is an increased risk of developing ''lung cancer'' in people with scleroderma. This ''cancer'' risk is even greater in those who smoke.''Constipation'', cramping, and ''diarrhea'' are sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin), ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', Pce, Pediazole, Ilosone), ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''), or ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''). Increased fluid intake and ''fiber'' intake are good general measures to take to reduce these symptoms. A variety of medications that promote movement of the bowels are available.''Irritated, ''itchy'' ''dry skin'' can be helped by emollients such as Lubriderm, Eucerin, or Curel.''Telangiectasias, such as those on the face, can be treated with local laser therapy. Sun exposure should be minimized as it can worsen telangiectasias. Telangiectasias from watermelon stomach can require laser treatments to the stomach.''Approximately 10% of patients with the CREST variant develop elevated pressures in the blood vessels to the lungs (pulmonary ''hypertension''). Abnormally elevated blood pressure of the arteries supplying the lungs is often treated with calcium antagonist medications, such as nifedipine (Procardia), and blood-thinning drugs (anticoagulation). More severe pulmonary ''hypertension'' can be helped by continuous intravenous infusion or ''inhalation'' of prostacyclin (Iloprost). Taken by mouth, ''bosentan'' (''Tracleer'') is used to treat pulmonary ''hypertension''. In addition, ''sildenafil'' (''Revatio'') and ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis'') are approved to treat pulmonary hypertension.''Additionally, medicines are used to suppress the overly active immune system that seems to be spontaneously causing the disease in organs. Immunosuppressants used for this purpose include D-''penicillamine'', ''azathioprine'' (Imuran, Azasan), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). Serious inflammation of the lungs (alveolitis) can require immune suppression with ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'') along with ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''). The optimal treatment of scleroderma lung disease is an area of active research. Stem-cell transplantation is being explored as a possible option.''No medicine has been found to be universally effective for patients with scleroderma. In an individual patient, the illness may be mild and not require treatments. In some, the disease is ravaging, relentless, and can lead to death. Because blood vessel damage is a primary part of the pathology of scleroderma, patients with this condition must not smoke.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with scleroderma?,"""A patient's prognosis is optimized with close monitoring of overall health status and treatment of complications, especially elevated blood pressure. This can involve medical subspecialists, including ""'rheumatologists'', pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists. Research indicates that the critical period of organ risk is generally within the first three years of skin involvement. This means that patients can be reassured that their risk of life-threatening organ complications is significantly less after three years of having skin symptoms and not having internal organ problems.''Patients with diffuse skin involvement tend to do worse than those with limited skin involvement. Those with limited disease of the skin can develop serious lung scarring (''interstitial lung disease'') and pulmonary artery hypertension even after a decade of disease. Lung disease is the leading cause of death. Those with poor pulmonary function tests can have worse outcomes.''Scleroderma continues to challenge medical scientists. Researchers are evaluating the effectiveness of ''thalidomide'' (''Thalomid'') for the treatment of scleroderma. More sensitive tests to detect early lung disease of scleroderma are also being evaluated. Ongoing research into new medications for pulmonary hypertension are in ''clinical trials''. Researchers are also evaluating the possible role of stem-cell transplantation for certain serious forms of scleroderma.''Many researchers are investigating the roles of various cell messengers, called cytokines, in causing scleroderma. Researchers are also currently studying a hormone of ''pregnancy'', called relaxin, for the treatment of scleroderma. Preliminary results suggest that it may improve scleroderma. Relaxin normally loosens the ligaments of the pelvis and ripens the womb for ''childbirth''. How it might work in scleroderma is unclear.''It is clear that our understanding of the effects of the immune system in scleroderma is greatly improving. Many clinical ''research trials'' are under way to evaluate potential treatments for various aspects of the disease to improve the prognosis for patients with scleroderma. Further research supported by the Scleroderma Foundation, ''Arthritis'' Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health will lead to better understanding the illness and more optimal care for patients with scleroderma.' "
Is it possible to prevent scleroderma?,'There is no ''prevention'' method or ''diet'' to avoid or decrease the risk of scleroderma.' 
What is Sjögren's syndrome?,"""Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes. Autoimmune diseases feature the abnormal production of extra antibodies in the blood that are directed against various tissues of the body. The misdirected immune system in autoimmunity tends to lead to inflammation of tissues. This particular autoimmune illness features inflammation and dysfunction in glands of the body that are responsible for producing tears and saliva. Inflammation of the glands that produce tears (lacrimal glands) leads to decreased water production for tears and ""'dry eyes''. Inflammation of the glands that produce the saliva in the mouth (salivary glands, including the parotid glands) leads to decreased saliva production and ''dry mouth'' and dry lips.'""Sjögren's syndrome with gland inflammation (resulting in ""'dry eyes'' and mouth, etc.) that is not associated with another ''connective tissue disease'"" is referred to as primary Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome that is also associated with a connective tissue disease, such as ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', or ''scleroderma'"", is referred to as secondary Sjögren's syndrome. Dryness of eyes and mouth, in patients with or without Sjögren's syndrome, is sometimes referred to as sicca syndrome.""  "
What causes Sjögren's syndrome?,"""While the exact cause of Sjögren's syndrome is not known, there is growing scientific support for genetic (""'inherited'"") factors. The genetic background of Sjögren's syndrome patients is an active area of research. The illness is sometimes found in other family members. It is also found more commonly in families that have members with other autoimmune illnesses, such as ""'systemic lupus erythematosus'', autoimmune ''thyroid disease'', type I ''diabetes'"", etc. Most patients with Sjögren's syndrome are female."" "
What are risk factors for developing Sjögren's syndrome?,"""The main risk factor for the development of Sjögren's syndrome is being a member of a family that is already characterized as having autoimmune illnesses. This does not mean that it is predictable that a member of a family with known autoimmunity will develop the disease, only that is more likely than if there were no family members with known autoimmunity. Accordingly, it is likely that certain genes that are inherited from ancestors can predispose one to the development of Sjögren's syndrome. It should also be noted that Sjögren's syndrome can also be sporadic and occur in a person from a family with no known autoimmunity."" "
What are Sjögren's syndrome symptoms and signs?,"""Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome can involve the glands, as above, but there are also possible effects of the illness involving other organs of the body (extraglandular manifestations).""'When the tear gland (lacrimal gland) is inflamed from Sjögren\'s, the resulting eye dryness can progressively lead to symptoms such as eye irritation, decreased tear production, a ""gritty"" sensation, eye infection, and serious ''abrasion'' of the dome of the eye (''cornea''). Dry eyes can lead to infections of the eyes and inflammation of the eyelids (''blepharitis''). The condition of having dry eyes is medically referred to as xerophthalmia. When the eyes become inflamed from dryness, it is referred to as keratoconjunctivitis sicca.''Inflammation of the salivary glands can lead to the following symptoms and signs:''Dry lips often accompany the mouth dryness.

How do health care professionals diagnose Sjögren's syndrome?,"""The diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome involves noting criterion such as dryness of the eyes and mouth. Significant dryness of the eyes can be determined in the doctor's office by testing the eye's ability to wet a small testing paper strip placed under the ""'eyelid'"" (Schirmer's test using Schirmer tear test strips). More sophisticated testing can be done by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).""""Sjögren's syndrome salivary glands can become larger and harden or become tender. Salivary-gland inflammation can be detected by radiologic nuclear medicine salivary scans. Also, the diminished ability of the salivary glands to produce saliva can be measured with salivary flow testing. The diagnosis is strongly supported by abnormal findings of a biopsy of salivary-gland tissue.""""The glands of the lower lip are occasionally used for a biopsy sample of the salivary-gland tissue in the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. The lower lip salivary-gland biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the surgeon making a tiny incision on the inner part of the lower lip to expose and remove a sample of the tiny salivary glands within.""""Patients with Sjögren's syndrome typically produce a variety of extra antibodies against body tissues (autoantibodies).

Low red blood count (''anemia'') and abnormal blood levels of markers of inflammation (''sedimentation rate'', ''C-reactive protein'') are seen.' "
What is the treatment for Sjögren's syndrome? Will changes to one's diet improve Sjögren's syndrome symptoms and signs?,"""The treatment of patients with Sjögren's syndrome is directed toward the particular areas of the body that are involved and ""'prevention'"" of complications such as infection. There is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome.""'Dryness of the eyes can be helped by artificial tears, using eye-lubricant ointments at night, and minimizing the use of hair dryers. When dryness becomes more significant, the ophthalmologist can plug the tear duct closed so that tears cover the eye longer. ''Cyclosporine'' eyedrops (''Restasis'') are approved medicated eyedrops that can reduce the inflammation of the tear glands, thereby improving their function. Signs of eye infection (''conjunctivitis''), such as pus or excessive redness or pain, should be evaluated by the doctor. Dietary addition of ''flaxseed'' oil may also benefit eye dryness. ''Vitamin D'' supplementation may be beneficial, especially in those who have insufficient ''vitamin D'' blood levels.''The ''dry mouth'' can be helped by drinking plenty of fluids, humidifying air, and good dental care to avoid dental decay. The glands can be stimulated to produce saliva by sucking on sugarless lemon drops or ''glycerin'' swabs. Additional treatments for the symptom of dry mouth are prescription medications that are saliva ''stimulants'', such as ''pilocarpine'' (''Salagen'') and ''cevimeline'' (''Evoxac''). These medications should be avoided by people with certain ''heart'' diseases, ''asthma'', or ''glaucoma''. Artificial saliva preparations can ease many of the problems associated with dry mouth. Many of these types of agents are available as ''over-the-counter products'', including ''toothpaste'', gum, and mouthwash (Biotene). ''Numoisyn'' Liquid and lozenges are also available for the treatment of dry mouth. ''Vitamin E'' oil has been used with some success.

Facts you should know about lupus," Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. SLE is characterized by the production of unusual antibodies in the blood. The cause(s) of systemic lupus erythematosus is (are) unknown, however, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs all may play some role. Lupus symptoms and signs includebutterfly-shaped rash on the face,appetite loss,joint pain,hair loss,fever,fatigue,photosensitivity,Raynaud's phenomenon,pleuritis, andpericarditis. butterfly-shaped rash on the face, appetite loss, joint pain, hair loss, fever, fatigue, photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Up to 10% of people with lupus isolated to the skin will develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). Eleven criteria help health care professionals to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity with anti-inflammatory medications for those with mild symptoms and corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) for those with more severe lupus. People with systemic lupus erythematosus can prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure, not abruptly discontinuing medications, and monitoring their condition with their doctor."
What is systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the different types of lupus?,"""Lupus is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of various tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, such as bacteria and other foreign microbes. One of the ways that the immune system fights infections is by producing antibodies that bind to the microbes. People with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. These antibodies are referred to as autoantibodies.""'Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can affect tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas. Sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin, ''heart'', ''lungs'', kidneys, joints, and/or nervous system. When only the skin is involved by ''rash'', the condition is called lupus ''dermatitis'' or cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that can be isolated to the skin, without internal disease, is called discoid lupus erythematosus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).''Both discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus are more common in women than men (about eight times more common). The disease can affect all ages but most commonly begins from 20-45 years of age. Statistics demonstrate that lupus is somewhat more frequent in African Americans and people of Chinese and Japanese descent.' "
What are risk factors and causes of lupus? Is lupus hereditary? Is lupus contagious?,"'The precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. ''Inherited'' genes, viruses, ultraviolet light, and certain medications may all play some role.''Lupus is not caused by an infectious microorganism and is not ''contagious'' from one person to another.''Genetic factors increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and autoimmune ''thyroid disorders'' are more common among relatives of people with lupus than the general population. Moreover, it is possible to have more than one autoimmune disease in the same individual. Therefore, ""overlap"" syndromes of lupus and ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or lupus and ''scleroderma'', etc., can occur.''Some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. Sometimes, ''symptoms of lupus'' can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure.''It also is known that some women with systemic lupus erythematosus can experience worsening of their symptoms prior to their menstrual periods. This phenomenon, together with the female predominance of systemic lupus erythematosus, suggests that female hormones play an important role in the expression of SLE. This hormonal relationship is an active area of ongoing study by scientists.''Research has demonstrated evidence that a key enzyme\'s failure to dispose of dying cells may contribute the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. The enzyme, DNase1, normally eliminates what is called ""garbage DNA"" and other cellular debris by chopping them into tiny fragments for easier disposal. Researchers turned off the DNase1 gene in mice. The mice appeared healthy at birth, but after six to eight months, the majority of mice without DNase1 showed signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, a genetic mutation in a gene that could disrupt the body\'s cellular waste disposal may be involved in the initiation of systemic lupus erythematosus.' "
What is drug-induced lupus?,"'Dozens of medications have been reported to trigger SLE. However, more than 90% of cases of ""drug-induced lupus"" occurs as a side effect of one of the following six drugs: ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline'') is used for ''high blood pressure''; ''quinidine'' (''Quinidine Gluconate'', ''Quinidine Sulfate'') and ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl; Procan-SR; Procanbid) are used for ''abnormal heart rhythms''; ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'') is used for ''epilepsy''; ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid) is used for ''tuberculosis''; and d-''penicillamine'' (used for ''rheumatoid arthritis'  "
What are lupus symptoms and signs?,"'People with SLE can develop different combinations of symptoms and organ involvement.''Common lupus complaints and symptoms and signs include''Complications of organ involvement can lead to further symptoms that depend on the organ affected and severity of the disease.''SLE-associated skin manifestations can sometimes lead to scarring. In discoid lupus, only the skin is typically involved. The skin rash in discoid lupus often is found on the face and ''scalp''. It usually is red and may have raised borders. Discoid lupus ''rashes'' are usually painless and do not ''itch'', but scarring can cause permanent ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Over time, 5%-10% of those with discoid lupus may develop SLE.''Over half of the people with SLE develop a characteristic red, flat facial rash over the ''bridge'' of their nose. Because of its shape, it is frequently referred to as the ""butterfly rash"" of SLE. The rash is painless and does not ''itch''. The facial rash, along with inflammation in other organs, can be precipitated or worsened by exposure to sunlight, a condition called photosensitivity. This photosensitivity can be accompanied by worsening of inflammation throughout the body, called a ""flare"" of the disease.''Typically, with treatment, this rash can heal without permanent scarring.''Most SLE patients will develop arthritis during the course of their illness. Arthritis from SLE commonly involves swelling, ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and even deformity of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and ''feet''. Sometimes, the arthritis of SLE can mimic that of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (another autoimmune disease).''More serious organ involvement with inflammation occurs in the brain, ''liver'', and kidneys. White blood cells can be decreased in SLE (referred to as leukopenia or leucopenia). Also, low blood-clotting factors called platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') can be caused by lupus. Leukopenia can increase the risk of infection, and ''thrombocytopenia'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Low red blood cell counts (hemolytic\xa0''anemia'') can occur.''Inflammation of muscles (''myositis'') can cause ''muscle pain'' and ''weakness''. This can lead to elevations of muscle enzyme levels in the blood.''Inflammation of blood vessels (''vasculitis'') that supply oxygen to tissues can cause isolated injury to a nerve, the skin, or an internal organ. The blood vessels are composed of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the lungs. ''Vasculitis'' is characterized by inflammation with damage to the walls of various blood vessels. The damage blocks the circulation of blood through the vessels and can cause injury to the tissues that are supplied with oxygen by these vessels.''Inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleuritis) with pain aggravated by deep ''breathing'' (''pleurisy'') and of the heart (pericarditis) can cause sharp ''chest pain''. The chest pain is aggravated by ''coughing'', deep breathing, and certain changes in body position. The heart muscle itself rarely can become inflamed (''carditis''). It has also been shown that young women with SLE have a significantly increased risk of ''heart attacks'' due to ''coronary artery disease''.''Kidney inflammation in SLE (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine, fluid retention, ''high blood pressure'', and even ''kidney failure''. This can lead to further ''fatigue'' and swelling (''edema'') of the legs and feet. With ''kidney failure'', machines are needed to cleanse the blood of accumulated waste products in a process called ''dialysis''.''Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), ''seizures'', and even ''coma''. Lupus of the nervous system (neurologic lupus) can lead to damage to nerves cause numbness, tingling, and weakness of the involved body parts or extremities. Brain involvement is referred to as lupus cerebritis.''Many people with SLE experience ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Often, this occurs simultaneously with an increase in the activity of their disease. The hair loss can be patchy or diffuse and appear to be more like hair thinning.''Some people with SLE have '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon causes the blood vessels of the hands and feet to spasm, especially upon exposure to cold. The blood supply to the fingers and/or toes then becomes compromised, causing blanching, whitish and/or bluish discoloration, and pain and numbness in the exposed fingers and toes.""'Other diseases and conditions that can accompany lupus include ''fibromyalgia'', coronary ''heart disease'', nonbacterial ''valvular heart disease'', ''pancreatitis'', ''esophagus'' disease with ''difficulty swallowing'' (''dysphagia''), ''swollen lymph nodes'' (''lymphadenopathy''), ''liver disease'' (lupoid ''hepatitis''), infections, and a tendency to spontaneous blood clotting and thrombosis.'   fatigue or feeling tired, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, joint pain, muscle aches, hair loss (alopecia), arthritis, ulcers of the mouth and nose, facial rash (""butterfly rash""), unusual sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), chest pain caused by inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lungs (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis), and poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure (Raynaud's phenomenon)."
How do health care professionals diagnose lupus?,"'Since SLE patients can have a wide variety of symptoms and different combinations of organ involvement, no single blood test establishes the diagnosis of systemic lupus. To help doctors improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of SLE, 11 criteria were established by the American Rheumatism Association. These 11 criteria are closely related to the symptoms discussed above. Some people suspected of having SLE may never develop enough criteria for a definite diagnosis. Other people accumulate enough criteria only after months or years of observation. When a person has four or more of these criteria, the diagnosis of SLE is strongly suggested. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of SLE may be made in some settings in people with only a few of these classical criteria, and treatment may sometimes be instituted at this stage. Of these people with minimal criteria, some may later develop other criteria, but many never do.''The following are 11 criteria used for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus:''In addition to the 11 criteria, other tests can be helpful in evaluating people with SLE to determine the severity of organ involvement. These include routine testing of the blood to detect inflammation (for example, the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', or ESR, and the ''C-reactive protein'', or CRP), blood-chemistry testing, direct analysis of internal body fluids, and tissue biopsies. Abnormalities in body fluids (joint or cerebrospinal fluid) and tissue samples (kidney biopsy, ''skin biopsy'', and nerve biopsy) can further support the diagnosis of SLE. The appropriate testing procedures are selected for the patient individually by the doctor.' Malar rash (over the cheeks of the face) Discoid skin rash (patchy redness with hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation that can cause scarring) Photosensitivity (skin rash in reaction to sunlight [ultraviolet light] exposure) Mucous membrane ulcers (spontaneous sores or ulcers of the lining of the mouth, nose, or throat) Arthritis (two or more swollen, tender joints of the extremities) Pleuritis or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining tissue around the heart or lungs, usually associated with chest pain upon breathing or changes of body position) Kidney abnormalities (abnormal amounts of urine protein or clumps of cellular elements called casts detectable with a standard urinalysis)Note: Ultimately, in patients with kidney disease from systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus nephritis), a kidney biopsy may be necessary to both define the cause of the kidney disease as being lupus-related as well as to determine the stage of the kidney disease in order to optimally guide treatments. Kidney biopsies are often performed by fine-needle aspiration of the kidney under radiology guidance, but in certain circumstances, a kidney biopsy can be done during an open abdominal operation. Brain irritation (manifested by seizures [convulsions] and/or psychosis, referred to as ""lupus cerebritis"") Blood-count abnormalities: low white blood count (WBC) or red blood count (RBC), or platelet count on routine complete blood count testing; leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Each of these are detectable with standard complete blood count testing (CBC). Immunologic disorder (abnormal immune tests include anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) or anti-Sm [anti-Smith] antibodies, falsely positive blood test for syphilis, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or positive LE prep test) Antinuclear antibody (positive ANA antibody testing [antinuclear antibodies in the blood])"
What specialties of health care professionals treat lupus?,"'Lupus is treated by internal medicine subspecialists called ''rheumatologists'"". Depending on whether or not specific organs are targeted, other health specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with lupus include dermatologists, nephrologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and neurologists. It's not uncommon that a team of such physicians is coordinated by the treating ""'rheumatologist'' together with the primary care doctor.' "
What is the treatment for lupus? Is there a cure for lupus?,"""There is no permanent cure for SLE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and protect organs by decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity in the body. The precise treatment is decided on an individual basis. Many people with mild symptoms may need no treatment or only intermittent courses of anti-inflammatory medications. Those with more serious illness involving damage to internal organ(s) may require high doses of corticosteroids in combination with other medications that suppress the body's immune system.""'People with SLE need more rest during periods of active disease. Researchers have reported that poor ''sleep'' quality was a significant factor in developing fatigue in people with SLE. These reports emphasize the importance for people and physicians to address ''sleep'' quality and the effect of underlying ''depression'', lack of ''exercise'', and self-care coping strategies on overall health. During these periods, carefully prescribed ''exercise'' is still important to maintain muscle tone and range of motion in the joints.''To protect from sun sensitivity, sunscreens, sun avoidance, and ''sun protection'' clothing are used. Certain types of lupus rash can respond to topical cortisone medications.''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') are helpful in reducing inflammation and pain in muscles, joints, and other tissues. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''). Since the individual response to NSAIDs varies, it is common for a doctor to try different NSAIDs to find the most effective one with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects are stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even ulcer bleeding. NSAIDs are usually taken with food to reduce side effects. Sometimes, medications that prevent ulcers while taking NSAIDs, such as ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''), are given simultaneously.''Corticosteroids are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and restoring function when the disease is active. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful when internal organs are affected. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth, injected directly into the joints and other tissues, or administered intravenously. Unfortunately, corticosteroids have serious side effects when given in high doses over prolonged periods, and the doctor will try to monitor the activity of the disease in order to use the lowest doses that are safe. Side effects of corticosteroids include ''weight gain'', thinning of the bones and skin, infection, ''diabetes'', facial puffiness, ''cataracts'', and death (necrosis) of the tissues in large joints.''Hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) is an antimalarial medication found to be particularly effective for SLE patients with fatigue, skin involvement, and joint disease. Consistently taking Plaquenil can prevent flare-ups of lupus. Side effects are uncommon but include ''diarrhea'', ''upset stomach'', and eye-pigment changes. Eye-pigment changes are rare but require monitoring by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) during treatment with Plaquenil. Researchers have found that Plaquenil significantly decreased the frequency of abnormal ''blood clots'' in people with systemic lupus. Moreover, the effect seemed independent of immune suppression, implying that Plaquenil can directly act to prevent the blood clots. This fascinating study highlights an important reason for people and doctors to consider Plaquenil for long-term use, especially for those SLE people who are at some risk for blood clots in veins and arteries, such as those with phospholipid antibodies (cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and false-positive ''venereal disease'' research laboratory test). This means not only that Plaquenil reduces the chance for re-flares of SLE, but it can also be beneficial in thinning the blood to prevent abnormal excessive blood clotting. Plaquenil is commonly used in combination with other treatments for lupus.''For resistant skin disease, other antimalarial drugs, such as ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or quinacrine, are considered and can be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Alternative medications for skin disease include ''dapsone'' and retinoic acid (Retin-A). Retin-A is often effective for an uncommon wart-like form of lupus skin disease. For more severe skin disease, immunosuppressive medications are considered as described below.''Medications that suppress immunity (immunosuppressive medications) are also called cytotoxic drugs. They are sometimes referred to as chemotherapy because they are also used to treat ''cancer'', generally in much higher doses than those used to treat lupus. Immunosuppressive medications are used for treating people with more severe manifestations of SLE, such as damage to internal organ(s). Examples of immunosuppressive medications include ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), and the disease-modifying drug ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). All immunosuppressive medications can seriously depress blood-cell counts and increase risks of infection and bleeding. Immunosuppressive medications may not be taken during ''pregnancy'' or ''conception'' because of risk to the fetus. Other side effects are specific for each drug. For examples, methotrexate can cause liver toxicity, while cyclosporine can impair kidney function.''In recent years, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''CellCept'') has been used as an effective medication for lupus, particularly when it is associated with kidney disease. CellCept has been helpful in reversing active lupus kidney disease (lupus ''renal disease'') and in maintaining remission after it is established. Its lower side-effect profile has advantage over traditional immune-suppression medications.''In lupus patients with serious brain (lupus cerebritis) or kidney disease (lupus nephritis), plasmapheresis is sometimes used to remove antibodies and other immune substances from the blood to suppress immunity. Plasmapheresis is a process of removing blood and passing the blood through a filtering machine, then returning the blood to the body with its antibodies removed. Rarely, people with SLE can develop seriously low platelet levels, thereby increasing the risk of excessive and spontaneous bleeding. Since the spleen is believed to be the major site of platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen is sometimes performed to improve platelet levels. Other treatments have included plasmapheresis and the use of male hormones.''Plasmapheresis has also been used to remove certain harmful proteins (cryoglobulins) that can lead to vasculitis. End-stage kidney damage from SLE requires dialysis and/or a ''kidney transplant''.''Research is indicating benefits of ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') in treating lupus. Rituximab is an intravenously infused antibody that suppresses a particular white blood cell, the B cell, by decreasing their number in the circulation. B cells have been found to play a central role in lupus activity, and when they are suppressed, the disease tends toward remission. This may particularly helpful for people with kidney disease.''Another new B-cell-suppressing treatment is ''belimumab'' (''Benlysta''). Belimumab blocks the stimulation of the B cells (a B-lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS-specific inhibitor) and is approved for the treatment of adults with active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the efficacy of belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. Belimumab has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.'  "
Is there a lupus diet?,"'While there is no specific lupus ''diet'', scientists have found that low-dose ''diet'' supplementation with ''omega-3'' fish oils could help patients with lupus by decreasing inflammation and disease activity and possibly decreasing heart-disease risk. It is generally recommended that patients with lupus eat a balanced diet that includes plant-based foods and lean sources of protein.''DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) has been helpful in reducing fatigue, improving thinking difficulties, and improving quality of life in people with SLE. Recent research indicates that DHEA diet supplementation has been shown to improve or stabilize signs and symptoms of SLE. DHEA is commonly available in health-food stores, pharmacies, and many groceries.'  "
How can a lupus patient help prevent disease activity (flares)?,"'SLE is undoubtedly a potentially serious illness with involvement of numerous organ systems. However, it is important to recognize that most people with SLE lead full, active, and healthy lives. Periodic increases in disease activity (flares) can usually be managed by varying medications. Since ultraviolet light can precipitate and worsen flares, people with systemic lupus should avoid sun exposure. Sunscreens and clothing covering the extremities can be helpful. Abruptly stopping medications, especially corticosteroids, can also cause flares and should be avoided. People with SLE are at increased risk of infections as SLE-related complications, especially if they are taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, any unexpected fever should be reported to medical professionals and evaluated.''The key to successful management of SLE is regular contact and communication with the doctor, allowing monitoring of symptoms, disease activities, and treatment of side effects.' "
How can systemic lupus erythematosus affect pregnancy or the newborn?,"'Lupus pregnancy deserves special review because it presents unique challenges. ''Pregnant'' women with SLE are considered high-risk ''pregnancies''. These pregnancies require interactive monitoring generally by a skilled rheumatologist together with an obstetrician expert in high-risk pregnancies. Women with SLE who are pregnant require close observation during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. This includes fetal monitoring by the obstetrician during later pregnancy. These women can have an increased risk of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) and can have flares of SLE during pregnancy. The presence of phospholipid antibodies, such as cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, in the blood can identify people at risk for miscarriages. Cardiolipin antibodies are associated with a tendency toward blood clotting. Women with SLE who have cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant may need blood-thinning medications (aspirin with or without ''heparin'') during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected people with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have had a previous blood-clotting event may benefit by continuation of blood-thinning medications throughout and after pregnancy for up to six to 12 weeks, at which time the risk of clotting associated with pregnancy seems to diminish. Plaquenil has now been found to be safe for use to treat SLE during pregnancy. Corticosteroids, such as ''prednisone'', are also safely used to treat certain manifestation of lupus during pregnancy.''Lupus antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus and result in lupus illness in the ''newborn'' (""''neonatal'' lupus""). This includes the development of low red cell counts (hemolytic anemia) and/or white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and skin rash. Problems can also develop in the electrical system of the baby\'s heart (congenital ''heart block''). Occasionally, a ''pacemaker'"" for the baby's heart is needed in this setting. Neonatal lupus and congenital heart block are more common in newborns of mothers with SLE who carry specific antibodies referred to as anti-Ro (or anti-SSA) and anti-La (or anti-SSB). (It is helpful for the newborn baby's doctor to be made aware if the mother is known to carry these antibodies, even prior to delivery. The risk of heart block is 2%; the risk of neonatal lupus is 5%.) Neonatal lupus usually clears after 6 months of age, as the mother's antibodies are slowly metabolized by the baby."" "
What is the prognosis of lupus? What does the future hold for people with systemic lupus?,"'Overall, the outlook for people living with systemic lupus is improving each decade with the development of more accurate monitoring tests and treatments.''The role of the immune system in causing diseases is becoming better understood through research. This knowledge will be applied to design safer and more effective treatment methods. For example, completely revising the immune system of people with extremely aggressive treatments that virtually temporarily wipe out the immune system is being evaluated. Current studies involve immune eradication with or without replacement of cells that can reestablish the immune system (stem-cell transplantation).''It should be noted that people with SLE are at a somewhat increased risk for developing ''cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is most dramatic for blood ''cancers'', such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma'', but is also increased for ''breast cancer''. This risk probably relates, in part, to the altered immune system that is characteristic of SLE.''Women with SLE appear to be at increased risk for ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'') according to recent reports. Women with SLE should be evaluated and counseled to minimize risk factors for ''heart disease'', such as elevated blood ''cholesterol'', quitting ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''obesity''.''Landmark research has shown clearly that ''oral contraceptives'' do not increase the rate of flares of systemic lupus erythematosus. This important finding is opposite to what has been thought for years. Now we can reassure women with lupus that if they take birth-control pills, they are not increasing their risk for lupus flares. ''Note'': Women who are at increased risk of blood clotting, such as women with lupus who have phospholipid antibodies (including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant), should avoid birth-control pills or any estrogen medications.''Individuals living with SLE can improve their long-term prognosis by learning about the many aspects of the illness as well as closely monitoring their own health with their doctors.'

What is Still's disease?,"""Still's disease, a disorder featuring inflammation, is characterized by high spiking ""'fevers'"", salmon-colored rash that comes and goes, and arthritis. Still's disease is also referred to as systemic-onset ""'juvenile idiopathic arthritis'"". Still's disease was first described in children, but it is now known to occur, much less commonly, in adults (in whom it is referred to as adult-onset Still's disease or AOSD). Still's disease is named after the English physician Sir George F. Still (1861-1941)."" "
What causes Still's disease?,"""There have been a number of schools of thought regarding the cause (or causes) of Still's disease. One concept is that Still's disease is due to infection with a microbe. Another idea is that Still's disease is an autoimmune disorder. In fact, the precise cause of Still's disease is not yet known."" "
What are risk factors for Still's disease?,"""There are no specific known risk factors for the development of Still's disease."" "
How does Still's disease relate to juvenile idiopathic arthritis?,"""Still's disease is one type of ""'juvenile idiopathic arthritis'' (''JIA'') and is also known as systemic-onset ''JIA''. It is referred to as ""juvenile"" because it typically affects children under 16 years of age. By systemic, it is meant that along with joint inflammation it typically begins with symptoms and signs of systemic (body-wide) illness, such as high ''fevers'', gland swelling, and internal organ involvement. By idiopathic, it is meant that the disease has no known cause.''Systemic-onset JIA was formerly known as ''systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'' (''JRA'') and is the same disease. Several years ago, the naming system for all types of ''JRA'' changed, and JRA is now called juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA.' "
What are Still's disease symptoms and signs?,"""Still's disease usually begins with systemic (body-wide) symptoms.""""Other Still's disease symptoms.are:""   Extreme fatigue can accompany waves of high fevers that rise daily to 102 F (39 C) or even higher and rapidly return to normal levels or below. Fever spikes often occur at approximately the same time every day. A faint salmon-colored skin rash characteristically comes and goes and does not itch. Poor appetite, nausea, and weight loss are common There is also commonly swelling of the lymph glands, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and sore throat. Some patients develop inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) and lungs (pleuritis), with occasional fluid accumulation around the heart (pericardial effusion) and lungs (pleural effusion). Arthritis, with joint swelling, often occurs after rash and fevers have been present for some time. Although arthritis may initially be overlooked because of the impressive nature of the systemic symptoms, everyone with Still's disease eventually develops joint pain and swollen joints. This usually involves many joints (polyarticular arthritis). Any joint can be affected, although there are preferential patterns of joint involvement in Still's disease."
How do health care professionals diagnose Still's disease?,"""Still's disease is diagnosed purely on the basis of the typical clinical features of the illness.""""Many patients with Still's disease develop markedly elevated white blood cell counts, as if they have a serious infection, but no infection is found."" These features include high intermittent fever, joint inflammation and pain, muscle pain, faint salmon-colored skin rash, swelling of the lymph glands or enlargement of the spleen and liver, and inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) or lungs (pleuritis). Persistent arthritis (arthritis lasting at least six weeks) is required to make a firm diagnosis of Still's disease. Other diseases (especially infections, cancers, and other types of arthritis) must be excluded. Low red blood counts (anemia) and elevated blood tests that indicate inflammation (such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, C-reactive protein, and ferritin) are common. However, the classic blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid factor) and systemic lupus erythematosus (antinuclear antibodies) are usually negative."
What is the frequency of Still's disease and its features?,"""Still's disease accounts for 10%-20% of all cases of JIA. It affects about 25,000-50,000 children in the United States. It is rare in adults, a majority of whom are 20-35 years of age at the onset of symptoms.""""Of all patients with Still's disease, 100% have high intermittent fever, and 100% have joint inflammation and pain, muscle pain with fevers, and develop persistent chronic arthritis. Approximately 95% of Still's disease patients have the faint salmon-colored skin rash, 85% have swelling of the lymph glands or enlargement of the spleen and liver, 85% have a marked increase in the white blood cell count, 60% have inflammation of the lungs (pleuritis) or around the heart (pericarditis), 40% have severe ""'anemia'', and 20% have ''abdominal pain''.' "
What is the treatment for Still's disease?,"""Still's disease can cause serious damage to the joints, particularly the wrists. It can also impair the function of the heart and lungs. Treatment of Still's disease is directed toward the individual areas of inflammation. Many symptoms are often controlled with anti-inflammatory ""'drugs'' such as ''aspirin'' or other nonsteroidal drugs (''NSAIDs'""). It has been reported that some patients with Still's disease can frequently have elevations of ""'liver function'' blood tests as a side effect of aspirin and sometimes other anti-inflammatory medications. Cortisone medications (steroids) such as ''prednisone'' are used to treat more severe features of illness.''For patients with persistent illness, medications that affect the inflammatory aspects of the immune system are used. Medications now being used are analogous to the classic ""second-line"" therapies used for patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. These include ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil), ''penicillamine'' (''Cuprimine'', ''Depen''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), and ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan'').'""Recently, because Still's disease has been found to involve a specific chemical messenger of inflammation known as interleukin 1 (IL-1), the injectable biologic medication ""'anakinra'' (''Kineret'""), which blocks IL-1, has been found to be a very effective treatment for Still's disease. Still's disease also involves interleukin 6 (IL-6). ""'Tocilizumab'' (''Actemra''), an intravenous treatment which blocks IL-6, is approved to treat systemic JIA in children.'  "
Is it possible to prevent Still's disease?,"'There is no ''prevention'"" for Still's disease."" "
What types of specialists treat Still's disease?,"""Still's disease is treated by primary care physicians, including pediatricians, internists, general practice, and family practice physicians."" Typically, these primary care doctors work with either pediatric or adult rheumatologists in caring for these patients. Depending on organs affected, other specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with Still's disease includecardiologists,pulmonologists,orthopedic surgeons,physical therapists, andoccupational therapists. cardiologists, pulmonologists, orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists."
What is the prognosis of Still's disease?,"'The fever and other systemic features tend to run their course within several months. The arthritis can be a long-term problem. It usually stays on after the systemic features have gone.'   The arthritis can then become chronic and persist into adulthood. Persisting arthritis of the wrists, with eventual fusion, is common, especially if not treated aggressively. Newer biologic treatments are likely to be beneficial in stopping the progressive joint damage."
What Still's disease research is being done?,"""A wide variety of research is ongoing related to Still's disease. While intravenous immunoglobulin therapy has been used in adult-onset Still's disease, more studies are needed to confirm these results."" Newer IL-1 blockers may prove to be even more effective in treating Still's disease. Also, TNF-inhibitors (etanercept [Enbrel] and infliximab [Remicade]) have been used successfully in people who have failed other treatments (much as they are now used in rheumatoid arthritis). The intravenous infusions of infliximab helped decrease the Still's disease signs and symptoms, including fever, arthritis, muscle pains, enlarged spleen, and rash in some studies."
What is a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"""A joint aspiration is a procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain synovial fluid from a patient's joint. Joint aspiration is typically performed by a doctor or ancillary health care provider as an office procedure or at the bedside of hospitalized patients. Joint aspiration is sometimes called joint drainage and is medically referred to as arthrocentesis."" "
"How do patients prepare for a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and does it cause pain?","""Patients do not need any special preparation before a joint aspiration. The aspiration is easily performed in a doctor's office as an outpatient procedure. ""'Pain'"" is minimized by topical or local anesthetics applied onto the patient's skin or just beneath the skin. Usually, there is a momentary, slight amount of ""'pain'"" as the needle is inserted into the patient's joint space. Withdrawal of the fluid into the syringe does not typically cause pain. Injection of medication into the joint does not typically cause pain. There is very slight pain sometimes as the needle is withdrawn from the joint. Any pain is reduced by topical or local anesthetics that block pain sensation."" "
"What is the purpose of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and when is it performed?","'Joint aspiration can be both used for diagnosis and medical treatment of ''arthritis'"" of a joint. Joint aspiration is used to obtain fluid from the patient's joint for examination in the laboratory. Analysis of joint fluid can help the physician to define causes of ""'joint swelling'' (joint effusion) or arthritis, such as infection, ''gout'' arthritis, and ''rheumatoid disease''. Fluid from the joint can be tested for white cell count, crystals, protein, glucose, as well as cultured to detect infection. Each of these laboratory parameters can be helpful in defining the cause of a particular form of arthritis, particularly in distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory forms of arthritis. The result can be key to identifying various potential ''rheumatology'' diseases and musculoskeletal conditions.''Joint aspiration can also be a helpful treatment in relieving joint swelling and pain. Removal of synovial fluid from the joint that is inflamed can also remove the white blood cells within that are sources of enzymes that can be destructive to the joint. This treatment can more rapidly restore the health of the joint. Bursa aspiration procedure and indications for ''bursitis'' are analogous to joint aspiration for arthritis, except the bursa is the target instead of the joint (intra-articular). The result and analysis of the fluid (aspirate) is similarly evaluated for various diseases and conditions in the laboratory.' "
What is a joint injection?,"'A ''joint injection'' is a procedure whereby a medicine is injected into the joint space with a needle and syringe. Occasionally, cortisone (an anti-inflammatory medication) or ''hyaluronic acid'' derivatives (a synthetic joint lubricant, approved for pain relief of the knee in ''degenerative arthritis'') are injected into the joint during the joint aspiration. ''Cortisone injection'' can rapidly relieve ''joint inflammation'' and further reduce symptoms. Simultaneous joint aspiration followed by joint injection can often be done by changing the aspiration syringe with the syringe for the injection (such as for steroid injection). In this way, the joint injection does not need to be done as a separate procedure. ' "
How is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) performed?,"'The skin over the joint is cleaned by the health care professional using a liquid, typically an ''iodine'' solution (Betadine). Local anesthetic is used in the area of the joint; either by injection, a topical liquid coolant, or both. A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint (joint injection) and joint fluid is drawn back under suction (aspirated) into the syringe. For certain diseases and medical conditions, the health care professional will also inject medicine into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed and a Band-Aid or dressing is applied over the entry point.' "
Who performs a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspirations can be performed under medical guidelines by qualified doctors, including general physicians, internists, orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', interventional radiologists, emergency room physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.' "
Who should not undergo joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There are few health contraindications to a joint aspiration. People who are taking blood-thinning medicines (''anticoagulants'' such as ''warfarin'' [''Coumadin'']) for underlying health reasons can have bleeding into the joint. The risk of this is extremely low, unless the level of blood thinner is too high (making the blood very thin), in which case the procedure may need to be temporarily delayed. The risk of bleeding into the joint is minimized when the physician uses the thinnest needle possible and applies ''cold'' packs after the procedure. If the skin over a joint is infected, the joint should not be aspirated, in order to prevent the infection from spreading into the joint.' "
What are complications of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Medical complications of joint aspiration are uncommon. Possible complications of the aspiration procedure include a reaction to the local anesthetic, local ''bruising'' or, minor bleeding into the joint. If cortisone is used, there may be loss of pigment in the skin (a light-colored spot may develop). A rare but serious complication of the procedure is infection of the joint (''septic arthritis'').''With ''corticosteroid'' injections, additional uncommon complications include inflammation in the joint as a result of the medication crystallizing, shrinkage (atrophy) or loss of pigment of skin at the injection site, increased blood ''sugar'' (worsening of ''diabetes mellitus''), and aggravation of preexisting infection elsewhere in the body. If multiple injections with ''corticosteroids'' are given too frequently, it is possible to develop systemic side effects (side effects throughout the body), such as ''weight gain'', puffy face and trunk, and ''easy bruising''. Injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives may cause local inflammation and swelling of the joint due to a reaction to the medication. Hyaluronic acid injections into the ''knee joint'' for pain relief are generally given no more frequently than every six months.'  "
What is the recovery time for joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There is no recovery time required after joint aspiration. Doctors typically will suggest avoiding stressful activity with the joint for at least 24 hours, especially if medication (such as steroid injection) has been injected by joint injection. If pain increases after the procedure while at home, the doctor should be notified. ' "
What happens in joint replacement surgery?,"'Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. In knee or ''hip replacement'' surgery, the artificial joint is made out of metal and ''plastic'"".  In the case of joint replacement in the hand, the new joint is most commonly composed of silicone rubber or the patient's own tissues such as a portion oftendon.""'Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is very common. Each year, orthopedic surgeons perform thousands of joint replacement surgeries in the U.S.  (Most of these procedures are performed on the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.) Joint replacement surgery in the hand is typically used in treating severe ''arthritis'' that involves the small joints of the hand.''The hips and knees receive continuous ''stress'' from ''walking'',  ''running'', sporting activity, or injury and are more commonly affected by the wearing of cartilage (''degenerative arthritis'') than the  hand joints.  However, the joints of the hand do experience ''stress'' in everyday use, and because the hand joints are smaller, these stresses are concentrated over a smaller surface area. The high ratio of stress to surface area can cause the smooth joint cartilage to wear over the years.  As the cartilage degenerates, the underlying bone becomes exposed.  When the deteriorated joint moves, bone rubs upon bone causing ''pain'', swelling, limiting motion, and frequently causing a grinding or popping sensation.  Furthermore, forms of arthritis that are caused by inflammation of the tissues lining the joint frequently affect the small joints of the hands and wrists to cause joint destruction.  Examples include ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and  ''psoriatic arthritis''.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of arthritis of the hand and 
wrist?","'The most common symptoms of arthritis of the hands include ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and swelling over the joints. The pain is usually worsened when the joint is moved.  Moreover, motion of the joint is frequently limited due to pain and joint contractures.  Symptoms can lead to difficulty with daily living activities including tying shoes, buttoning buttons, opening jars, or turning a key in a lock.''Physical signs of arthritis of the hand include changes in the appearance of the joints.  The joints most commonly affected by degenerative arthritis are those at the ends of the fingers.  Swelling and ''bumps'', or nodes, can occur at the small joints at the area of the base of the nail.  These bumps are called Heberden nodes and can become extremely painful.  The joint at the base of the thumb can also become swollen with ''bone spurs'' and cause pain and deformity.  The joint destruction also leads to severe pain when pinching the fingers together and gripping forcefully.  Joint motion limitation can also decrease the ability to grip.''Wrist arthritis can cause pain with motion of the wrist or grasping and lifting.  Wrist range of motion is frequently limited by the arthritis.  Patients typically experience relief when the wrist is stabilized by a splint.''Rheumatoid arthritis'' frequently causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the wrists, as well as the small joints in the middle and at the base of the fingers. This disease frequently causes hand deformities.  Tissue lumps called rheumatoid nodules can form over the joints of the hand and wrist.  The joints of the fingers and thumb can become deformed and contracted by the destruction of the supporting ligaments, so that grasping and pinching movements are not possible.' "
How are patients with hand joint abnormalities evaluated?,"'The diagnosis of hand joint problems typically involves evaluating symptoms, physical examination, and the x-ray appearance of the joints.  Blood testing is sometimes also helpful in the assessment process.  Joint replacement surgery becomes a treatment option when significant joint destruction and/or deformity are present.' "
What are the different surgical options?,"'Surgical options include'""The optimal surgical treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist varies from patient to patient and is based on many factors.  These factors include the patient's age, hand dominance, employment, level of pain, functional goals, and underlying disease."" cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, including removal of bone 
spurs, fusion of the joint, and joint replacement surgery."
When is surgical cleaning of the joint the best alternative?,"'Surgical cleaning of the joint, or salvage procedure, is usually performed in cases of early ""wear and tear"" arthritis where there are painful bone spurs or, in cases of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', where there is a large amount of inflamed tissue.  Removal of bone spurs is especially helpful when the arthritis involves the joints at the ends of the fingers (distal interphalangeal or DIP joints).' "
"What is a joint fusion? When is it the best surgical 
option?","'Fusion of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically ""fusing"" the bone ends so that the two bones effectively become one solid bone.  This procedure terminates all motion at that joint and thus eliminates the pain. The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced arthritis.''Joint fusion is usually the best surgical option in patients who are younger and very active. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels.  This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.' "
When is joint replacement surgery the best surgical option?,"'Joint replacement surgery in the hand is an excellent option for treating arthritis of the hand in older, low-activity patients and for those with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Joint replacement surgery can provide pain relief, increase finger range of motion, and improve hand function.' "
"How do the surgical options vary with the different joints of 
the hands and wrists?","'Hand joint replacement surgery options differ according to the specific joint(s) involved.''1. ''DIP joint (joint closest to the fingertip)'': This joint is not a good candidate for joint replacement.  The bones are very small and do not hold the implant very well. The best treatment option for advanced arthritis at this joint is fusion.  Hand function is only minimally compromised by lack of motion at this joint after a fusion procedure, while pain is relieved.''2. ''PIP joint (second joint from the fingertip)'': Joint replacement is commonly performed in the PIP joint.  Hand function, especially power grasp, can be hindered by fusion of this joint.  The small and ring fingers are the best candidates for joint replacement as they are the most important for power grasp.  The index finger is not a good candidate for a PIP joint replacement, as it must withstand sideways forces which accompany movements such as key turning and fine manipulation of objects.  These forces cause excess stress on the joint implant and can lead to early implant breakage.''There have been numerous false (prosthetic) joints designed for PIP joint replacement, but only one has stood the test of time.  The only nonexperimental PIP joint replacement is the silicone interpositional arthroplasty.  These joints are made of silicone rubber and have a flexible hinge in the middle and stems at the ends which insert into the shaft of the bone, providing stability.  The most frequently used silicone joint implants are termed the Swanson implant and the Sutter implant.''The best results with PIP joint replacement are in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in older, lower-activity patients.''3. ''MCP joint (third joint from the fingertip)'': ''Osteoarthritis'' rarely affects the MCP joints.  The most common need for joint replacement in this joint is destruction from rheumatoid arthritis.  Silicone joint replacement of the MCP joint has been used since the 1960s and has produced excellent long-term results.''4. ''Thumb basal joint (where the thumb meets the wrist)'': This joint is exposed to very high stresses with normal activities.  Forces felt at the tip of the thumb are multiplied 12 times in their effect to the thumb base, thus predisposing this joint to wear.  Arthritis of this joint is very common, especially in women, and frequently requires joint replacement.  Attempts at silicone replacement of this joint have not been as successful as hoped due to implant failure and bone destruction.  Thus, the most common joint replacement procedure for the thumb base is done with natural material.  The procedure is termed the ligament reconstruction-tendon interposition procedure (LRTI).  This procedure uses the patient\'s own tendon to stabilize the thumb and resurface the joint.  LRTI provides stability and pain relief. Long-term results have been excellent.  This has also been called the tendon roll or ""anchovy"" procedure because the tendon used is curled to form the new joint cushion.''5. ''Wrist joint'': Most patients with wrist arthritis are best treated with surgical joint cleaning or fusion and not joint replacement.  Most wrist-joint prostheses on the market are currently investigational and for use in extremely low activity patients with ''osteoarthritis'' or rheumatoid arthritis. ''Summary''''Arthritis of the hand and wrist is a very common and complex problem with many nonsurgical and surgical treatment options.  Deciding which alternative is best can require the skills of the primary doctor, the arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), and/or an orthopedic surgeon.' "
Joint Replacement Surgery of the Hand At A Glance," Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. This procedure is typically employed in treating severe arthritis involving certain joints. Surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand include cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, fusion, and replacement surgery."
What is arthroscopy?,"'Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure by which the internal structure of a joint is examined for diagnosis and/or treatment using a tube-like viewing instrument called an arthroscope. Arthroscopy was popularized in the 1960s with the advent of fiberoptic technologies and is now commonplace throughout the world. Typically, it is performed by orthopedic surgeons in an outpatient setting. When performed in the outpatient setting, patients can usually return home on the same day the procedure is completed.''The technique of arthroscopy involves inserting the arthroscope, a small tube that contains optical fibers and lenses, through tiny incisions in the skin into the joint to be examined. The arthroscope is connected to a video camera and the interior of the joint is seen on a television monitor. The size of the arthroscope varies with the size of the joint being examined. For example, the knee is examined with an arthroscope that is approximately 5 millimeters in diameter. There are arthroscopes as small as 0.5 millimeters in diameter to examine small joints such as the wrist.''If procedures are performed in addition to examining the joint with the arthroscope, this is called arthroscopic surgery. There are a number of procedures that are done in this fashion. If a procedure can be done arthroscopically instead of by traditional surgical techniques, it usually causes less tissue ''trauma'', may result in less ''pain'', and may promote a quicker recovery.' "
For what diseases or conditions is arthroscopy considered?,"'Arthroscopy can be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of many noninflammatory, inflammatory, and infectious types of ''arthritis'' as well as various injuries within the joint.''Noninflammatory ''degenerative arthritis'', or ''osteoarthritis'', can be seen using the arthroscope as frayed and irregular cartilage. A new procedure for the treatment of younger patients with an isolated injury to the cartilage covering the bone ends within a joint uses a ""paste"" of the patient\'s own cartilage cells. The cells are harvested and grown in the laboratory and are then reimplanted at a later date in the knee with the use of an arthroscope.''In inflammatory arthritis, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', some patients with isolated chronic ''joint swelling'' can sometimes benefit by arthroscopic removal of the inflamed joint tissue (synovectomy). The tissue lining the joint (synovium) can be biopsied and examined under a microscope to determine the cause of the inflammation and discover infections, such as ''tuberculosis''. Arthroscopy can provide more information in situations which cannot be diagnosed by simply aspirating (withdrawing fluid with a needle) and analyzing the joint fluid.''Common ''knee joint'' injuries for which arthroscopy is considered include cartilage tears (''meniscus'' tears), ligament ''strains'' and tears, and cartilage deterioration underneath the kneecap (''patella''). Arthroscopy is commonly used in the evaluation of knees and shoulders but can also be used to examine and treat conditions of the hips, wrist, ankles, ''feet'', spine, and elbows.''Finally, loose tissues, such as chips of bone or cartilage, or foreign objects, such as plant thorns or needles, which become lodged within the joint can be removed with arthroscopy.' "
What is done in preparation for arthroscopy?,"""Arthroscopy is essentially a procedure during which no blood loss is expected and generally has few complications. The underlying health of the patient is considered when determining who is a candidate for arthroscopy. Most importantly, the patient should be able tolerate the anesthetic that is used during the procedure. A person's ""'heart'', kidney, ''liver'', and lung function should be adequate. If there are existing problems such as ''heart failure'' or ''emphysema'', these should be optimized as possible prior to surgery. Patients who are on ''anticoagulants'' (blood thinners) should have these medications carefully adjusted prior to surgery. Other medical problems should also be controlled prior to surgery, such as ''diabetes'' and ''high blood pressure''.'""Preoperative evaluation of a patient's health will generally include a physical examination, blood tests, and a ""'urinalysis''. Patients who have a history of heart or lung problems and generally anyone over the age of 50 will usually be asked to obtain an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') and a ''chest X-ray''. Any signs of ongoing infection in the body usually postpones arthroscopy, unless it is being done for possible infection of the joint in question.' "
How is arthroscopy performed?,"'Arthroscopy is most often performed as an outpatient procedure. The patient will check into the facility where the procedure is being performed and an intravenous line (IV) established in order to administer fluids and medication for anesthesia. The type of anesthesia used varies depending on the joint being examined and the medical health of the patient. Arthroscopy can be performed under a general anesthetic, a spinal or epidural anesthetic, a regional block (where only the extremity being examined is numbed), or even a local anesthetic. If a general anesthetic is not used, the patient is often sedated. After adequate anesthesia is achieved, the procedure can begin. An incision is made on the side of the joint to be examined and the arthroscope is inserted into the incision. Other instruments are sometimes placed in another incision to help maneuver certain structures into the view of the arthroscope. In arthroscopic surgery, additional instruments for surgical repairs are inserted into the joint through additional small incisions in the joint. These instruments can be used to cut, remove, and suture (sew) damaged tissues. Once the procedure is completed, the arthroscope in removed and the incisions are sutured closed. A sterile dressing is placed over the incision and a brace or ACE wrap may be placed around the joint.' "
How long is the recovery time after arthroscopy?,"'Immediately after arthroscopic surgery, patients may be sleepy, especially if a general anesthetic or sedation has been used. Medications are administered to control ''pain'' if needed. If a local anesthetic has been used, there may be no pain at all immediately after the procedure. If a spinal or regional anesthetic has been used, there can be numbness and ''weakness'' of the extremity that gradually resolves before the patient is sent home.''The surgical incisions from arthroscopy are small. They usually consist of one or more 5 mm (1/4 inch) incisions on either side of the joint, which are bandaged after surgery. The bandage may absorb some of the tissue drainage from these ''wound'"" sites. The bandage should only be removed under the advice of the treating surgeon or nurse. It should otherwise be kept as dry as possible during the first few days after surgery. Patients should notify their physician's office immediately if they develop unusual ""'joint pain'', swelling, redness or warmth, or if they injure the involved joint.''For several days after arthroscopy, patients will generally be asked to rest and elevate the joint while applying ice packs to minimize pain and swelling. After surgery, an ''exercise'' program is gradually started that strengthens the muscles surrounding the joint and prevents scarring (contracture) of surrounding soft tissues. The goal is to recover stability, range of motion, and strength of the joint rapidly and safely, while preventing the build-up of ''scar tissue''. This program is an essential part of the recovery process for an optimal outcome of this procedure.''Over the years, higher quality fiberoptic equipment has allowed the development of miniature arthroscopes. This has allowed the examination of smaller joints with arthroscopy. Arthroscopy has become an integral tool for orthopedic surgery and its role will continue to expand as further improvement in arthroscopes and arthroscopic instruments continues.'  "
What are potential complications of arthroscopy?,"'Potential complications of arthroscopy are rare and include bleeding into the joint and infection of the joint, as well as side effects from anesthesia.' "
What specialties of doctors perform arthroscopy?,'Arthroscopy is performed by orthopedic surgeons.' 
Introduction to hemodialysis,"'Hemodialysis'' is the most common method used to treat advanced and permanent ''kidney failure''. Since the 1960s, when hemodialysis first became a practical treatment for ''kidney failure'"", we've learned much about how to make hemodialysis treatments more effective and minimize side effects. In recent years, more compact and simpler ""'dialysis'' machines have made home dialysis increasingly attractive. However, even with better procedures and equipment, hemodialysis is still a complicated and inconvenient therapy that requires a coordinated effort from your whole health care team, including your nephrologist, dialysis nurse, dialysis technician, dietitian, and social worker. The most important members of your health care team are you and your family. By learning about your treatment, you can work with your health care team to give yourself the best possible results, and you can lead a full, active life. ' "
When Your Kidneys Fail,"'Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, ''minerals'', and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body, your ''blood pressure'' may rise, and your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough ''red blood cells''. When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys. ' "
How Hemodialysis Works,"'In hemodialysis, your blood is allowed to flow, a few ounces at a time, through a special filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to your body. Removing the harmful wastes and extra salt and fluids helps control your blood pressure and keep the proper balance of chemicals like potassium and sodium in your body. ''One of the biggest adjustments you must make when you start hemodialysis treatments is following a strict schedule. Most patients go to a clinic-a dialysis center-three times a week for 3 to 5 or more hours each visit. For example, you may be on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule or a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule. You may be asked to choose a morning, afternoon, or evening shift, depending on availability and capacity at the dialysis unit. Your dialysis center will explain your options for scheduling regular treatments. ''Researchers are exploring whether shorter daily sessions, or longer sessions performed overnight while the patient sleeps, are more effective in removing wastes. Newer dialysis machines make these alternatives more practical with home dialysis. However, the federal government has not yet established a policy to pay for more than three hemodialysis sessions a week. ''Several centers around the country teach people how to perform their own hemodialysis treatments at home. A family member or friend who will be your helper must also take the training, which usually takes at least 4 to 6 weeks. Home dialysis gives you more flexibility in your dialysis schedule. With home hemodialysis, the time for each session and the number of sessions per week may vary, but you must maintain a regular schedule by giving yourself dialysis treatments as often as you would receive them in a dialysis unit. ' "
Adjusting to Changes,"'Even in the best situations, adjusting to the effects of kidney failure and the time you spend on dialysis can be difficult. Aside from the ""lost time,"" you may have less energy. You may need to make changes in your work or home life, giving up some activities and responsibilities. Keeping the same schedule you kept when your kidneys were working can be very difficult now that your kidneys have failed. Accepting this new reality can be very hard on you and your family. A counselor or social worker can answer your questions and help you cope. ''Many patients feel ''depressed'' when starting dialysis, or after several months of treatment. If you feel depressed, you should talk with your social worker, nurse, or doctor because this is a common problem that can often be treated effectively. ' "
Getting Your Vascular Access Ready,"'One important step before starting hemodialysis is preparing a vascular access, a site on your body from which your blood is removed and returned. A vascular access should be prepared weeks or months before you start dialysis. It will allow easier and more efficient removal and replacement of your blood with fewer complications. For more information about the different kinds of vascular accesses and how to care for them, see the National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) fact sheet ''Vascular Access for Hemodialysis''. ' "
Equipment and Procedures,"""When you first visit a hemodialysis center, it may seem like a complicated mix of machines and people. But once you learn how the procedure works and become familiar with the equipment, you'll be more comfortable. ""'The ''dialysis machine'' is about the size of a dishwasher. This machine has three main jobs: ''The dialyzer is a large canister containing thousands of small fibers through which your blood is passed. Dialysis solution, the cleansing fluid, is pumped around these fibers. The fibers allow wastes and extra fluids to pass from your blood into the solution, which carries them away. The dialyzer is sometimes called an artificial kidney. ''Dialysis solution, also known as dialysate, is the fluid in the dialyzer that helps remove wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It contains chemicals that make it act like a sponge. Your doctor will give you a specific dialysis solution for your treatments. This formula can be adjusted based on how well you handle the treatments and on your blood tests. '""Many people find the needle sticks to be one of the hardest parts of hemodialysis treatments. Most people, however, report getting used to them after a few sessions. If you find the needle insertion painful, an anesthetic cream or spray can be applied to the skin. The cream or spray will numb your skin briefly so you won't feel the needle. ""'Most dialysis centers use two needles-one to carry blood to the dialyzer and one to return the cleaned blood to your body. Some specialized needles are designed with two openings for two-way flow of blood, but these needles are less efficient and require longer sessions. Needles for high-flux or high-efficiency dialysis need to be a little larger than those used with regular dialyzers. ''Some people prefer to insert their own needles. You\'ll need training on inserting needles properly to prevent infection and protect your vascular access. You may also learn a ""ladder"" strategy for needle placement in which you ""climb"" up the entire length of the access session by session so that you don\'t weaken an area with a grouping of needle sticks. A different approach is the ""buttonhole"" strategy in which you use a limited number of sites but insert the needle back into the same hole made by the previous needle stick. Whether you insert your own needles or not, you should know these techniques to better care for your access. ' pump blood and watch flow for safety clean wastes from blood watch your blood pressure and the rate of fluid removal from your body Reuse. Your dialysis center may use the same dialyzer more than once for your treatments. Reuse is considered safe as long as the dialyzer is cleaned before each use. The dialyzer is tested each time to make sure it's still working, and it should never be used for anyone but you. Before each session, you should be sure that the dialyzer is labeled with your name and check to see that it has been cleaned, disinfected, and tested. "
Tests to See How Well Your Dialysis Is Working,"'About once a month, your dialysis care team will test your blood by using one of two formulas-URR or Kt/V-to see whether your treatments are removing enough wastes. Both tests look at one specific waste product, called blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as an indicator for the overall level of waste products in your system. For more information about these measurements, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Hemodialysis Dose and Adequacy''. ' "
Conditions Related to Kidney Failure and Their Treatments,"'Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with ''anemia'' and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme ''tiredness'', bone problems, joint problems, ''itching'', and ""restless legs."" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping. ''Anemia'"" is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to ""'heart'' problems. ''Anemia is common in people with ''kidney disease'' because the kidneys produce the hormone ''erythropoietin'"", or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis. ""'For more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet''Anemia in Kidney Disease and Dialysis''. ''The term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. ''Renal osteodystrophy'', or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'' are at greater risk for this disease. ''Many people treated with hemodialysis complain of ''itchy'' skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. ''Itching'"" is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood. ""'The problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. ''A cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few ''antihistamines'' (''Benadryl'', Atarax, ''Vistaril'') have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of ''dry skin'' is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help. ''Patients on dialysis often have ''insomnia'', and some people have a specific problem called the ''sleep apnea'' syndrome, which is often signaled by ''snoring'' and breaks in ''snoring''. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in ''breathing'' during ''sleep''. Over time, these ''sleep'' disturbances can lead to ""day-night reversal"" (''insomnia'' at night, sleepiness during the day), ''headache'', ''depression'', and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have ''sleep apnea'', whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP'').''Many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or ""restless"" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances. ''Moderate ''exercise'' during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with ''restless leg syndrome'' should reduce or avoid ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A class of ''drugs'' called ''benzodiazepines'', often used to treat ''insomnia'' or ''anxiety'', may help as well. These prescription drugs include ''Klonopin'', ''Librium'', ''Valium'', and ''Halcion''. A newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (''Sinemet''), a drug used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease. ''Sleep disorders'"" may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. Don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker. ""'Dialysis-related ''amyloidosis'' (DRA) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. DRA develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and fluid in the joints, as is the case with ''arthritis''. Working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. ' "
How Diet Can Help,"""Eating the right foods can help improve your dialysis and your health. Your clinic has a dietitian to help you plan meals. Follow the dietitian's advice closely to get the most from your hemodialysis treatments. Here are a few general guidelines. ""'You can also ask your dietitian for ''recipes'' and titles of cookbooks for patients with kidney disease. Following the restrictions of a diet for kidney disease might be hard at first, but with a little creativity, you can make tasty and satisfying meals. For more information, see the NIDDK booklet''Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis''. '  Fluids. Your dietitian will help you determine how much fluid to drink each day. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure, make your heart work harder, and increase the stress of dialysis treatments. Remember that many foods-such as soup, ice cream, and fruits-contain plenty of water. Ask your dietitian for tips on controlling your thirst.  Potassium. The mineral potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Potassium affects how steadily your heart beats, so eating foods with too much of it can be very dangerous to your heart. To control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like oranges, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and dried fruits. You can remove some of the potassium from potatoes and other vegetables by peeling and soaking them in a large container of water for several hours, then cooking them in fresh water. Phosphorus. The mineral phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Control of phosphorus may be even more important than calcium itself in preventing bone disease and related complications. Foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus and should be avoided. You'll probably need to take a phosphate binder with your food to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. Salt (sodium chloride). Most canned foods and frozen dinners contain high amounts of sodium. Too much of it makes you thirsty, and when you drink more fluid, your heart has to work harder to pump the fluid through your body. Over time, this can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products labeled ""low sodium."" Protein. Before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet to preserve kidney function. But now you have different nutritional priorities. Most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. Protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue, but protein breaks down into urea (blood urea nitrogen, or BUN) in your body. Some sources of protein, called high-quality proteins, produce less waste than others. High-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Getting most of your protein from these sources can reduce the amount of urea in your blood. Calories. Calories provide your body with energy. Some people on dialysis need to gain weight. You may need to find ways to add calories to your diet. Vegetable oils-like olive, canola, and safflower oils-are good sources of calories and do not contribute to problems controlling your cholesterol. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly also provide calories and energy. If you have diabetes, however, be very careful about eating sweets. A dietitian's guidance is especially important for people with diabetes. Supplements. Vitamins and minerals may be missing from your diet because you have to avoid so many foods. Dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement designed specifically for people with kidney failure. Take your prescribed supplement after treatment on the days you have hemodialysis. Never take vitamins that you can buy off the store shelf, since they may contain vitamins or minerals that are harmful to you. "
Financial Issues,"'Treatment for kidney failure is expensive, but Federal health insurance plans pay much of the cost, usually up to 80 percent. Often, private insurance or State programs pay the rest. Your social worker can help you locate resources for financial assistance. For more information, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Financial Help for Treatment of Kidney Failure''. ' "
Hope Through Research,"'The NIDDK, through its Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases, supports several programs and studies devoted to improving treatment for patients with progressive kidney disease and permanent kidney failure, including patients on hemodialysis. ''The U.S. Government does not endorse or favor any specific commercial product or company. Trade, proprietary, or company names appearing in this document are used only because they are considered necessary in the context of the information provided. If a product is not mentioned, the omission does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory. ' The End-Stage Renal Disease Program promotes research to reduce medical problems from bone, blood, nervous system, metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and endocrine abnormalities in kidney failure and to improve the effectiveness of dialysis and transplantation. The research focuses on evaluating different hemodialysis schedules and on finding the most useful information for measuring dialysis adequacy. The program also seeks to increase kidney graft and patient survival and to maximize quality of life. The HEMO Study, completed in 2002, tested the theory that a higher dialysis dose and/or high-flux membranes would reduce patient mortality (death) and morbidity (medical problems). Doctors at 15 medical centers recruited more than 1,800 hemodialysis patients and randomly assigned them to high or standard dialysis doses and high- or low-flux filters. The study found no increase in the health or survival of patients who had a higher dialysis dose, who dialyzed with high-flux filters, or who did both. The U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) collects, analyzes, and distributes information about the use of dialysis and transplantation to treat kidney failure in the United States. The USRDS is funded directly by the NIDDK in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The USRDS publishes an Annual Data Report, which identifies the total population of people being treated for kidney failure; reports on incidence, prevalence, death rates, and trends over time; and develops data on the effects of various treatment approaches. The report also helps identify problems and opportunities for more focused special studies of renal research issues. The Hemodialysis Vascular Access Clinical Trials Consortium is conducting a series of multicenter, clinical trials of drug therapies to reduce the failure and complication rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas in hemodialysis. These studies are randomized and placebo controlled, which means the studies meet the highest standard for scientific accuracy. AV grafts and fistulas prepare the arteries and veins for regular dialysis. See the NIDDK fact sheet Vascular Access for Hemodialysis for more information. Recently developed drugs to prevent blood clots may be evaluated in these large clinical trials. "

What is the definition of asbestos? Where does asbestos come from?,"'Asbestos is a family of naturally occurring silica compounds (similar to, but not the same as, the silica of window glass and computer chips) found in rocks and soil. These substances form fibers with varying shapes and sizes and are found throughout the earth. There are three commonly available types of asbestos:''There are two major groups of fibers, the amphiboles and chrysotile fibers, and all three have been associated with cancerous and non-cancerous lung disease.''The risk of developing asbestos-related ''lung cancer'' varies between ''fiber'' types. Studies of groups of patients exposed chrysotile fibers show only a moderate increase in risk. On the other hand, exposure to amphibole fibers or to both types of fibers increases the risk of lung cancer by two fold. Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has a standard for workplace exposure to asbestos (0.2 fibers/milliliter of air), there is debate over what constitutes a safe level of exposure. While some believe asbestos-related disease is a ""threshold phenomenon,"" which requires a certain level of exposure for disease to occur, others believe there is no safe level of asbestos.''In most buildings, asbestos does not become airborne. However, surfaces that are damaged or disturbed can cause asbestos to become inhalable. High concentrations can occur after cutting, sanding, or remodeling asbestos- containing materials.''Reducing asbestos exposure involves either the removal or sealing of asbestos-containing materials. Inexperienced attempts to remove asbestos can release dangerous levels of the fibers.''Asbestos has been used frequently in a variety of building materials for insulation and as a fire retardant, and in brake pads in cars. Today, it is found most commonly in older homes - in pipes, furnaces, roof ''shingles'', millboard, textured paints, coating materials, and floor tiles.' chrysotile (white asbestos), amosite (brown asbestos), and crocidolite (blue asbestos). Chrysotile (white asbestos), also called ""Serpentine"" fibers, are long and curled. The amphiboles, long straight fibers (including actinolite, amosite, anthrophyllite, crocidolite, and tremolite) are much more likely to cause cancer of the lining of the lung (mesothelioma) and scarring of the lining of the lung (pleural fibrosis). Either group of fibers can cause disease of the lung, such as asbestosis."
Why is asbestos harmful to your health? How can I tell If I've been exposed to asbestos fibers?,"'Lung disease from exposure to asbestos can be divided into three main types: 1) asbestosis, 2) disease of the lining of the lung (pleura), and 3) lung cancer.''All of the commonly available commercial forms of asbestos have been linked to cancerous and non-cancerous lung disease.''Depending on their shape and size, asbestos fibers deposit in different areas of the lung. Fibers less than 3 mm easily move into the lung tissue and the lining surrounding the lung (pleura). Long fibers, greater than 5 mm (1/5 inch), cannot be completely broken down by scavenger cells (macrophages) and remain in the lung tissue. These asbestos fibers can cause inflammation. Substances damaging to the lungs are then released by the cells of inflammation that are responding to the foreign asbestos material. The persistence of these long fibers in the lung tissue and the resulting inflammation seem to initiate the process of cancer formation.''As inflammation and damage to tissue around the asbestos fibers continues, the resulting scarring can extend from the small airways to the larger airways and the tiny air sacs (alveoli) at the end of the airways. Some of these fibers can move to the surface of the lung where they form plaques (white-gray regions of scarred tissue) in the tissue lining of the lung (pleura). In severe cases of asbestosis, scarring of both the lung and its lining tissue can occur.''Asbestos-related lung disease occurred at very high rates toward the middle of the 20th century, when patients who were exposed decades earlier to asbestos eventually developed disease. British asbestos workers were among the first who were observed to have lung cancer related to asbestos.''About 125 million people worldwide are exposed to asbestos in the workplace, and most people with lung disease from asbestos exposure were exposed to it from:''Some workers have been exposed to high concentrations of asbestos in:''Continuing sources of exposure are asbestos removal and general construction industries. The delay between exposure to asbestos and the development of cancer can be anywhere from 10 to 40 or more years.''Despite not using asbestos in construction materials for the last 30 years, the number of deaths from asbestosis has increased over the past two decades. A 2009 study to assess the incidence of asbestos-related deaths concluded that the death rate is not expected to decrease sharply in the next 10 to 15 years. Each year in the US, asbestos exposure kills about 12,000 to 15,000 people. Some World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers have asbestos exposure lung disease.' Asbestosis is a process of widespread scarring of the lungs. Disease of the lining of the lungs, called the pleura, has a variety of signs and symptoms and is the result of inflammation and the hardening (calcification) and/or thickening of the lining tissue. Lung cancer, either of the internal portions of the lungs or the outer lining (pleura). mines, mills, factories, or homes with asbestos, either in the process of carrying, installing, or removing asbestos, or while cleaning items laden with asbestos dust. automotive repair, boilermaking, construction, pipefitting, launderers of asbestos-containing clothing."
What is asbestosis? What are the symptoms and signs? ,"'Asbestosis is a process of lung tissue scarring caused by asbestos fibers. Because many other diseases also lead to lung scarring, other causes must be excluded first when a patient is found to have lung scarring (''pulmonary fibrosis''). Patients with particular X-ray findings or biopsy results must also have a remote history of asbestos exposure and a characteristically delayed development of the condition in considering asbestosis as a diagnosis. ''Smoking'' appears to increase the frequency and/or the rate of progression of asbestosis, possibly by preventing the efficient elimination of inhaled fibers from the airways.''The clinical symptoms usually include slowly progressing ''shortness of breath'' and ''cough'', often 20 to 40 years after exposure to asbestos. Breathlessness advances throughout the disease, even without further asbestos ''inhalation''. In the absence of ''cigarette smoking'', sputum (''mucus'' coughed up from the lungs) production and ''wheezing'' are uncommon. The exception is workers who have been exposed to very high concentrations of asbestos fibers. Those workers may also develop symptoms as soon as 10 years after exposure. Other indications of asbestosis include abnormal lung sounds on examination, changes in the ends of the fingers and toes (""''clubbing''""), a blue tinge to the fingers or lips (""''cyanosis''""), and failure of the right side of the ''heart'' (""cor pulmonale"").'  "
Is asbestos still used?,"'Chrysotile is the only form of asbestos that is currently in production today. Despite their association with lung cancer, chrysotile products are still used in 60 industrialized and developing countries, according to the industry-sponsored Asbestos Institute. Chrysotile is still being used in cement building materials (90% of the world production of chrysotile), friction materials, gaskets, and certain plastics.''Although the asbestos industry proclaims the ""safety"" of chrysotile fibers, which are now imbedded in less ""friable"" and ""dusty"" products, little is known about the long term effects of current asbestos products because of the long delay to the development of disease. In spite of their potential health risks, the durability and cheapness of these products continue to attract commercial applications. Asbestosis remains a significant clinical problem even after marked reductions in on-the-job exposure to asbestos. Again, this is due to the long period of time between exposure and the onset of disease.' "
What tests diagnose asbestosis?,"'Breathing'' abnormalities can be identified with lung function tests (pulmonary function tests or PFTs) or ''exercise'' tests that are performed at specialized laboratories. Asbestosis can produce both obstruction of airflow and restriction of lung inflation. In addition, the disease can affect the ability to transfer oxygen into the blood. With advanced disease, patients may have markedly reduced blood oxygen at rest and may need supplementary oxygen.''X-ray abnormalities include thickening of the lining of the lungs and tiny lines marking the lower portions of the lungs. However, up to 20% of patients have completely normal-appearing chest X-rays. These patients may demonstrate more subtle changes on computerized X-ray studies (''computerized tomography'', or CT scans). Up to 30% of patients with a normal ''chest X-ray'' who have been exposed to asbestos will have an abnormal high resolution (high definition) CT. The ''CT scan'' may be very useful in separating true asbestosis from other conditions that may have similar findings. However, even a CT scan may not identify disease of the lining of the lung (pleural disease) in patients with asbestosis. The proper role of CT scanning has not been fully established.''Laboratory testing studies may be abnormal (certain antibodies and markers of inflammation), but they do not specifically suggest asbestosis.''Occasionally, a biopsy and microscopic examination of the lung is used to diagnose asbestosis. Under microscopic examination, certain coated fibers (asbestos bodies) can be seen in association with a pattern of scarring. The amount of both coated and uncoated (transparent) asbestos has been linked to the severity of asbestosis. Because other particles may resemble asbestos, a conclusive identification may require scanning electron microscopy. Currently, detection of asbestos fibers in the lung tissue and fluids (sputum, secretions) can be used to make the diagnosis, along with a history of asbestos exposure and characteristic X-ray or CT results.''The currently available commercial form of asbestos, chrysotile, does not form asbestos bodies as easily as previously used fibers. '  "
What is the treatment for asbestosis?,"'Patients with asbestosis, like others with chronic lung disease, are at a higher risk of serious infection, low oxygen levels in the blood, and ''heart failure''. These patients also may not recover as quickly from viral and ''bacterial infections''. In addition, they may be at increased risk for certain fungal and unusual infections that take advantage of diseased or scarred lung tissue. The medical management of these patients should focus special attention on preventing and rapidly treating these infections. ''Flu'' and pneumococcal vaccinations are a part of routine care for these patients. There is, however, no treatment or cure for asbestosis. In particular, steroid and immune-based therapies have not been shown to benefit these patients.''Other key elements in treating patients with asbestosis are ''smoking'' cessation, early detection of worsening disease or cancer, and avoidance of further exposure to asbestos. Supplemental oxygen during ''exercise'' or at rest (depending on the need) may be provided to improve daily function.' "
What is asbestos-related pleural disease? What are the symptoms and signs?,"'Another type of lung disease that is linked to asbestos exposure involves the lining of the lungs, called the pleura. Harmless disease of the pleura is often the only manifestation of asbestos exposure. There are a number of different changes that can occur in the pleura with asbestos exposure. Pleural plaques may develop from fibers that migrate out to the outside edge of the lungs and cause scarring of the pleura. Pleural ""calcification"" may occur from calcium deposits in areas of prior damage.''Fluid may accumulate around the lung. This fluid collection, called a ''pleural effusion'', can be the first sign of asbestos-related disease. Often, these fluid collections have no associated symptoms, resolve on their own, and recur sporadically. However, some patients may experience ''pain'' or bleeding around their lungs. ""Diffuse pleural thickening,"" which means a generalized thickening of the lining of the lung, can occur as well. The thickened pleura may form a peel of ''scar tissue'"" and even affect the lung's ability to expand. This condition may cause a significant shortness of breath. Diffuse pleural thickening is considered a later-onset consequence of repeated fluid accumulations."" "
Can asbestos exposure cause lung cancer?,"'Although exposure to asbestos alone can lead to lung cancer, the risk increases dramatically in ''smokers'' of cigarettes or other forms of tobacco.''Lung cancer in asbestos-exposed and unexposed individuals is similar in both the type of cancer and its signs and symptoms. The link between ''cigarette smoking'', asbestos, and cancer of the lung itself does not apply to cancer of the lining of the lung (malignant mesothelioma ). Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is a complex topic and a pulmonary specialist should be involved in the workup of a suspected lung cancer.''Asbestos is the only known risk factor for malignant mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the tissue lining the lung (pleura) or abdomen (peritoneum). Malignant mesothelioma is not associated with ''cigarette smoking'' but is strongly linked with the degree of asbestos exposure. However, 20% to 40% of patients with malignant mesothelioma have no prior asbestos exposure. In malignant mesothelioma, there is a very long duration between exposure and the onset of disease, usually greater than 30 years.' In nonsmokers who have been exposed to asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is five times that of unexposed workers. Smokers who are exposed to asbestos have a 50 to 84 times greater risk of lung cancer, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry."
What other cancers may be caused asbestos exposure?,"'Other malignancies have been linked to asbestos, including ''cancers'' of the voice box (larynx), upper throat (oropharynx), kidney, ''esophagus'', and gallbladder.' "
How can you reduce asbestos exposure?,"'The basic principle for asbestos is to leave material that is in good condition alone. Periodic inspection and maintenance by an expert in asbestos abatement should be undertaken for areas with sealed or contained asbestos. Local health, environmental, and building safety officials are good sources for local and state regulations on asbestos handling, disposal, and certified workers. If you discover even a very small amount of asbestos in your building, contact a professional for repair, removal, or remodeling.' "
What is ascariasis?,"'Ascariasis is one of the tropical diseases caused by the parasite ''Ascaris lumbricoides'', a large nematode (roundworm) that infects humans in the gastrointestinal tract and requires human infection to complete its complex life cycle. Another species, ''Ascaris suum'', which infects pigs may occasionally infect humans.' "
What is Ascaris lumbricoides? What do Ascaris worms look like?,"'Ascaris lumbricoides'', also known as roundworm, ''Ascaris'' worms, or giant roundworm, is a nematode parasite that can infect humans by residing in the gastrointestinal tract or in other areas of the body such as the ''lungs''. The worms have a worldwide distribution but are most common in tropical and subtropical areas where humans have poor sanitation and where human feces is used as soil fertilizer. Many individuals infected show no symptoms, but abdominal discomfort and/or ''cough'' are two major symptoms of infection.''The roundworms are the largest nematode parasites that live in the human intestine. Figures 1 and 2 show how large and how numerous these intestinal parasites can be. Figure 3 shows the life cycle of the worms in the human -- from ingestion to penetration of the intestinal lining to migration and maturation in the lungs, migration to the throat and then to small intestine where they mature and produce eggs that are passed with ''stool'', where they await ingestion by other humans.''Worm infections (helminthic or helminth infections) are a group of diseases caused by parasites transmitted through contaminated soil. These parasites include whipworms, hookworms, and roundworms (''Ascaris'' and ''Strongyloides'' that cause strongyloidiasis). The diseases they cause are termed helminthiasis. This article is limited to ''Ascaris lumbricoides'' infections.' "
What causes ascariasis?,"'The cause of ascariasis is the invasion, spread, and eventual maturation of ''Ascaris lumbricoides'"" in the human host. The symptoms described below are due to the parasite's ability to penetrate the intestinal tract and proceed from there to the lungs where they eventually mature further and penetrate the air sacs of the lungs, migrate to the throat, and are subsequently swallowed to allow maturation in the intestinal tract."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of an ascariasis infection?,"""The incubation period is variable because the parasite's life cycle may take four to eight weeks to be completed. The signs and symptoms of the nematode infection by ""'Ascaris lumbricoides'' may include the following:'   Abdominal discomfort Abdominal cramping Abdominal swelling (especially in children) Fever Coughing and/or wheezing Nausea Vomiting Passing roundworms and their eggs in the stool"
What are the risk factors for developing ascariasis?,"'Although the nematodes exist worldwide, the most common areas they inhabit are areas where the climate is warm and moist such as tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The highest risk factors for contracting this infection are poor sanitation and poor hygiene. Ascariasis is transmitted indirectly in most cases by an uninfected individual ingesting contaminated food or water that contain the ''Ascaris'' eggs deposited by infected humans in their feces into the environment. Children are commonly infected in these areas; school-age children are more frequently infected than adults are.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose ascariasis?,"'Health care providers easily diagnose infection by examining the stool sample from the patient using a microscope to identify ''Ascaris lumbricoides'' eggs. In some instances, stool particles are concentrated to increase the likelihood of finding the nematode eggs. Other tests that suggest infection include blood tests that show eosinophilia (the increased presence of a certain type of white blood cell); abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound studies may detect a large mass of worms in the ''intestines''.' "
What is the treatment for ascariasis?,"'Fortunately, there are effective anthelmintic treatments available for ascariasis. Medications such as single-dose ''albendazole'' (''Albenza'') or ''mebendazole'' (''Vermox'') are ''drugs'' of choice for ascariasis. Health care providers administer the drugs for only about one to three days. Other drugs such as ''ivermectin'' (''Stromectol''), ''levamisole'' (''Ergamisol''), ''pyrantel'' pamoate (Pin Rid, Pin X), ''nitazoxanide'', and piperazine citrate have also been used effectively. Pyrantel pamoate treats ''pregnant'' women; other drugs like mebendazole and albendazole may cause teratogenic effects in the fetus.'  "
What type of specialists treat ascariasis?,"'Once diagnosed, primary care physicians can treat most patients for ascariasis. However, if complications like bowel blockage or intestinal perforation occur, other doctors such as a surgeon and/or infectious disease specialist may need to be consulted. Other severe complications can involve the lungs and may require a lung specialist (pulmonologist) to be consulted.' "
Are there home remedies for ascariasis?,"'There are a number of home remedies for ascariasis. ''Garlic'', ''wormwood'', pumpkin seeds, and many other herbs have been used to treat ascariasis. However, infected individuals should check with their doctor before utilizing any of these home remedies as their effectiveness might not be as good or as rapid as the prescription medications described in the treatment section.' "
What are the complications of ascariasis?,"'There are a number of complications that may occur with untreated ascariasis. Following is a list of these complications:''Organs other than the intestinal tract and lungs may be occasionally involved; some patients may have ''allergic'' reactions that may become severe. About 11,000 deaths occur each year worldwide due to intestinal obstructions caused by ascariasis, with the majority of patients being children.' Bowel obstruction (intestinal blockage) Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) Peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal cavity lining) Intussusception (an intestinal condition in which part of the intestine is pulled into itself, creating an obstruction) Volvulus (abnormal twisting of the intestine) Peritoneal granulomas (scar tissue lining the abdomen) Hepatic (liver) abscesses Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) Death"
What is the prognosis of ascariasis?,"'The prognosis of ascariasis for appropriately diagnosed and treated ascariasis is very good. However, the prognosis begins to decline if the patient develops a high number of worms in the body (worm burden). This worm burden can lead to more serious complications such as intestinal obstruction and worsens the prognosis of this disease. A female worm may reach a length of 14 inches (35cm).''An interesting additional effect of ascariasis may be increased fertility in women who have the infection. Researchers in Bolivia suggest that the worm alters the immune system for its own protection that results also in allowing females to become pregnant easier. The mechanism of this enhanced fertility is unknown, but researchers suggest it could lead to development of fertility-enhancing drugs.' "
Is it possible to prevent ascariasis?,"'Yes, it is possible to prevent ascariasis; before handling or eating any food, wash hands with soap and water and avoid drinking any local water sources when traveling. Use only boiled water or bottled water and avoid raw vegetables and fruits unless you can clean them yourself.'""While traveling, eat only foods that are cooked well and served hot. In addition, reinfection is possible for people who live in areas where ascariasis infections are common. Consequently, health care providers give some individuals, especially children, prophylactic doses of medication (such as ivermectin) every two or three years in some countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 10% of the developing world's population has intestinal worm infections, with total worldwide deaths due to ""'Ascaris'' infections at 60,000 per year, mainly occurring in children.' "
What is the medical definition of ascites? What should I know about it?,"'The medical definition of ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the (peritoneal) ''cavity''. Ascites is caused by a variety of diseases and conditions, for example, ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'', ''cancer'' within the abdomen, ''congestive heart failure'', and ''tuberculosis''.''Ascites is one of the most common liver diseases that is caused by ''cirrhosis'' of the liver. Signs and symptoms of ascites include ''abdominal pain'' and ''bloating'', ''shortness of breath'', and liver failure.''To diagnose the cause of ascites, your doctor and other healthcare professionals will examine you around the belly to determine how much fluid is in the peritoneal ''cavity''. Your doctor may have kidney and ''liver function'' tests example, ''electrolytes'', collecting your urine for 24 hours, tests to measure bleeding, and abdominal ''ultrasound''.''Treatment for ascites includes curing or managing the disease causing ascites, limit your fluid intake, avoid ''alcohol'', limit the amount salt in your ''diet'', and other lifestyle changes. Complications of ascites include bleeding from the lower intestine, ''kidney failure'', and other complications of cirrhosis of the liver. The prognosis ascites depends on its underlying causes and severity.'  "
What causes ascites?,"'The most common cause of ascites is advanced ''liver disease'' or cirrhosis. Although the exact mechanism of ascites development is not completely understood, most theories suggest ''portal hypertension'' (increased pressure in the liver blood flow to the liver) as the main contributor. The basic principle is similar to the formation of ''edema'' elsewhere in the body due to an imbalance of pressure between inside the circulation (high pressure system) and outside, in this case, the abdominal cavity (low pressure space). The increase in portal ''blood pressure'' and decrease in albumin (a protein that is carried in the blood) may be responsible in forming the pressure gradient and resulting in abdominal ascites.''Other factors that may contribute to ascites are salt and water retention. The circulating blood volume may be perceived as low by the sensors in the kidneys as the formation of ascites may deplete some volume from the blood. This signals the kidneys to reabsorb more salt and water to compensate for the volume loss.''Some other causes of ascites related to increased pressure gradient are congestive ''heart failure'' and advanced ''kidney failure'' due to generalized retention of fluid in the body.''In rare cases, increased pressure in the portal system can be caused by internal or external obstruction of the portal vessel, resulting in portal ''hypertension'' without cirrhosis. Examples of this can be a mass (or ''tumor'') pressing on the portal vessels from inside the abdominal cavity or ''blood clot'' formation in the portal vessel obstructing the normal flow and increasing the pressure in the vessel (for example, the Budd-Chiari syndrome).''Ascites can also manifest as a result of ''cancers'', called ''malignant'' ascites. This type of ascites is typically a manifestation of advanced cancers of the organs in the abdominal cavity, such as, ''colon cancer'', ''pancreatic cancer'', ''stomach cancer'', ''breast cancer'', ''lymphoma'', ''lung cancer'', or ''ovarian cancer''.''Pancreatic ascites can be seen in people with chronic (long standing) ''pancreatitis'' or inflammation of the pancreas. The most common cause of ''chronic pancreatitis'' is prolonged ''alcohol abuse''. Pancreatic ascites can also be caused by ''acute pancreatitis'' as well as ''trauma'' to the pancreas.'  "
What are the risk factors for ascites?,"'The most common cause of ascites is cirrhosis of the liver. Many of the risk factors for developing ascites and cirrhosis are similar. The most common risk factors include ''hepatitis B'', ''hepatitis C'', and long standing ''alcohol abuse''. Other potential risk factors are related to the other underlying conditions, such as congestive ''heart'' failure, ''malignancy'', and ''kidney disease''.' "
What are the symptoms of ascites?,"'There may be no symptoms associated with ascites especially if it is mild (usually less than about 100 – 400 ml in adults). As more fluid accumulates, increased abdominal girth and size are commonly seen. ''Abdominal pain'', discomfort, and bloating are also frequently seen as ascites becomes larger. Shortness of breath can also happen with large ascites due to increased pressure on the ''diaphragm'' and the migration of the fluid across the diaphragm causing pleural effusions (fluid around the ''lungs''). A cosmetically disfiguring large belly, due to ascites, is also a common concern of some patients.'  "
When should you call a doctor about ascites?,"'People with ascites should be routinely followed by their primary physician and any specialists that may be involved in their care. Gastroenterologists (specialists in gastrointestinal diseases) and hepatologist (liver specialists) commonly see patients with ascites due to ''liver disease''. Other specialists can also care for patients with ascites based on the possible cause and the underlying condition. The specialists usually ask the patient to first contact your primary physician if ascites increase. If ascites is causing symptoms of shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, or inability to do normal daily tasks such as ''walking'', your call your doctor.' "
What are the types of ascites?,"'Traditionally, ascites is divided into 2 types; transudative or exudative. This classification is based on the amount of protein found in the fluid. A more useful system has been developed based on the amount of albumin in the ascitic fluid compared to the serum albumin (albumin measured in the blood). This is called the Serum Ascites Albumin Gradient or SAAG. Ascites related to portal ''hypertension'' (cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, Budd-Chiari) is generally greater than 1.1., and a''scites caused by other reasons'' (malignant, pancreatitis) is lower than 1.1.' "
"What exams, procedures, and tests diagnose the cause of ascites?","'The diagnosis of ascites is based on physical examination in conjunction with a detailed medical history to ascertain the possible underlying causes since ascites is often considered a nonspecific symptom for other diseases. If ascites fluid is greater than 500ml, it can be demonstrated on physical examination by bulging flanks and fluid waves performed by the doctor examining the abdomen. Smaller amounts of fluid may be detected by an ultrasound of the abdomen. Occasionally, ascites is found incidentally by an ultrasound or a ''CT scan'' done for evaluating other conditions.''Diagnosis of underlying conditions causing ascites is the most important part of understanding the reason for a person to develop ascites. The medical history may provide clues to the underlying cause and typically includes questions about previous diagnosis of liver disease, ''viral hepatitis'' infection and its risk factors, alcohol abuse, family history of liver disease, heart failure, ''cancer'' history, and medication history.''Blood work can play an essential role in evaluating the cause of ascites. A complete metabolic panel can detect patterns of liver injury, functional status of the liver and kidney, and ''electrolyte'' levels. A ''complete blood count'' is also useful by providing clues to underlying conditions. Coagulation (clotting) panel abnormalities (prothrombin time) may be abnormal because of liver dysfunction and inadequate production of clotting proteins.''Sometimes the possible underlying causes of ascites may not be determined based on the history, examination, and review of laboratory data and imaging studies. Analysis of the fluid may be necessary in order to obtain further diagnostic data. This procedure is called paracentesis, and it is performed by trained physicians. It involves sterilizing an area on the abdomen and, with the guidance of ultrasound, inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity and withdrawing fluid for further analysis.''For diagnostic purposes, a small amount (20cc, less than a tablespoon, for example) may be enough for adequate testing. Larger amounts of up to a few liters (large volume paracentesis) can be withdrawn if needed to relieve symptoms associated with abdominal ascites.''The analysis is done by sending the collected fluid to the laboratory promptly after drainage. Typically, the number and components of white blood cells and ''red blood cells'' (cell count), albumin level, gram stain and culture for any possible organisms, amylase level, glucose, total protein, and cytology (study of any cells in the fluid looking for malignant or cancerous cells) are analyzed in the laboratory. The results are then analyzed by the treating doctor for further evaluation and determination of the possible cause of ascites.'  "
What is the treatment for ascites?,"'The treatment of ascites largely depends on the underlying cause. For example, peritoneal carcinomatosis or malignant ascites may be treated by surgical resection of the ''cancer'' and ''chemotherapy'', while management of ascites related to heart failure is directed toward treating heart failure with medical management and dietary restrictions. Because cirrhosis of the liver is the main cause of ascites, it will be the main focus of this section.''Managing ascites in patients with cirrhosis typically involves limiting dietary sodium intake and prescribing diuretics (water pills). Restricting dietary sodium (salt) intake to less than 2 grams per day is very practical, successful, and widely recommended for patients with ascites. In the majority of cases, this approach needs to be combined with the use of diuretics as salt restriction alone is generally not an effective way to treat ascites. Consultation with a ''nutrition'' expert in regards to daily salt restriction can be very helpful for patients with ascites.''Diuretics increase water and salt excretion from the kidneys. The recommended diuretic regimen in the setting of liver related ascites is a combination of ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') and ''furosemide'' (''Lasix''). Single daily dose of 100 milligrams of spironolactone and 40 milligrams of furosemide is the usual recommended initial dosage. This can be gradually increased to obtain appropriate response to the maximum dosage of 400 milligrams of spironolactone and 160 milligrams of furosemide, as long as the patient can tolerate the dose increase without any side effects. Taking these medications together in the morning is typically advised to prevent ''frequent urination'' during the night.''For patients who do not respond well to or cannot tolerate the above regimen, frequent therapeutic paracentesis (a needle carefully is placed into the abdominal area, under sterile conditions) can be performed to remove large amounts of fluid. A few liters (up to 4 to 5 liters) of fluid can be removed safely by this procedure each time. For patients with malignant ascites, this procedure may also be more effective than diuretic use.''For more refractory cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to control the ascites. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is a procedure done through the internal jugular vein (the main vein in the neck) under local anesthesia by an interventional radiologist. A shunt is placed between the portal venous system and the systemic venous system (veins returning blood back to the heart), thereby reducing the portal pressure. This procedure is reserved for patients who have minimal response to aggressive medical treatment. It has been shown to reduce ascites and either limit or eliminate the use of diuretics in a majority of cases performed. However, it is associated with significant complications such as ''hepatic encephalopathy'' (''confusion'') and even death.''More traditional shunt placements (peritoneovenous shunt and systemic portosystemic shunt) have been essentially abandoned due to their high rate of complications.''Finally, liver transplantation for advanced cirrhosis may be considered a treatment for ascites due to liver failure. ''Liver transplant'' involves a very complicated and prolonged process and it requires very close monitoring and management by transplant specialists.'  "
What are the complications of ascites?,"'Some complications of ascites can be related to its amount. The accumulation of fluid may cause ''breathing'' difficulties by compressing the diaphragm or forming a ''pleural effusion''.''Infections are another serious complication of ascites. In patients with ascites related to portal ''hypertension'', bacteria from the gut may spontaneously invade the peritoneal fluid (ascites) and cause an infection. This is called spontaneous bacterial ''peritonitis'' or SBP. Antibodies are rare in ascites and, therefore, the immune response in the ascitic fluid is very limited. The diagnosis of SBP is made by performing a paracentesis and analyzing the fluid for the number of white blood cells or evidence of bacterial growth.''Hepatorenal syndrome is a rare, but serious and potentially deadly (average survival rates range from 2 weeks to about 3 months) complication of ascites related to cirrhosis of the liver leading to progressive kidney failure. The exact mechanism of this syndrome is not well known, but it may result from shifts in fluids, impaired blood flow to the kidneys, overuse of diuretics, and administration of IV contrasts for certain types of radiological studies like ''CT scans'' or ''drugs'' that may be harmful to the kidney.' "
What is the outlook for ascites? What is the life expectancy of ascites? Can ascites be cured?,"'The outlook for people with ascites primarily depend on its underlying cause and severity. In general, the prognosis of malignant ascites is poor. Most cases have a mean survival time between 20 to 58 weeks, depending on the type of malignancy as shown by a group of investigators. Ascites due to cirrhosis usually is a sign of advanced liver disease and it usually has a fair prognosis. Ascites due to heart failure has a better prognosis as the patient may live years with appropriate treatments.' "
Can ascites be prevented?,"'The ''prevention'' of ascites largely involves preventing the risk factors of the underlying conditions leading to ascites.''In patients with known advanced liver disease and cirrhosis of any cause, avoidance of alcohol intake can markedly reduce the risk of forming ascites. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Motrin'', etc.]) should also be limited in patients with cirrhosis as they may diminish the blood flow to the kidneys, thus, limiting the salt and water excretion. Complying with dietary salt restrictions is also another simple preventive measure to reduce ascites.' "
Do vaccines cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)?,"'Many studies that have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and ''autism'' spectrum disorders (ASDs). To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with ASDs.''However, CDC knows that some parents and others still have concerns. To address these concerns, CDC is part of the Inter-Agency ''Autism'' Coordinating Committee (IACC), which is working with the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) on this issue. The job of the NVAC is to advise and make recommendations regarding the National Vaccine Program. Communication between the IACC and NVAC will allow each group to share skills and knowledge, improve coordination, and promote better use of research resources on vaccine topics.' "
Is there an ASD epidemic?,"'More people than ever before are being diagnosed with an ASD. It is unclear exactly how much of this increase is due to a broader definition of ASDs and better efforts in diagnosis. However, a true increase in the number of people with an ASD cannot be ruled out. We believe the increase in the diagnosis of ASDs is likely due to a combination of these factors.''CDC is working with partners to study the prevalence of ASDs over time, so that we can find out if the number of children with these disorders is rising, dropping, or staying the same.''We do know that ASDs are more common than we thought before and should be considered an urgent public health concern.''There is still a lot to learn about ASDs. In addition, increased concern in the communities, continued demand for services, and reports estimating a prevalence of about 1 percent show the need for a coordinated and serious national response to improve the lives of people with ASDs.' "
Can adults be diagnosed with an ASD?,"""Yes, adults can be diagnosed with an ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But, it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis. Because the focus of ASDs has been on children, we still have much to learn about the prevalence and causes of ASDs across the lifespan. Behavioral interventions can be effective for adults coping with a new diagnosis of ""'autism''.' "
How many children with ASDs are being served through public special education programs?,"'In 2007, 258,305 children 6 through 21 years of age and 39,434 children 3 through 5 years of age were served under the ""autism"" classification for special education services. Not all children with an ASD receive special education services under the classification of ""autism,"" so the education data are not meant to represent the actual number of people with an ASD.' "
Has the number of children being served under an ASD classification in public special education programs changed?,"'Yes. between1998 to 2007, the number of 6 to 21 year old children receiving services for an ASD in public special education programs increased from 54,064 to 258,305. While it is clear that more children are getting special education services for ASDs than ever before, it is important to remember that this classification was only added in the early 1990s. Growth in the number of children classified may be caused in part by the addition of autism as a special education category.' "
How do the rates of ASDs in special education compare with those of other special education categories?,"'In 2007, according to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act administrative counts, 5,912,586 children 6 through 21 years of age received services through 13 categories in public special education programs. ""Specific ''learning disability''"" was the most frequent education category identified, followed by ""speech and language impairment."" Together, these two categories made up nearly 64% of all special education placements. The intellectual disability classification accounted for about 8% (487,854). Autism accounted for about 4% (256,863).'""CDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) found the autism rate among 8-year-old children in 2000 to be 6.5 per 1,000. That's lower than the rate for intellectual disability/mental retardation (12.0 per 1,000) but higher than the rate for ""'cerebral palsy'' (3.1 per 1,000), ''hearing loss'' (1.2 per 1,000), and vision impairment (1.2 per 1,000) found among children of the same age.' "
What are mitochondrial diseases?,"'Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn ''sugar'' and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn ''sugar'' and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work the way they should.''There are many types of ''mitochondrial disease'', and they can affect different parts of the body: the brain, kidneys, muscles, heart, eyes, ears, and others. Mitochondrial diseases can affect one part of the body or many parts. The effects can be mild or very serious.''Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, among the mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years.' "
Is there a link between mitochondrial diseases and ASDs?,"'A child with an ASD may or may not have a mitochondrial disease. When children have both an ASD and a mitochondrial disease, they sometimes have other problems too, including ''epilepsy'', problems with muscle tone, or movement disorders.''More research is needed to find out how common it is for people to have an ASD and a mitochondrial disease. Right now, it seems rare. In general, more research about mitochondrial disease and ASDs is needed.' "
What is aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis is a bone condition that results from poor blood supply to an area of bone, causing localized bone death.  This is a serious condition because the dead areas of bone do not function normally, are weakened, and can collapse. Aseptic necrosis is also referred to as avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis. ' "
What causes aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis can be caused by trauma and damage to the blood vessels that supply bone its oxygen. Other causes of poor blood circulation to the bone include a blockage by air or fat (embolism) that obstructs the blood flow through the blood vessels, abnormally thick blood (hypercoagulable state), atherosclerosis (''hardening of the arteries''), or inflammation of the blood vessel walls (''vasculitis''). Steroid medications (cortisone, such as prednisone [Deltasone, Liquid Pred] and methylprednisolone [Medrol, Depo-Medrol]) are the most common medications to cause aseptic necrosis. Typical bones affected by steroids include the femur bone of the hip, the humerus bone of the shoulder, and the tibia bone of the knee, sometimes in combinations and frequently affecting both sides of the body (bilateral). Aseptic necrosis of the jawbone has been associated with the use of medications (bisphosphonates) used to treat high blood calcium levels from ''cancer''.'  "
What are risk factors for aseptic necrosis?,"""Conditions that are risk factors associated with aseptic necrosis include alcoholism, cortisone medications, Cushing's syndrome, radiation exposure, ""'smoking'' cigarettes, sickle cell disease, pancreatitis, ''hyperlipidemia'"", Caisson's disease (dysbarism), ""'Gaucher'' disease, and  ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. Aseptic necrosis of the jawbone has been rarely reported in association with the use of bisphosphonate medication, particularly intravenously including zoledronate (''Zometa'') and pamidronate (''Aredia''). '  "
What are aseptic necrosis symptoms and signs?,"'Aseptic necrosis begins as a painless bone abnormality. It can remain painless. The involved bone often later develops ''pain'', especially with use. For example, if a hip joint develops avascular necrosis in the ball of the hip joint, pain can be noted, especially upon weight-bearing. As the ball of the hip joint collapses from the degeneration of the bone from aseptic necrosis, pain in the groin can be felt with hip rotation and pain can sometimes be noted with rest after weight-bearing. Aseptic necrosis of the knee is often associated with pain or ''limping'' with ''walking''. Aseptic necrosis of the shoulder can be associated with pain and loss of range of motion of the shoulder joint.'  "
How do physicians diagnose aseptic necrosis?,"'The diagnosis of aseptic necrosis can often, but not always, be made with plain film ''X-rays''. By the time changes are apparent by plain film X-ray testing there has been substantial damage to the bone affected. Bone changes visible on plain film X-ray are, therefore, considered a later-stage finding. Earlier signs of avascular necrosis can be detected with an ''MRI'' scan image or suggested by a nuclear ''bone scan'' image.' "
What is the treatment for aseptic necrosis?,"'The treatment of aseptic necrosis is critically dependent on the stage of the condition. Very early stage aseptic necrosis may be managed nonoperatively with rest, partial-weight-bearing crutches, progressive weight-bearing, and observation. Nevertheless, there is often progression of the joint damage. Early aseptic necrosis (before X-ray image changes are evident) can be treated with a surgical operation called a core decompression. This procedure involves removing a core of bone from the involved area and sometimes grafting new bone into the area. This allows new blood supply to form, preserving the bone. Weight-bearing or impact of the involved joint is restricted.''Later stages of aseptic necrosis (when X-ray image changes are apparent) typically lead to seriously damaged bone and joints, requiring joint replacement surgery.'  "
What is the prognosis of aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis causes a serious injury to affected bone. Frequently, this leads to permanent destruction of the adjacent joint. Early core decompression is generally necessary to prevent  collapse of affected bone. Aseptic necrosis can be complicated by complete loss of joint function.' "
Is it possible to prevent aseptic necrosis?,"'People can prevent aseptic necrosis by minimizing the use of steroid medications when possible and by treating underlying medical conditions, such as those described above, that can increase the risk of developing aseptic necrosis. Avoiding trauma to joints can prevent posttraumatic aseptic necrosis. Avoiding ''smoking'' can decrease risk of developing aseptic necrosis.' "
What is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome, also known as Asperger disorder or Asperger syndrome, is one of a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that have effects on an individual's behavior, use of language and communication, and pattern of social interactions. Asperger disorder was formerly characterized as one distinct ""'autism'' spectrum disorder (others included autistic disorder, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and ''pervasive developmental disorder'""-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]), although Asperger's syndrome was considered to be at the milder, or higher-functioning, range of this spectrum. There is still some controversy as to whether Asperger's syndrome should be regarded as a separate clinical entity or simply represents a high-functioning form of ""'autism''. In the revised ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'"") published in May 2013, Asperger's syndrome and autistic disorder have been combined into one condition for diagnostic purposes, known as ASD. This change was controversial, because many experts believe that people formerly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome will not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Also, many experts feel that Asperger's syndrome should be preserved as a separate diagnostic entity to represent a condition related to, but not the same as, autism. Those diagnosed with Asperger's disorder were felt to have a higher-functioning form of autism or autism-related condition. People with Asperger's syndrome typically have normal to above-average intelligence but typically have difficulties with social interactions and often have pervasive, absorbing interests in special topics.""'Asperger\'s syndrome is named for Dr. Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, who first described the condition in 1944. Dr. Asperger described four boys who showed ""a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements."" Because of their obsessive interests in and knowledge of particular subjects, he termed the boys ""little professors."" The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized Asperger disorder as a specific entity and published diagnostic criteria in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV'' (''DSM-IV'') in 1994. Most recently, after significant deliberation, the APA recommended ""subsuming"" Asperger\'s Disorder into Autism Spectrum Disorders for the next edition of the ''DSM-V''.''Today, many experts in the field ''stress'' the particular gifts and positive aspects of Asperger syndrome and consider it to represent a different, but not necessarily defective, way of thinking. Positive characteristics of people with Asperger syndrome have been described as beneficial in many professions and include:''Dr. Temple Grandin, a noted engineer, author, and professor who suffers from Asperger disorder believes that her condition has been an asset in her professional life. Her life and story was featured in a film that first aired in 2010.'""Although the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome is not possible without direct testing and observation of an individual, it has been suggested by some authors that many successful historical figures may have had Asperger's syndrome, including Mozart, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Marie Curie. Of course, definitive diagnosis of historical figures with Asperger's syndrome is not possible, and many of the traits exhibited by people with Asperger's syndrome can also occur because of intellectual giftedness or even ""'attention deficit disorder'' (''ADD'').'   the increased ability to focus on details, the capacity to persevere in specific interests without being swayed by others' opinions, the ability to work independently, the recognition of patterns that may be missed by others, intensity, and an original way of thinking."
What causes Asperger's syndrome?,"""If one accepts the conclusion that Asperger's syndrome is one of the autistic disorders, then the causes of Asperger's syndrome would be expected to be the same as the causes of autism. The precise causes of autistic disorders have not been identified, although an ""'inherited'"" (genetic) component is believed to be involved. Supporting this idea is the fact that Asperger's syndrome has been observed to run in families. In some cases, autistic disorders may be related to toxic exposures, teratogens, problems with ""'pregnancy'' or birth, and ''prenatal'' infections. These environmental influences may act together to modify or potentially increase the severity of the underlying genetic defect.''Some authors have suggested a causal role for ''vaccine'' exposure (particularly ''measles'' vaccine and thimerosal, a mercury preservative used in some ''vaccines'') in autism. However, the overwhelming majority of epidemiologic evidence shows no evidence for an association between immunizations and autism, and experts have discredited this theory.' "
How common is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome is five times more common in boys than in girls. In recent years, the number of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically in the U.S. The reason for the increase is not fully clear, but is likely due to both improvements and modifications in the diagnostic process that result in an increase in the number of children being identified, as well as some degree of true increase in the incidence of the disorders themselves. The CDC notes one out of every 59 children in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder.""""Asperger's syndrome has been estimated to affect two and a half out of every 1,000 children, based upon the total number of children with autistic disorders."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Asperger's syndrome?,"""Social-behavioral symptoms can begin as early as infancy. Characteristic differences are seen in social development, but these changes are hard to identify in toddlers and may be attributed to another condition or not perceived as abnormal. Most cases of Asperger's syndrome are identified when the child is school-aged or older; studies have shown an average age at diagnosis of 11 years. Some of the symptoms that may be present are:""""Another defining characteristic of Asperger's syndrome is the presence of perseverative and obsessive interests in special topics (such as cars or trains, or even more narrow topics such as vacuum cleaners), which may be of little interest to others.""""Language development in children with Asperger's syndrome is generally normal, in contrast to other autistic conditions. Children with Asperger's syndrome have normal scores on tests for language function involving vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. In fact, some experts believe the presence of normal language development distinguishes Asperger's syndrome from high-functioning autism. However, the use or application of language skills is altered in people with Asperger's syndrome:""""In school, children with Asperger's syndrome tend to excel with the rote learning often required in the early grades. As they get older, they may have more difficulties in school due to the nature of reading comprehension and written assignments. Special education support is sometimes, but not always, necessary.""'Sometimes, people with Asperger disorder have other associated psychiatric conditions or may show behaviors that are typical for other conditions. Some common associated conditions include the following (but these are not always present):'   lack of social awareness; lack of interest in socializing/making friends; difficulty making and sustaining friendships; inability to infer the thoughts, feelings, or emotions of others; either gazing too intently or avoiding eye contact; lack of changing facial expression, or use of exaggerated facial expressions; lack of use or comprehension of gestures; inability to perceive nonverbal cues or communications; failure to respect interpersonal boundaries; unusually sensitive to noises, touch, odors, tastes, or visual stimuli; inflexibility and over-adherence to or dependence on routines; and stereotypical and repetitive motor patterns such as hand flapping or arm waving. These interests are unusually repetitive and intense when compared to other children's interests. Specific or narrow interests remain the focus of the child's interest and conversation in spite of efforts to redirect the child's attention. Their speech may be disorganized or not relevant to the discussion, or they may focus too intently on their defined area of interest (see above) in conversations. The child may switch topics for no apparent reason in conversation, often in an attempt to steer the conversation toward his or her area of interest. Changes in voice and speaking (for example, speaking too loudly or dramatically, using an invariant tone or incorrect intonation, loud pitch, or speaking too rapidly or too slowly) can also be seen. Language may be interpreted literally, and difficulties can arise with interpreting language in a specific context. There are difficulties with understanding the subtle use of language, such as irony or sarcasm. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Anxiety disorder Oppositional defiant disorder or other disruptive behavior disorders Depression or other mood disorders"
How do medical professionals diagnose Asperger's syndrome?,"'Diagnosis is based upon interviews and observation of the individual along with interviews of his/her family members and sometimes teachers or counselors. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' is published by the American Psychiatric Association and includes the diagnostic criteria for all recognized psychiatric conditions.''The ''DSM-IV'"" had specific diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome. However, revision of the ""'DSM-IV'' was carried out, with a fifth edition (''DSM-V'"") published in May 2013. In this new version, Asperger's syndrome is included in the same diagnostic group as people with autism and pervasive developmental disorders.""  "
What are the risks or complications of Asperger's syndrome?,"""As mentioned before, Asperger's syndrome may coexist with other psychiatric conditions such as ""'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or ''anxiety'' disorder. Even when ''anxiety'"" disorder is not present, people with Asperger's syndrome may suffer from ""'anxiety'' or hypersensitivity to certain stimuli such as loud noises. In some cases, disruptive behaviors (tantrums, self-injury, and ''aggression'') and/or ''depression'"" may occur in response to the anxiety and frustration experienced by sufferers of Asperger's syndrome. Other behaviors that have been reported in people with Asperger's syndrome include obsessive-compulsive behaviors and difficulties with anger management.""""As with any condition, the degree of severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals, and not all persons with Asperger's syndrome will experience associated psychiatric disorders, ""'depression'', or disruptive behaviors.' "
What are the treatments for Asperger's syndrome?,"""Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach.""""Medical therapy is not effective in treating Asperger syndrome, although medications may be prescribed to help control troubling symptoms or symptoms of other psychiatric conditions that may coexist with Asperger's syndrome. In some cases, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are used for relief of anxiety or depression. Medical treatments for ""'ADHD'' may also be tried if there is significant ''hyperactivity'' and/or distraction.'""A number of behavioral therapies and educational interventions can help people with Asperger's syndrome, although all of these may not be necessary in a given individual. The type of interventions chosen must be based upon the individual's age and needs. Types of interventions that have been shown to be of benefit include:""  efforts to reduce overstimulation or overload of sensory input; supporting executive function skills by provision of an environment that is predictable, structured, and organized; organization skills training; speech/language therapy that addresses the ambiguous use of language and the use of language in social settings; social skills training programs, including training in the awareness of social cognition, use of gestures and facial expressions, and conversational language; adaptive skills or life-skills training; educational supports such as assistance with organization, note-taking, allowing oral rather than written testing, use of scripts, and assistance with reading comprehension and subtlety of language use; and self-advocacy training."
What is the prognosis for Asperger's syndrome?,"""An estimation of the prognosis of Asperger's syndrome is difficult, if not impossible, since affected individuals have variable degrees of impairment, and the provision of treatment can dramatically improve the long-term outlook for people with Asperger's syndrome. In general, when social, behavioral, and educational support is provided as needed, people with Asperger's syndrome can be expected to lead happy and productive lives."" "
Facts you should know about Aspergillus infection," Aspergillus is a genus name that represents over 185 fungal species, some of which cause several types of aspergillosis (fungal allergy or infection) in humans. The causes of an Aspergillus infection are fungi (mold). Risk factors include the following:AsthmaFibrosisTuberculosis (TB) or other lung infectionsChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Immune suppression, such as post-transplant medicationsCancerChemotherapyHigh-dose corticosteroids Asthma Fibrosis Tuberculosis (TB) or other lung infections Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Immune suppression, such as post-transplant medications Cancer Chemotherapy High-dose corticosteroids Aspergillus infection signs and symptoms vary with the type of aspergillosis but all include airway problems that range from mild to severe. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the fungal genus and species by tests, biopsy, and microscopic observation. Treatment options depend on the disease type and severity and may include antifungal drugs, corticosteroids, and/or surgery. Complications include blood clots, multiple organ damage, organ failure, and fatal bleeding. The prognosis of allergic types of aspergillosis is good to fair, but invasive types have a poor prognosis. It is possible to reduce the risk of aspergillosis by avoiding airborne dust and mold, mold removal, and using antifungal medications appropriately."
What is Aspergillus? What are the types of Aspergillus?,"'Aspergillus'' is the genus name for a group (over 185 species) of filamentous fungi or common molds, most of which occur in an asexual state, and reproduce by producing conidia (asexual spores or conidiophores) that can spread into many different environments, germinate, and then grow. About 20 species cause infections in humans. ''Aspergillus fumigatus'' is the most common of the group, followed by ''Aspergillus flavus'' and ''Aspergillus brasiliensis'' (formerly termed ''niger''). ''Aspergillus penicillium'' is mainly allergenic. That means this species tends to induce a hypersensitive (allergic) reaction instead of infecting the body. Other types or species such as ''Aspergillus clavatus'', the ''Aspergillus glaucus'' group, ''Aspergillus nidulans'', ''Aspergillus oryzae'', ''Aspergillus terreus'', ''Aspergillus ustus'', and ''Aspergillus versicolor'' less commonly cause disease (note...species may have different names). Infections that these fungi cause are termed aspergillosis. These fungi may cause lung (''Aspergillus'' ''pneumonia'') and other organ infections and allergic reactions (mold ''allergy'' or ABPA [allergic ''bronchopulmonary'' aspergillosis], for example). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) web site lists several types of aspergillosis:' ABPA (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) (not infectious) Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis (not infectious) Azole-resistant (meaning resistant to azole antifungal drugs like miconazole or ketoconazole) Aspergillus fumigatus (infection) Aspergilloma -- a ball of fungus that grows in an organ like the lung Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis -- cavities or fungal ball formations (for 3 or more months) Invasive aspergillosis -- aspergillosis spreads to one area in the lungs and/or to more than more than one organ system Cutaneous (skin) aspergillosis -- aspergillosis infection that starts in a skin break (skin infection) or spreads to the skin from another body site"
What are the causes and risk factors of an Aspergillus infection?,"'The cause of an ''Aspergillus'' infection is a fungus (mold) that may, if conditions are favorable, spread and damage tissue and human organs. However, most people breathe in ''Aspergillus'' spores (conidia) daily with no ill effects. In general, people who develop any type of ''Aspergillus'' infection have risk factors that have airway compromise and/or weak immune systems. The following are some examples of risk factors:' Asthma Fibrosis TB or other lung infections COPD Immune suppression, including medications taken after an organ transplant Cancer Chemotherapy High-dose corticosteroids"
What are Aspergillus infection symptoms and signs?,"'Aspergillus'' infection signs and symptoms vary with the type of aspergillosis:' ABPAWheezingShortness of breathCoughFever (rarely) Wheezing Shortness of breath Cough Fever (rarely) Allergic Aspergillus sinusitisStuffinessHeadacheRunny noseReduced ability to smell Stuffiness Headache Runny nose Reduced ability to smell AspergillomaCoughBloody sputum (hemoptysis) Cough Bloody sputum (hemoptysis) Chronic pulmonary aspergillosisFatigueWeight lossCoughBloody sputum (hemoptysis)Shortness of breath Fatigue Weight loss Cough Bloody sputum (hemoptysis) Shortness of breath Invasive aspergillosisFever and chillsCoughBloody sputum (hemoptysis)Difficulty breathingChest and/or joint painSkin lesions if fungi invade the skinSpread from lungs to other organs cause symptoms like bone, liver, and ear infectionDeath Fever and chills Cough Bloody sputum (hemoptysis) Difficulty breathing Chest and/or joint pain Skin lesions if fungi invade the skin Spread from lungs to other organs cause symptoms like bone, liver, and ear infection Death"
How do doctors diagnose an Aspergillus infection?,"""Doctors make a diagnosis by evaluating a patient's history, risk factors, symptoms, physical exam, lab tests, and imaging tests like a ""'chest X-ray'' or CT. They may send respiratory fluid for tests (for example, ''Aspergillus'' galactomannan test, a blood test that detects galactomannan, a molecule found in the cell wall of ''Aspergillus'') and microscopic exams (view ''Aspergillus'' hyphae and conidia), and they may examine and/or culture biopsy samples.' "
What are treatment options for an Aspergillus infection?,"'Treatment options depend on the aspergillosis disease type and severity.''Although many individuals have died from the invasive disease, there is one report that states voriconazole cured a patient of invasive ''Aspergillus'"". Thus, the disease may be curable in some people. Curability should be discussed with the patient's doctor."" Allergic types of aspergillosis: the antifungal medication itraconazole, corticosteroid Aspergilloma: antifungal medications are the same for invasive aspergillosis listed below and/or surgical removal Invasive types and chronic types of aspergillosis (including cutaneous or skin types): antifungal medications such as voriconazole, lipid amphotericin formulations, posaconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin, and/or micafungin"
What are possible complications of an Aspergillus infection?,"'A rapidly invasive infection is dangerous because it may cause multiple organ damage, organ failure, and death without treatment. Aspergillomas may cause blood clots and/or fatal bleeding in the lungs.' "
What is the prognosis of an Aspergillus infection?,"""The prognosis of allergic types of the disease is good to fair and depends on the patient's response to therapy. Unfortunately, invasive types have a poor prognosis as only about 25%-60% may respond to therapy and many patients relapse. Also, over long-term therapy, the fungi may develop resistance to some antifungals."" "
Is it possible to prevent an Aspergillus infection?,"'It is possible to reduce the risk of ''Aspergillus'' infections, especially in people with weak immune systems, by avoiding activities that cause dust and mold to become airborne, like mowing grass. Mold removal (in home or workplace) by certified technicians may reduce risk. Isolation precautions for transplant patients and others when white blood cell levels are very low may also reduce risk. Some people with suppressed immune systems may take antifungal medications prophylactically, meaning that they are given to prevent infection.' "
What is a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"""A joint aspiration is a procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain synovial fluid from a patient's joint. Joint aspiration is typically performed by a doctor or ancillary health care provider as an office procedure or at the bedside of hospitalized patients. Joint aspiration is sometimes called joint drainage and is medically referred to as arthrocentesis."" "
"How do patients prepare for a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and does it cause pain?","""Patients do not need any special preparation before a joint aspiration. The aspiration is easily performed in a doctor's office as an outpatient procedure. ""'Pain'"" is minimized by topical or local anesthetics applied onto the patient's skin or just beneath the skin. Usually, there is a momentary, slight amount of ""'pain'"" as the needle is inserted into the patient's joint space. Withdrawal of the fluid into the syringe does not typically cause pain. Injection of medication into the joint does not typically cause pain. There is very slight pain sometimes as the needle is withdrawn from the joint. Any pain is reduced by topical or local anesthetics that block pain sensation."" "
"What is the purpose of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and when is it performed?","'Joint aspiration can be both used for diagnosis and medical treatment of ''arthritis'"" of a joint. Joint aspiration is used to obtain fluid from the patient's joint for examination in the laboratory. Analysis of joint fluid can help the physician to define causes of ""'joint swelling'' (joint effusion) or arthritis, such as infection, ''gout'' arthritis, and ''rheumatoid disease''. Fluid from the joint can be tested for white cell count, crystals, protein, glucose, as well as cultured to detect infection. Each of these laboratory parameters can be helpful in defining the cause of a particular form of arthritis, particularly in distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory forms of arthritis. The result can be key to identifying various potential ''rheumatology'' diseases and musculoskeletal conditions.''Joint aspiration can also be a helpful treatment in relieving joint swelling and pain. Removal of synovial fluid from the joint that is inflamed can also remove the white blood cells within that are sources of enzymes that can be destructive to the joint. This treatment can more rapidly restore the health of the joint. Bursa aspiration procedure and indications for ''bursitis'' are analogous to joint aspiration for arthritis, except the bursa is the target instead of the joint (intra-articular). The result and analysis of the fluid (aspirate) is similarly evaluated for various diseases and conditions in the laboratory.' "
What is a joint injection?,"'A ''joint injection'' is a procedure whereby a medicine is injected into the joint space with a needle and syringe. Occasionally, cortisone (an anti-inflammatory medication) or ''hyaluronic acid'' derivatives (a synthetic joint lubricant, approved for pain relief of the knee in ''degenerative arthritis'') are injected into the joint during the joint aspiration. ''Cortisone injection'' can rapidly relieve ''joint inflammation'' and further reduce symptoms. Simultaneous joint aspiration followed by joint injection can often be done by changing the aspiration syringe with the syringe for the injection (such as for steroid injection). In this way, the joint injection does not need to be done as a separate procedure. ' "
How is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) performed?,"'The skin over the joint is cleaned by the health care professional using a liquid, typically an ''iodine'' solution (Betadine). Local anesthetic is used in the area of the joint; either by injection, a topical liquid coolant, or both. A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint (joint injection) and joint fluid is drawn back under suction (aspirated) into the syringe. For certain diseases and medical conditions, the health care professional will also inject medicine into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed and a Band-Aid or dressing is applied over the entry point.' "
Who performs a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspirations can be performed under medical guidelines by qualified doctors, including general physicians, internists, orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', interventional radiologists, emergency room physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.' "
Who should not undergo joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There are few health contraindications to a joint aspiration. People who are taking blood-thinning medicines (''anticoagulants'' such as ''warfarin'' [''Coumadin'']) for underlying health reasons can have bleeding into the joint. The risk of this is extremely low, unless the level of blood thinner is too high (making the blood very thin), in which case the procedure may need to be temporarily delayed. The risk of bleeding into the joint is minimized when the physician uses the thinnest needle possible and applies ''cold'' packs after the procedure. If the skin over a joint is infected, the joint should not be aspirated, in order to prevent the infection from spreading into the joint.' "
What are complications of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Medical complications of joint aspiration are uncommon. Possible complications of the aspiration procedure include a reaction to the local anesthetic, local ''bruising'' or, minor bleeding into the joint. If cortisone is used, there may be loss of pigment in the skin (a light-colored spot may develop). A rare but serious complication of the procedure is infection of the joint (''septic arthritis'').''With ''corticosteroid'' injections, additional uncommon complications include inflammation in the joint as a result of the medication crystallizing, shrinkage (atrophy) or loss of pigment of skin at the injection site, increased blood ''sugar'' (worsening of ''diabetes mellitus''), and aggravation of preexisting infection elsewhere in the body. If multiple injections with ''corticosteroids'' are given too frequently, it is possible to develop systemic side effects (side effects throughout the body), such as ''weight gain'', puffy face and trunk, and ''easy bruising''. Injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives may cause local inflammation and swelling of the joint due to a reaction to the medication. Hyaluronic acid injections into the ''knee joint'' for pain relief are generally given no more frequently than every six months.'  "
What is the recovery time for joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There is no recovery time required after joint aspiration. Doctors typically will suggest avoiding stressful activity with the joint for at least 24 hours, especially if medication (such as steroid injection) has been injected by joint injection. If pain increases after the procedure while at home, the doctor should be notified. ' "
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is asthma?,"'Asthma is a disorder of the ''lungs'' that causes intermittent symptoms. In the airways there is:''The ''symptoms of asthma'' include:' Swelling or inflammation, specifically in the airway linings Production of large amounts of mucus that is thicker than normal Narrowing because of muscle contractions surrounding the airways Feeling short of breath Frequent coughing, especially at night Wheezing (a whistling noise during breathing) Difficulty breathing Chest tightness"
What is adult-onset asthma?,"'When a doctor makes a diagnosis of asthma in people older than age 20, it is known as adult-onset asthma.''Among those who may be more likely to get adult-onset asthma are:''Irritants that bring on asthma symptoms are called ""asthma triggers."" Asthma brought on by workplace triggers is called ""occupational asthma''.''""'   Women who are having hormonal changes, such as those who are pregnant or who are experiencing menopause Women who take estrogen following menopause for 10 years or longer People who have just had certain viruses or illnesses, such as a cold or flu People with allergies, especially to cats People who have GERD, a type of chronic heartburn with reflux People who are exposed to environmental irritants, such as tobacco smoke, mold, dust, feather beds, or perfume."
What is the difference between childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma?,'Adults tend to have a lower forced expiratory volume (the volume of air you are able to take in and forcibly exhale in one second) after middle age because of changes in muscles and stiffening of chest walls. This decreased lung function may cause doctors to miss the diagnosis of adult-onset asthma.' 
How is adult-onset asthma diagnosed?,"'Your asthma doctor may diagnose adult-onset asthma by:'   Taking a medical history, asking about symptoms, and listening to you breathe Performing a lung function test, using a device called a spirometer, to measure how much air you can exhale after first taking a deep breath and how fast you can empty your lungs. You may be asked before or after the test to inhale a short-acting bronchodilator (medicine that opens the airways by relaxing tight muscles and that also help clear mucus from the lungs). Performing a methacholine challenge test; this asthma test may be performed if your symptoms and spirometry test do not clearly show asthma. When inhaled, methacholine causes the airways to spasm and narrow if asthma is present. During this test, you inhale increasing amounts of methacholine aerosol mist before and after spirometry. The methacholine test is considered positive, meaning asthma is present, if the lung function drops by at least 20%. A bronchodilator is always given at the end of the test to reverse the effects of the methacholine. Performing a chest X-ray. An X-ray is an image of the body that is created by using low doses of radiation reflected on special film or a fluorescent screen. X-rays can be used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, from bronchitis to a broken bone. Your doctor might perform an X-ray exam on you in order to see the structures inside your chest, including the heart, lungs, and bones. By viewing your lungs, your doctor can see if you have a condition other than asthma that may account for your symptoms. Although there may be signs on an X-ray that suggest asthma, a person with asthma will often have a normal chest X-ray."
Who gets asthma?,'Anyone can get asthma at any age. Among those at higher risk for asthma are people who:' Have a family history of asthma Have a history of allergies (allergic asthma) Have smokers living in the household Live in urban areas
How is asthma classified?,"""Asthma is classified into four categories based upon frequency of symptoms and objective measures, such as peak flow measurements and/or spirometry results. These categories are: mild intermittent; mild persistent; moderate persistent; and severe persistent. Your physician will determine the severity and control of your asthma based on how frequently you have symptoms and on lung function tests. It is important to note that a person's asthma symptoms can change from one category to another.""'Mild intermittent asthma''Mild persistent asthma''Moderate persistent asthma''Severe persistent asthma' Symptoms occur less than three times a week, and nighttime symptoms occur less than two times per month. Lung function tests are greater than 80% of predicted values. Predictions are often made on the basis of age, sex, and height. No medications are needed for long-term control. Symptoms occur three to six times per week. Lung function tests are greater than 80% of predicted values. Nighttime symptoms three to four times a month. Symptoms occur daily. Nocturnal symptoms greater than five times per month. Asthma symptoms affect activity, occur more than two times per week, and may last for days. There is a reduction in lung function, with a lung function test range of 60% to 80% of predicted values. Symptoms occur continuously, with frequent nighttime asthma. Activities are limited. Lung function is decreased to less than 60% of predicted values."
How is asthma treated?,"""Asthma can be controlled, but there's no asthma cure. There are, however, certain goals in asthma treatment. If you are unable to achieve all of these goals, it means your asthma is not under control. You should contact your asthma care provider for help with asthma.""'Treatment goals include the following:''Properly using asthma medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is the basis of good asthma control, in addition to avoiding triggers and monitoring daily asthma symptoms. There are two main types of ''asthma medications'':''Asthma medications can be taken by inhaling the medications (using a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, or asthma nebulizer) or by swallowing oral medications (pills or liquids). If you are also taking ''drugs'' for other conditions, you should work with your providers to check ''drug interactions'' and simplify medications when possible.'  Live an active, normal life. Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms. Attend work or school every day. Perform daily activities without difficulty. Stop urgent visits to the doctor, emergency room, or hospital. Use and adjust medications to control asthma with little or no side effects. Anti-inflammatories: This is the most important type of medication for most people with asthma. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as inhaled steroids, reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. As a result, airways are less sensitive and less likely to react to triggers. These medications need to be taken daily, and may need to be taken for several weeks before they begin to control asthma. Anti-inflammatories lead to a reduction in symptoms, better airflow, less sensitive airways, less airway damage, and fewer asthma episodes. If taken every day, they are helpful in controlling or preventing asthma. Oral steroids are taken for acute flares and help increase the efficacy of other medications and help reduce inflammation. Bronchodilators: These medications relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways. This action rapidly opens the airways, letting more air in and out of the lungs and improving breathing. As the airways open, the mucus moves more freely and can be coughed out more easily. In short-acting forms, bronchodilators known as beta-agonists relieve or stop asthma symptoms and are very helpful during an asthma episode. In long-acting forms, a beta-agonist may be helpful in preventing exercise-induced asthma. An anticholinergic, such as tiotropium bromide (Spiriva Respimat), which is available for individuals age 6 and older, is another long-term maintenance medication for treating asthma."
Monitoring asthma symptoms,"'An important part of treatment is keeping track of how well the lungs are functioning. Asthma symptoms are monitored using a peak flow meter. The meter can alert you to changes in the airways that may be a sign of worsening asthma. By taking daily peak flow readings, you can learn when to adjust medications to keep asthma under good control. Your doctor can also use this information to adjust your treatment plan.' "
Asthma action plan,"'Based on your history and the severity of your asthma, your doctor will develop a care plan called an asthma action plan. The asthma action plan describes when and how to use asthma medications, actions to take when asthma worsens, and when to seek care for an asthma emergency. Make sure you understand this plan; if not, ask your asthma care provider any questions you may have.''WebMD Medical Reference''Reviewed by William Blahd, MD on July 20, 2016''© 2017 WebMD, LLC.

Unusual symptoms of asthma,"'Patients suffering from episodes of asthma do not always have the typical symptoms of asthma such as ''shortness of breath'', chest tightness, and ''wheezing'' (symptoms of ''airway'' narrowing). Instead, patients can have symptoms that may not appear to be related to asthma. These ""unusual"" ''asthma symptoms'' include''To complicate matters, symptoms of asthma are not consistent and often vary from time to time in an individual. In some patients, symptoms are influenced by diurnal factors; for example, some patients experience asthma primarily at night (''nocturnal'' asthma) rather than during the day. Furthermore, episodes of asthma can be triggered by many different factors such as allergens, dust, smoke, perfumes, cold air, exercise, infections, medications, and ''acid reflux''. Finally, other illness such as ''heart'' failure, ''bronchitis'', and dysfunction of the vocal cords can cause symptoms that mimic those of asthma. For these reasons, accurately diagnosing and treating asthma can be a challenge.''For a comprehensive review of symptoms, causes, and treatments of asthma, and for a better understanding of the normal anatomy of the airways (trachea, bronchi, ''bronchioles'' and the lung), please visit the asthma article.'  rapid breathing, sighing, fatigue and inability to exercise properly, difficulty sleeping, anxiety and difficulty concentrating, chronic cough without wheezing, protracted cough after an upper respiratory illness, recurrent diagnosis of walking pneumonia, and noises emanating from the chest usually during exhalation."
Can a cough without wheezing be due to asthma?,"'Chronic ''coughing'' is frequently defined as a cough that lasts longer than three weeks. Chronic cough can have several causes such as ''postnasal drip'', ''pneumonia'', ''bronchitis'', ''cigarette smoking'', acid reflux, ''heart disease'', tumors in the lung (benign or ''malignant''), foreign body aspiration, and medications such as ''ACE inhibitors'' used for treating ''high blood pressure''. Asthma also can cause chronic cough.''A chronic cough may be the only symptom of asthma. The cough may first appear after a cold or an ''upper respiratory tract infection''. The cough may also start as a ""tickle"" in the throat. In some patients with asthma, laughing or exercise can bring on coughing. Other patients tend to cough at night while others cough at any time of day without provocation. It is very important that anyone with an undiagnosed chronic cough receive a chest radiograph to exclude more serious disease.''Coughing due to asthma may not respond to cough suppressants, antibiotics, or cough drops but only to ''medications for asthma''. Therefore, accurately diagnosing asthma (by using pulmonary function tests) is important. Thus, a doctor, preferably a lung specialist or an allergist, should evaluate any cough that does not resolve on its own within three to six weeks.' "
Nocturnal asthma,"'More than 90% of patients with asthma experience nighttime wheezing and coughing. Symptoms of asthma are most common between midnight and 8 a.m. and are important causes of ''insomnia'' and ''sleep'' deprivation among patients with asthma. In fact, ''sleep'' disturbances in patients with asthma usually mean that there is inadequate control of the asthma and should prompt a visit to the doctor to re-evaluate the treatment being used for the asthma.''Function of the ''lungs'' in a patient with asthma can decline by up to 50% during an episode of nocturnal asthma. The reasons are not clear, but possible explanations include:''It is possible to test for nocturnal asthma by taking measurements of airflow out of the lungs during expiration in the evening and again upon awakening in the morning. This is done with a small portable meter that measures the flow of air. (An asthma specialist can demonstrate the correct technique for making these measurements.) A greater than 20% decrease in the peak flow measurement from the evening to the morning suggests nocturnal asthma.' exposure to allergens at night such as dust mites or animal dander; a decrease in cortisone and adrenaline levels that normally occurs at night, resulting in increased reactivity of the airways; reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus; cooling of the airways that cause spasm of the major airways; aspiration into the airways; sinusitis and postnasal drip; and sleep apnea."
Masqueraders of asthma,"'""All that wheezes is not asthma."" Other medical conditions can mimic asthma and make the correct diagnosis of asthma more difficult.' "
Cardiac asthma,"'Cardiac asthma usually occurs in elderly people who have wheezing and shortness of breath that are due to heart failure. When the heart is too weak to pump blood effectively, fluid will accumulate in the lungs. ''Fluid in the lungs'' causes shortness of breath and wheezing. A ''chest X-ray'' can be helpful in diagnosing heart failure by demonstrating an ''enlarged heart'' (usually a sign of heart failure) along with fluid in the tissues of the lung. Lung function testing can sometimes help to distinguish between these problems. In heart failure, ''spirometry'' can be reduced uniformly, so called restriction. In asthma, generally, airflow is obstructed and the volume of air exhaled in the first second of the test is reduced when compared with the total forced exhaled volume. Treatment of heart failure involves using diuretics (water pills) to rid the lungs of excess fluid and medications to help the heart muscle pump more effectively. When the heart failure has been adequately controlled, the wheezing will cease. Some people may suffer from asthma and heart failure simultaneously. These patients require treatment for both conditions.' "
Other bronchial conditions,"'Acute bronchitis''. Acute bronchitis is an infection, usually viral or bacterial, of the bronchi, the larger airways or breathing tubes. The symptoms of acute bronchitis include ''fever'', cough, yellow or green sputum, and, sometimes, wheezing. This combination of coughing and wheezing is sometimes referred to as ""''asthmatic'' bronchitis"" or post-viral bronchial hyperreactivity of the airways. Acute bronchitis is generally treated with antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatory medications such as ''corticosteroids''. The coughing and wheezing usually subside within a few weeks. Some patients with asthma can produce green ''mucus'' that may not reflect an ongoing infection but the consequence of airway inflammation or ''allergic'' response. Generally, in an infectious processes, inflammatory white cells known as neutrophils are activated to fight off this invader. Whereas, the particular inflammatory white cells of asthma tend to be eosinophils, which work mainly on the allergic pathways. Both of these inflammatory cell types can cause the mucus to be yellow to green in color.''Chronic bronchitis''. Chronic bronchitis is usually defined as a daily cough with production of sputum for three months for two years in a row. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is ''cigarette smoking''. With chronic bronchitis, there is longstanding inflammation and swelling of the inner lining of the airways, which cause narrowing of the airways. The inflammation also stimulates production of mucous within the airways that becomes the sputum produced by coughing. Infections of the airways with ''viruses'' or bacteria are common among individuals with chronic bronchitis. Infections further aggravate the inflammation and narrowing of the airways, worsening the symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. Treatments include antibiotics, quitting ''cigarette smoking'', bronchodilators to expand the airways, and corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation.''Emphysema''. Emphysema is a disease where there is permanent destruction of the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) and the small airways (bronchioles). The destruction of the alveolar walls reduces the elasticity of the lung. Loss of elasticity leads to the collapse of the bronchioles, obstructing airflow out of the alveoli. Air becomes ""trapped"" in the alveoli. Air trapped in the alveoli cannot be exchanged for room air, and this reduces the ability of the lung to get rid of carbon dioxide and take in oxygen. Emphysema is most often caused by years of ''cigarette'' ''smoking''; however, a ''genetic disease'', ''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'', also causes emphysema.''Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') is a category of lung diseases that include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, and chronic asthma (asthma in which lung function does not return to normal after an attack). These diseases usually occur in varying combinations, hence the need for an overall category. The major symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. Patients with emphysema also may wheeze if they also suffer from chronic bronchitis and/or asthma. Treatment of these latter patients begins with ''smoking cessation'' and the use of inhalers to deliver bronchodilators and corticosteroids to the lungs. Antibiotics, oxygen, and surgery in the advanced stages of these diseases also can be helpful.''Bronchiectasis''. Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition in which the bronchial tubes (larger airways) are damaged by repeated bronchial infections. The major symptom of bronchiectasis is a persistent cough with thick and usually green mucus. Bronchiectasis is treated with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and corticosteroids when flare-ups occur.''Cystic fibrosis'' is an ''inherited'' condition in which the affected patients can produce thick mucus that plugs the bronchial tubes. The plugging of the bronchial tubes causes repeated bouts of bronchitis and ''pneumonia'', leading to the development of bronchiectasis.''Localized bronchial obstruction'"". Wheezing and coughing can be symptoms of a localized obstruction of the airways (the bronchial tubes or trachea). The wheezing represents the sound of air rushing around the blockage, and the coughing is the body's effort to clear the blockage. The most common causes of localized airway obstruction are foreign bodies such as accidentally inhaled peanuts, bronchial tumors, and the narrowing of the trachea that occurs after a ""'tracheostomy''. The wheezing and coughing due to a localized obstruction will not respond to medications for asthma. The treatment is to relieve the obstruction.' "
Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD),"'Vocal cord dysfunction is an episodic condition involving sudden closure of the voice box (larynx) as a result of the two vocal cords sticking together. This can be physiologic, that is the vocal cords are not working properly due to dysfunctional nerves or structural abnormality. This condition usually requires involvement of ENT physician and often will not correct itself spontaneously.''It can also be caused by paradoxical vocal cord movement, factitious asthma, spastic dysphonia, and globus hystericus. The symptoms of vocal-cord dysfunction are the sudden onset of difficulty breathing and talking, and panic. This can result in a high pitched inspiratory sound, referred to as stridor. Vocal cord dysfunction often is misdiagnosed and treated as asthma because both conditions may have symptoms of wheezing; however, with vocal-cord dysfunction, wheezing usually occurs during inspiration (breathing in), while with asthma, wheezing occurs during expiration (breathing out). Medications used for treating asthma are not effective for treating vocal-cord dysfunction.''Since a correct diagnosis of vocal-cord dysfunction can be difficult, affected people may have repeated episodes that are inappropriately treated as attacks of asthma. The diagnosis often requires a careful, direct inspection of the vocal cords, typically by an ear, nose, and throat specialist. The attacks of vocal-cord dysfunction when psychological usually resolve spontaneously (on their own). Sometimes these cases can present quite dramatically, and raise concerns about potential respiratory arrest. Occasionally , a tracheotomy tube is inserted because of concerns of a true physiologic abnormality. Vocal-cord dysfunction often is associated with acute panic or ''anxiety'' attacks that require antianxiety medications, speech therapy, and ''psychotherapy'' in order to prevent episodes.' "
Other hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions,"'Inhaled ''mold'' spores and particles from bird droppings and feathers (such as from parrots) can cause hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions in the bronchial tubes and the lungs. For example, when ''Aspergillus'' fungal spores cause an ''allergic reaction'' in the bronchial tubes, the condition is called allergic ''bronchopulmonary'' ''aspergillosis''. Affected individuals have both asthma and bronchiectasis which require treatment with both bronchodilators and corticosteroids over a prolonged period of time. Sometimes antifungal therapy is used, as well. When the lung tissues develop an allergic reaction to inhaled bacteria, fungi, or bird particles, the condition is called ''hypersensitivity pneumonitis'' (HP). HP is differentiated from acute asthma by the lack of wheezing, the presence of a ''fever'', and the pattern of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. HP is treated by avoiding the allergens and administering corticosteroids.' "
Exercise and sports,"'Sports and asthma are not mutually exclusive. In the 1996 Olympic Games, one out of every six athletes had asthma. These Olympians competed in a variety of sports such as track and field, mountain biking, kayaking, ''cycling'', and rowing. The following is an abbreviated list of athletes who have competed despite their asthma.' Jackie Joyner-Kersee -- track and field Jerome Bettis -- NFL running back Amy Van Dyken -- swimming Dennis Rodman -- NBA basketball Ray Bourque -- NHL ice hockey"
Exercise-induced asthma (EIA),"'Exercise is a common trigger for asthma and may cause symptoms such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing in 80%-90% of patients with asthma. The symptoms usually start about 10 minutes into the exercise or five to 10 minutes after completing the activity, although some people experience symptoms about four to eight hours after exercise. Although ''exercise-induced asthma'' may affect all ages, it is most common in children and young adults. All athletes, from weekend warriors to professionals and Olympians, can be affected.''This common occurrence of exercise-induced asthma among individuals with asthma has led to the misconception that asthmatic patients cannot exercise. As a result, children with asthma often stay in the library or homeroom while the rest of the class is in the gym. Adult asthma patients may attribute their breathing difficulties during exercise to being ""out of shape"" and hence curtail their level of exercise. For most asthma patients, however, exercise-induced asthma is treatable and preventable, thereby allowing children and adults with asthma to fully participate in sports and exercise. Regular exercise is beneficial for the heart, circulatory system, muscles (including breathing muscles), and ''mental health'', but it will not cure the asthma.'""Exercise-induced asthma is diagnosed by a pattern of asthmatic symptoms prompted by exercise. When the diagnosis is unclear, it can be confirmed in a doctor's office by performing breathing tests at rest and after exercise.""  "
What causes exercise-induced asthma?,"'Environmental allergens, pollutants, or irritants inhaled during exercise may help trigger the symptoms. Prolonged, strenuous exercises without rest periods and exercising in cool, dry conditions can also bring on exercise-induced asthma. There are two theories to explain why this occurs.' Rapid breathing during exercise does not allow inspired air to be warmed and humidified by the nose. This cold, dry air cools the bronchial tubes, causing the muscles around the bronchial tubes to constrict (producing bronchospasm). After exercise, the bronchial tubes warm up. In asthma patients, warming up of the bronchial tubes causes the bronchial tubes to swell and become inflamed. This might explain why asthma occurs after exercise. This may be similar to what happens when previously cold fingers are warmed and they become red and swollen. The second theory involves the loss of humidity surrounding the cells lining the bronchial tubes during rapid breathing. This drying induces the mast cells (cells that contain chemicals that can trigger asthma and other allergic reactions) to release their chemicals, causing bronchospasm and inflammation."
What sports are best suited for exercise induced asthma? What sports are not?,"'Swimming is one of the best exercises for those with exercise-induced asthma. Breathing the usually warm, humid air prevents cooling and drying of the airways. Sports that involve short bursts of exertion interspersed with rest periods are preferable. Tennis, golf, baseball, and volleyball are among the sports meeting this description. The resting periods allow the airways to recover, which usually prevents the onset of exercise-induced asthma.''Rapid breathing of cold, dry air is a potent stimulus of bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, outdoor winter sports, such as skiing, may be the most problematic. It is best to choose a sport that does not require continuous vigorous outdoor exercise such as running, bicycling, or cross-country skiing.' "
Ways to prevent and treat exercise-induced asthma," Choose an appropriate sport. Make sure that your asthma is under good control before you begin exercising. Refrain from exercise and consult your doctor if your asthma is poorly controlled. Warm up for at least 10 minutes prior to exercise. This takes advantage of a ""window of safety"" which may last up to an hour, often preventing exercise-induced asthma. Avoid exercising in cold, dry air and on smoggy days. Covering the mouth and nose with a scarf in cold weather can be helpful. If asthma symptoms occur during exercise, stop immediately and rest. Do not attempt to ""run through"" the symptoms. If your breathing difficulty continues, use an inhaled bronchodilator. Following completion of exercise, do ""cool down"" exercises for 10 minutes to allow the bronchial tubes to re-warm slowly. Preventative use of inhalers that contain cromolyn sodium (Intal) or bronchodilators, such as albuterol (Ventolin, Proventil), 15 to 20 minutes before exercise is usually effective. The leukotriene modifiers, montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate), taken daily in pill form have been found to help prevent exercise-induced asthma in some athletes."
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"'GERD'' is a common condition caused by the regurgitation (reflux) or backwash of stomach acid into the esophagus from the stomach. At times, the acid even may regurgitate into the back of the throat and reach the lungs. GERD ''usually -- but'' not ''always -- is'' associated with a burning discomfort under the breastbone, called ''heartburn'', which occurs mostly after meals or when lying down. In some patients, the symptom of acid reflux is not heartburn. Instead, they experience coughing, wheezing, ''hoarseness'', or ''sore throat''.''The presence of acid in the esophagus or the passage of acid into the lungs (aspiration) may cause the bronchial tubes to constrict (bronchospasm), causing wheezing and coughing that may not respond to medications for asthma. Bronchospasm related to acid reflux tends to occur more frequently at night as a result of lying down. GERD is common among patients with asthma. Some doctors believe that asthma itself or asthma treatments in some way make asthma patients more susceptible to acid reflux. For example, ''theophylline'', an oral medication occasionally used to treat asthma, may promote acid reflux by relaxing the specialized muscles in the esophagus that normally tighten to prevent regurgitation of acid.''In patients with nocturnal or difficult-to-control asthma, treating acid reflux may help relieve coughing and wheezing. Treatment of GERD involves elevating the head of the bed, losing weight, avoiding spicy food, ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', ''chocolate'' and cigarettes. Proton-pump inhibitors such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), ''pantoprazole'' (''Protonix''), ''rabeprazole'' (''Aciphex''), ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''), and ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium'') are potent inhibitors of production of acid in the stomach and are effective treatments for asthma aggravated or caused by acid reflux. Histamine blockers such as ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') and ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid'') are also used. Rarely, surgery is performed to prevent acid reflux for severe cases of GERD that do not respond to medications.'  "
The allergic rhinitis-asthma connection,"'There is a clear association between allergic ''rhinitis'' (''hay fever'') and asthma. The question of which comes ''first -- the'' allergic rhinitis or the ''asthma -- is'' not easily answered. Many patients recall developing their asthma and nasal symptoms at or about the same time. Others developed their asthma either before or after the onset of their allergic rhinitis. We now know that almost all patients with allergic asthma also have allergic rhinitis. Additionally, roughly one-third of people with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma. Patients with both conditions can expect to suffer more severe asthmatic attacks and require stronger medications to treat their asthma. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be vigilant about reporting any persistent coughing or wheezing to their doctors. The presence of asthma can easily be determined with pulmonary function tests.''The following are possible reasons why allergic rhinitis and asthma are related:' The nasal and bronchial membranes are made up of almost the same type of tissue. The nerves of the upper airway (nasal cavity) and the lower airway (bronchial tubes) are connected. Both the upper and lower airways are exposed to the same external environment during breathing. When allergens reach the nasal cavity, there is stimulation of nerve endings in the nasal cavity. This stimulation causes reflex neural signals to be sent to the tissues of both the nasal cavity and the lower airways. In the nasal cavity, these signals cause accumulation of fluid and the formation of mucus, while in the bronchial tubes they cause bronchial constriction and possibly acute asthma. This is sometimes referred to as the naso-bronchial reflex. Nasal congestion causes mouth breathing. During mouth breathing, air bypasses the nose. It is not filtered for allergens and irritating particles, and it is not warmed or humidified. This non-conditioned air is more likely to cause bronchial hyperreactivity and produce asthma symptoms. Mucus from the nasal cavity may drip from the back of the nose into the bronchial tubes, especially during sleep. This dripping mucus increases bronchial inflammation and causes episodes of asthma at night."
Sinusitis and asthma,"'Over the years, physicians have noted an association between asthma and sinusitis. In fact, 15% of patients with sinusitis also have asthma (as opposed to 5% of the normal population). An astounding 75% of severely asthmatic patients also have sinusitis. Additionally, asthmatic patients often report that their symptoms worsen when they develop sinusitis. Conversely, when the sinusitis is treated, the asthma improves.''The reasons behind the association of asthma and sinusitis are similar to those suggested for the association between asthma and allergic rhinitis.''Greater insight into how these two conditions are related may allow better control or even cure of these common conditions.' The infected mucus from the sinuses may drain into the bronchial tubes, thereby causing bronchitis (sinobronchitis). The inflammation caused by the mucus may worsen asthma. The best evidence to date seems to support the idea of neural reflexes in the linings of the nose, sinuses, and airways. Sinusitis may activate a ""sinobronchial reflex"" and worsen asthma."
Air pollution,"'Poor air quality is known to worsen asthma symptoms and increase exacerbations. Diesel emissions are associated with asthma and increased symptoms. Living closer to freeways may result in more frequent exacerbations. Patients with asthma are at increased risk for symptoms when smog, soot, or ozone levels are significantly elevated. Children with smaller body size and developing lungs are at increased risk for breathing problems. ''Indoor air pollution'' may also be a contributing factor. In the third world, indoor fires used for cooking are often associated with respiratory illness. In the industrialized world, formaldehyde, tobacco smoke, dust mites, and other particles can worsen asthma.''Air filters are suggested by some to help minimize their effects on asthmatic patients. Research studies would suggest that maintaining adequate ventilation and modifying the household (removing carpets and drapes, using hypoallergenic mattress covers) may be enough. Some air-filtration systems may reduce some secondhand tobacco smoke, but no system can remove all the harmful components from this smoke. There are no standards for air filtration approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It does rate some portable air-filtration systems as Class II medical devices, indicating safety and medical benefit. If one of the devices is being considered for personal use, it is important to check that the device has this Class II approval. There are several different types of air filters. Mechanical filters force air through a mesh trapping particles. HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) are mechanical filters that capture at least 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or larger. Electronic filters use electrical charges to attract and deposit allergens and irritants on collecting plates. There are also hybrid systems that contain both mechanical and electronic filters. All of these can produce some ozone but usually at acceptable levels. ''Gas'' phase filters can remove odors and gasses such as cooking gas, fumes from paints and building materials, and perfume. They do not remove any allergenic particles. Ozone generators are ozone producers. This gives the ""smell of clean air."" Unfortunately, the ozone levels produced are often higher than acceptable levels. These devices are not recommended.' "
Food allergy,"'Food intolerance is very common but is not ''food allergy'' since it does not involve the immune system. Often this can present with abdominal discomfort after eating the certain food. ''Lactose intolerance'' is a classic example and occurs when dairy products are eaten and the individual does not have the proper digestive enzyme for these diary products. ''Food allergy'"" on the other hand involves the immune system and the production of specific antibodies to components of the food. These antibodies are usually of a specific type called immunoglobulin E (IgE). The most common food allergens are the proteins in cow's milk, ""'soy'', fish, shellfish, eggs, and peanuts.''Usually, the symptoms of food ''allergy'' relate to problems with the skin. ''Hives'', which are raised, red, warm and ''itchy'' lesions, can develop suddenly. ''Atopic dermatitis'' (''eczema'') is more chronic and appears as raised, ''itchy'', scaly lesions. Gastrointestinal symptoms can also occur. Severe reactions can occur rarely and result in failure of the respiratory system and/or cardiovascular collapse. This is referred to as ''anaphylaxis''. Asthma, too, can occur following exposure to a food substance to which an individual is allergic. The optimal management of these ''food allergies'' is avoidance of the offending food if possible. When one discovers or suspects that a food ''allergy'' may be present, an evaluation and testing by a professional with expertise in ''allergies'' (allergist, immunologist) is recommended. These professionals will often perform a variety of skin tests and blood tests looking for evidence of IgE antibodies to the suspected offending substance. A food diary involving a detailed record of all substances consumed can be helpful in discovering the offending food. Once discovered, complete avoidance of these foods is recommended.' "
What Is Exercise-Induced Asthma?,"'Like it sounds, ''exercise-induced asthma'' is ''asthma'' that is triggered by vigorous or prolonged ''exercise'' or physical exertion. Most people with chronic ''asthma'' experience ''symptoms of asthma'' during ''exercise''. However, there are many people without chronic ''asthma'' who develop symptoms only during exercise.' "
Why Does Exercise Induce Asthma?,"'During normal ''breathing'', the air we take in is first warmed and moistened by the nasal passages. Because people tend to breathe through their mouths when they exercise, they are inhaling colder and drier air.''In exercise-induced asthma, the muscle bands around the airways are sensitive to these changes in temperature and humidity and react by contracting, which narrows the ''airway''. This results in symptoms of exercised-induced asthma, which include:''The symptoms of exercise-induced asthma generally begin within 5-20 minutes after the start of exercise, or 5-10 minutes after brief exercise has stopped. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms with exercise, inform your doctor.'  Coughing with asthma Tightening of the chest Wheezing Unusual fatigue while exercising Shortness of breath when exercising"
"If I Have Asthma, Should I Avoid Exercise?","""No. You shouldn't avoid physical activity because of exercise-induced asthma. There are steps you can take for ""'prevention'' of ''asthma symptoms'' that will allow you to maintain normal physical activity. In fact, many athletes -- even Olympic athletes -- compete with asthma. For example, in the 1996 Olympic Games, 1 out of every 6 athletes had asthma. These Olympians competed in a variety of sports such as track and field, mountain biking, kayaking, ''cycling'', and rowing. The following is an abbreviated list of athletes who have competed despite their asthma.' Jackie Joyner-Kersee - track and field Jerome Bettis - NFL running back Amy Van Dyken - swimming Dennis Rodman - NBA basketball Ray Bourque - NHL hockey"
Can My Exercise-Induced Asthma Be Prevented?,"'Yes. Asthma inhalers or ''bronchodilators'' used prior to exercise can control and prevent exercise-induced asthma symptoms. The preferred ''asthma medications'' are short-acting beta-2 agonists such as ''albuterol''. Taken 15-20 minutes before exercise, these medications can prevent the airways from contracting and control exercise-induced asthma for as long as 4-6 hours.''Other asthma treatments that may be useful are the long-acting beta-2 agonists, such as ''Serevent'' and ''Foradil'', which provide 12-hour control. When these medications are taken in the morning, exercise-induced asthma symptoms may be avoided with any exercise throughout the day. It is important, however, to always have an asthma inhaler available in case symptoms still occur.''In addition to taking medications, warming up prior to exercising and cooling down after exercise can help in asthma prevention. For those with ''allergies'' and asthma, exercise should be limited during high ''pollen'' days or when temperatures are extremely low and air pollution levels are high. Infections can cause asthma (colds, ''flu'', ''sinusitis'"") and increase asthma symptoms, so it's best to restrict your exercise when you're sick."" "
What Are the Best Exercises for Someone With Asthma?,"'For people with exercise-induced asthma, some activities are better than others. Activities that involve short, intermittent periods of exertion, such as volleyball, gymnastics, baseball, ''walking'', and wrestling, are generally well tolerated by people with exercise-induced asthma.''Activities that involve long periods of exertion, like soccer, distance running, basketball, and field hockey, may be less well tolerated, as are ''cold'' weather sports like ice hockey, cross-country skiing, and ice skating. However, many people with asthma are able to fully participate in these activities.''Swimming, which is a strong endurance sport, is generally well tolerated by asthmatics because it is usually performed in a warm, moist air environment.''Maintaining an active lifestyle, even exercising with asthma, is important for both physical and ''mental health''. You should be able to actively participate in sports and activities.' "
Are There Some Tips to Prevent and Treat Exercise-Induced Asthma?,"'Again, asthma should not be used as an excuse to avoid exercise. With proper diagnosis and treatment of asthma, you should be able to enjoy the benefits of an exercise program without experiencing asthma symptoms.''SOURCES: American Academy of ''Allergy'' Asthma & Immunology: ""''Allergic'' Conditions: Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)."" American Lung Association: ""Search LungUSA.""''Reviewed by Jonathan L. Gelfand, MD, on July 20, 2008''Portions of this page © Cleveland Clinic 2008'  Always use your pre-exercise inhaled medicines before beginning exercise. Perform warm-up exercises and maintain an appropriate cool down period after exercise. If the weather is cold, exercise indoors or wear a mask or scarf over your nose and mouth. Avoid exercising outdoors when pollen counts are high (if you have allergies), and also avoid exercising outdoors when there is high air pollution. Restrict exercise when you have a viral infection. Exercise at a level that is appropriate for you."
What is asthma in children?,"'Asthma'' is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, characterized by recurrent, reversible, ''airway'' obstruction. Airway inflammation leads to airway hyperreactivity, which causes the airways to narrow in response to various stimuli, including allergens, ''exercise'', and ''cold'' air. ' "
How common is asthma in children?,"'Asthma'' is the most common chronic disease of childhood. The prevalence of ''asthma'' is increasing. This is also the case with other ''allergy'' conditions, including ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis''), ''hay fever'' (''allergic rhinitis''), and ''food allergies''. According to recent CDC data, asthma affects approximately 8.5% of the pediatric population in the U.S., or more than 7 million children. Asthma accounts for more school absences and more hospitalizations than any other chronic condition in this country. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of asthma in children?,"'The most common symptoms of childhood asthma are ''coughing'' and ''wheezing''.''Other common symptoms include:''Symptoms are often worse with exertion or during the night. Night ''cough'' is also common. Symptoms are also typically exacerbated by viral upper respiratory infections, and these viral symptoms can linger for weeks in children with asthma, whereas age-controlled counterparts tend to recover much sooner. Symptoms can also have a seasonal variation, which can be due to environmental ''allergies''. Tobacco smoke commonly aggravates symptoms, and secondhand tobacco smoke is not only a risk factor for developing childhood asthma, but also complicates asthma control. Children with asthma often have a history of recurrent ''bronchitis'' or even a recurrent ''croup''-like cough.''The physical exam in asthma is often completely normal. Occasionally, wheezing is present. In an asthma exacerbation, the respiratory rate increases, the ''heart'' rate increases, and children can look as if breathing is much more difficult. They may require accessory muscles to breath, and retractions of the chest wall adjacent to the ribs are common. Younger children may become lethargic and less interested in feeding. It is important to note that blood oxygen levels typically remain fairly normal even in the midst of a significant asthma exacerbation.'   Coughing is typically non-productive and can frequently be the only symptom. When it is the only symptom, this is termed cough-variant asthma. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound produced by turbulent airflow through narrowed airways. Difficulty breathing Chest tightness Poor exercise endurance"
How is asthma in children diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of asthma in children is often a purely clinical diagnosis. A typical history is a child with a family history of asthma and ''allergies'' who experiences coughing and difficulty breathing when playing with friends and/or who experiences frequent bouts of ''bronchitis'' or prolonged respiratory infections. Improvement with a trial of ''asthma medications'' essentially confirms the diagnosis of asthma.''If the child is old enough, they may undergo testing to aid in the diagnosis of asthma. ''Spirometry'' is a breathing test to measure lung function and children can generally start performing proper technique for this testing around 5 years of age. Another test is exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which is a marker for airway inflammation, and this test may also be performed starting around 5 years of age. In younger children who cannot perform proper technique for lung function testing, impulse oscillometry is used to measure airway resistance. It should be noted, however, that this is a fairly involved test and it is rarely ordered in the diagnosis of pediatric asthma. The vast majority of younger children are diagnosed based on history alone.''Other objective measures to help in the diagnosis of pediatric asthma include using a peak flow meter, which can help to estimate lung function. Sometimes, testing for airway hyperresponsiveness (methacholine or ''mannitol'' challenge) can help diagnosis asthma, again in older children capable of performing proper technique. Chest ''X-rays'' can sometimes be helpful to aid in the diagnosis of asthma. They may show hyperinflation, but are often completely normal.''Allergy'"" testing can also be helpful in diagnosis, since the risk of asthma is higher in children with sensitizations to common environmental aeroallergens. It is very important to recognize that a child can have poorly-controlled asthma despite completely normal lung function. Therefore, normal lung function does not preclude the diagnosis of asthma if a physician's clinical suspicion is high. "" "
What is the treatment for asthma in children?,"'The goals for the treatment of asthma in children are to''Inhaled ''corticosteroids'' (cortisone medication) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the chronic treatment of asthma and are generally first-line therapy per most asthma guidelines. It is well recognized that inhaled corticosteroids are very effective in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting ''bronchodilator'' and an inhaled ''corticosteroid'' has a significant additional beneficial effect on improving asthma control. ''A complete list of commonly used asthma medications is as follows:''There is often concern about potential long-term side effects for even inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few if any sustained clinically significant side effects, including growth in children. However, the goal always remains to treat children (and adults) with the least amount of medication that is effective.''Asthma medications can be administered via nebulized solution, which requires no technique and is very helpful in young children (often under 5 years of age). Around 5 years of age, children can transition to inhalers either with or without an aerochamber and/or a mask. It is important to note that if an individual has proper technique with an inhaler, the amount of medication deposition in the ''lungs'' is no different than with using a nebulized solution. When prescribing asthma medications, it is essential to provide the proper teaching on proper delivery technique.''Although the vast majority of children with asthma are treated as outpatients, treatment of severe exacerbations can require management in the emergency department or inpatient hospitalization. These children typically require use of supplemental oxygen, early administration of systemic steroids, and frequent or even continuous administration of bronchodilators via a nebulized solution. Children at high risk for poor asthma outcomes should be referred to a specialist (''pulmonologist'' or allergist). Children with the following factors may be at high risk:'  adequately control symptoms; minimize the risk of future exacerbations; maintain normal lung function; maintain normal activity levels; and use the least amount of medication possible with the least amount of potential side effects. Short-acting bronchodilators provide quick relief and are used for exercise-induced symptoms (for example, albuterol [Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, Maxair, Xopenex]). Inhaled steroids are first-line anti-inflammatory therapy (for example, budesonide, 
            fluticasone, beclomethasone, mometasone, ciclesonide). Long-acting bronchodilators can be added to inhaled corticosteroids as additive 
            therapy (for example, salmeterol, formoterol). Leukotriene modifiers can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents (for example, 
            montelukast, zafirlukast). Anticholinergic agents can help decrease sputum production (for example,  
ipratropium, tiotropium). Anti-IgE therapy can be used in adolescents with allergic asthma (for example, omalizumab). Chromones stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice
   (for example, cromolyn, nedocromil). Theophylline also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways) but again is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side effect profile. Systemic steroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically (for example, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisone, dexamethasone). Numerous other monoclonal antibodies are being currently studied but none are currently commercially available for routine therapy of asthma. History of ICU admission or multiple hospitalizations for asthma History of multiple visits to the emergency department for asthma History of frequent use of systemic steroids for asthma Ongoing symptoms despite the use of appropriate medications Significant allergies contributing to poorly-controlled asthma"
What is the prognosis for asthma in children?,"'The prognosis is best in young children who wheeze with viral respiratory infections and who have no symptoms in between these episodes. It can often be difficult to differentiate these “early wheezers” from children with true asthma. Children with recurrent symptoms tend to have ongoing asthma later in life.  Boys “outgrow” asthma more often than girls, and a child with no evidence of environmental allergies has a better chance of “outgrowing” asthma as compared to a child with concurrent allergic disease (hay ''fever''). Even in children with ongoing asthma, prognosis is excellent for those with preserved activity level and lung function through the use of appropriate medications. ' "
Can asthma in children be prevented?,"'With the increasing prevalence of asthma, numerous studies have looked at risk factors and ways to potentially prevent asthma. It has been shown that children living on farms are protected against wheezing, asthma, and even environmental allergies. The role of air pollution has been questioned in both the increased incidence of asthma and in regards to asthma exacerbations. Climate change is also being studied as a factor in the increased incidence of asthma. Maternal ''smoking during pregnancy'' is a risk factor for asthma and poor outcomes. Secondhand tobacco smoke is also a significant risk factor for development and progression of asthma. Up to 50% of children who experience significant ''respiratory syncytial virus'"" (RSV) infection are eventually diagnosed with asthma. Evidence suggests that the risk of asthma is reduced in children with a history of certain infections, rural living, exposure to other children (including older siblings), and less frequent use of antibiotics. The development of asthma is ultimately a complicated process influenced by many environmental and genetic factors, and therefore there is no proven way to decrease a child's risk of developing asthma. "" "
Who is a candidate for asthma medication?,"'Any patient who has a diagnosis of ''asthma'' is a candidate for an ''asthma'' medication. Patients with mild, infrequent ''asthma symptoms'' may only need a short-acting rescue medication to use when needed, such as ''albuterol'' (''Ventolin HFA'', ''Proventil-HFA'', ''Vospire'' ER, ''ProAir HFA'', ProAir, RespiClick). Patients with more frequent and persistent ''asthma'' symptoms are candidates for daily medications. The choice of medication will depend on the severity of the asthma.' "
What are controller medications for asthma (long-term control)?,"'A controller medication is a daily medication that is used to prevent or improve asthma symptoms in patients who experience frequent symptoms. The decision to use a controller medication for a patient with asthma is based on the frequency and type of daytime or nighttime symptoms, frequency of medical visits for asthma, frequency of requiring asthma rescue medications, frequency of oral steroid use, impact of asthma symptoms on daily life, and ''breathing'' tests for asthma, which are performed in the medical office. In patients requiring controller medications, inhaled ''corticosteroids'' are generally considered as the first-line therapy for asthma.' "
What are rescue medications for asthma (short-term control)?,"'A rescue medication for asthma is a medication that works within minutes to open the airways (bronchodilate) and provides quick relief from asthma symptoms, such as ''chest tightness'', ''shortness of breath'', ''cough'', or ''wheezing''. The rescue medications for asthma include albuterol, levalbuterol (''Xopenex''), and ipratropium (''Atrovent''). Of these, albuterol is by far the most commonly prescribed rescue medication for asthma. Levalbuterol is the chemical mirror image of albuterol and may have less potential to make patients restless or jittery. Ipratropium has shown to be helpful when used along with albuterol in patients requiring emergency treatment for asthma. It also may be used in patients who are unable to tolerate albuterol or levalbuterol.' "
"What are the different forms of medications (pills, inhalers, nebulizers) 
to treat asthma?","'Many first-line controller and rescue medications are administered through asthma inhalers. Some of these inhalers are called metered-dose inhalers in which the inhaler itself propels the medication into the ''lungs''. Other inhalers are activated by patients taking a breath, and these are called dry powder inhalers or breath-actuated inhalers. Different types of inhalers may work better for different individuals, but both types of inhalers are effective for asthma symptom control if used correctly.''Nebulizers are machines that allow asthma medications to be delivered in an aerosolized form, and the medications are then inhaled through a mouthpiece or mask. Nebulizers are often used for children who are unable to perform the proper technique required for inhalers. Some asthma medications are also available as pills. There are currently two injectable medications for asthma (''omalizumab'' [''Xolair''] and mepolizumab [Nucala] see below), and these are administered in a health-care setting only. There is also an intravenous medication for asthma (reslizumab [Cinqair]; see below). Within the near future, there will likely be additional asthma medications that can be administered either by injection or intravenously.'  "
What are the specific controller medications for asthma?,"'The first-line controller medications for asthma based on the Expert Panel Report (EPR-3) asthma guidelines from the National ''Heart'', Blood, and Lung Institute (NHLBI) are inhaled corticosteroids. These medications are delivered either through inhaler devices or a nebulizer and help to control inflammation in the lungs due to asthma, thus improving symptoms and decreasing the risk of exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids by both generic and brand names include fluticasone (Flovent and Arnuity Ellipta), ''budesonide'' (Pulmicort), beclomethasone (''Qvar''), ''mometasone'' (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).''Combination controller medications exist for patients whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids alone. These medications have a long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol, ''salmeterol'', or vilanterol, which are medications that helps to open the airways [bronchodilate]), in addition to the inhaled corticosteroids. The combination controller medications include fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), mometasone/formoterol (Dulera), and fluticasone/vilanterol (Breo). These medications are available for delivery by inhaler.''A class of oral medications for asthma is the leukotriene modifiers, which act on an immune pathway in the body (the leukotriene pathway) that is responsible for inflammation. This group of medications includes ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ''zafirlukast'' (''Accolate''), and ''zileuton'' (''Zyflo''). These medications may be used alone in milder asthma but are often used along with inhaled corticosteroids in moderate to severe asthma.''There is a different type of inhaled medication called tiotropium (Spiriva) that may be used for asthma patients, usually together with inhaled corticosteroids. This medication may be indicated for patients who need a combination therapy but who are unable to tolerate the long-acting beta-agonists. This medication also may be appropriate for patients who have a history of asthma but who also have a history of ''smoking''-related lung disease (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''). Tiotropium also may help to further improve symptoms in patients whose asthma is not well controlled on a combination inhaled ''corticosteroid''/long-acting beta-agonist medication.''Another oral medication for asthma is called ''theophylline'' (''Respbid'', ''Slo-Bid'', ''Theo-24''). This is an older asthma medication that is not used as frequently today as in the past. This medication acts to open the airways (bronchodilate) and also improves inflammation in the lung due to immune cells activated in asthma. Theophylline is usually used in combination with other asthma medications. Its use is often limited by potential side effects that are not a concern with other asthma medications.''Cromolyn'' is an asthma medication that is only available in the United States for delivery via a nebulizer. Cromolyn is suggested as an alternative medication to inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control, usually in mild asthma. It is not a commonly used asthma medication.''There is also an injectable medication approved for ''allergic'' asthma, called omalizumab (Xolair) or anti-IgE therapy. This medication binds to the antibody type responsible for allergic reactions (immunoglobulin E or IgE) in the bloodstream and is indicated for severe, allergic asthma not controlled with any of the other available asthma medications. This medication must always be administered in a health-care setting.''Recently, two medications have been approved that bind to a chemical messenger in the body, called interleukin 5 (IL-5). Mepolizumab (Nucala) is administered subcutaneously, and reslizumab (Cinqair) is administered intravenously. IL-5 promotes activation and development of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that is known to contribute to asthma in certain patients. These medications are indicated in patients with asthma not controlled by first line medications who also have an elevated eosinophil count in their blood.''Oral steroids, such as ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''), ''prednisolone'' (''Flo-Pred'', ''Pediapred'', ''Orapred'', Orapred ODT), ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol'', ''Depo-Medrol'', ''Solu-Medrol''), and ''dexamethasone'' (DexPak), are often used during asthma flares to provide prompt relief for ''asthmatic'' patients. Although very effective, these medications have many side effects and are only used when absolutely necessary. Some patients with severe asthma, however, may require oral steroids frequently or even on a daily basis.''Numerous new medications are being studied, but none are currently commercially available for routine therapy of asthma.' Short-acting bronchodilators provide quick relief and can be used in conjunction for exercise-induced symptoms. Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, Maxair, Xopenex) is a short-acting bronchodilator. Inhaled steroids are first-line anti-inflammatory therapy. Examples of these medications include budesonide (Pulmicort), fluticasone (Flovent), beclomethasone (Qvar), mometasone (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco). Long-acting bronchodilators can be added to inhaled corticosteroids. These should never be used alone for the treatment of asthma. Salmeterol and formoterol are in this class. Leukotriene modifiers can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents. These medications include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo). Anticholinergic agents can help decrease sputum production. Examples of these medications include ipratropium (Atrovent) and tiotropium (Spiriva). Anti-IgE can be used in moderate to severe allergic asthma. Omalizumab (Xolair) is an anti-IgE medication. Anti-IL-5 agents can be used in moderate to severe asthma with elevated eosinophils. These include mepolizumab (Nucala) and reslizumab (Cinqair). Chromones stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice. Cromolyn and nedocromil (Alocril) are in this drug class. Theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24) also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways) but again is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side effect profile. Oral steroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically. Prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred), prednisolone (Flo-Pred, Pediapred, Orapred, Orapred ODT), methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol), and dexamethasone (DexPak) are medications in this class."
What are over-the-counter (OTC) asthma medications?,'All asthma medications require a prescription since patients with asthma should be followed regularly by a health-care professional. There are currently no OTC asthma medications that are recommended for use in asthma treatment guidelines.' 
What are asthma medication guidelines?,"'The asthma medication guidelines classify asthma into different categories based on asthma symptoms during the day, asthma symptoms during the nighttime, use of rescue medications, impact of asthma on daily life, use of oral steroids, and breathing tests done in medical offices (''spirometry''). The asthma classifications include mild intermittent asthma, mild persistent asthma, moderate persistent asthma, and severe persistent asthma.''Patients classified as having ''mild intermittent asthma'' generally only require short-acting rescue medications. ''Mild persistent asthma'' is treated with inhaled corticosteroids as recommended first-line therapy, with a leukotriene modifier, theophylline, or cromolyn as alternative therapies to the inhaled corticosteroids.''Patients with ''moderate persistent asthma'' are usually treated with an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid, or an inhaled steroid plus a leukotriene modifier or possibly theophylline.''Patients with ''severe persistent asthma'' are treated with the higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids plus the long-acting beta-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, possibly theophylline, possibly tiotropium, and possibly anti-IgE or anti IL-5 therapy. Patients with difficult-to-control asthma often end up on multiple types of medications, and some may require oral steroids to maintain control.'  "
"What are the potential risks and side effects of 
drugs used to treat asthma?","'Common side effects of short-acting asthma medications (albuterol, levalbuterol) are a feeling of jitteriness, ''tremors'', and/or heart ''palpitations''. ''Hyperactivity'' can also occur, particularly in children.''The two most common side effects of inhaled corticosteroids are ''hoarseness'' or ''thrush'', which is an overgrowth of yeast in the mouth. It is therefore recommended that patients using inhaled corticosteroids rinse their mouth after use. These side effects can also be minimized with proper inhaler technique. There is often concern about potential long-term side effects for inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few, if any, sustained significant side effects, including changes in bone health, decreased growth, or ''weight gain''. However, the goal always remains to treat all individuals with the least amount of medication that is effective. Patients with asthma should be routinely reassessed for any appropriate changes to their medical regimen. Although uncommon, the combination asthma medications may also cause ''palpitations'' or a sense of jitteriness due to the long-acting beta-agonists.''Montelukast, the leukotriene modifier medication, may cause ''mood changes'' or ''sleep'' disturbance, particularly in children. Zileuton may cause ''liver'' inflammation, so health-care professionals should periodically monitor ''liver blood tests''.''Omalizumab is generally a well-tolerated medication. Patients may experience some local irritation at the injection site. There is also a warning about the possibility of ''severe allergic reaction'' (''anaphylaxis'') occurring with use of omalizumab. It is recommended that patients on this medication have injectable epinephrine to use in the rare case this occurs. Omalizumab should also always be administered in a health-care facility. Mepolizumab and reslizumab are also generally well-tolerated medications. Patients may experience irritation at the injection or infusion site.''Tiotropium may cause ''dry mouth'' or irritation of the throat. Theophylline may cause a sense of restlessness. It also can interact with other non-asthma medications so its use requires regular monitoring of blood levels.'  "
What are the various kinds of asthma medications for toddlers and children?,"'Short-acting beta-agonists (albuterol and levalbuterol) are used as rescue medications in children and toddlers. These may be used via an inhaler with a spacer and face mask in younger children and via inhaler in older children. These medications are also available in nebulized form, which may be easier to use in infants and toddlers.''Inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay for daily controller medications in children and toddlers. The choice of which inhaled corticosteroid often comes down to which medication delivery device is preferred by caretakers. Young children can use metered-dose inhalers with a spacer and face mask, as long as caregivers are trained and feel comfortable with the proper technique. Budesonide is available via nebulizer, and this may be easier for infants and younger toddlers. Some children may also feel comfortable with a dry powder inhaler. If used properly, all medication delivery devices are effective, so choice is usually individualized based on ''caregiver'' and child preference. Combination inhalers are also used in children, and health-care professionals caring for children with asthma may choose these for children with moderate to severe asthma.''The leukotriene modifier medications are also used in children. Montelukast is available in granules that can be sprinkled on food and is approved for infants as young as 6 months of age. It is also available in chewable form. Zafirlukast is available for children 5 years old and up. Zileuton is recommended for children 12 years old and up.''Omalizumab may be used in children 6 years old and up with poorly controlled asthma and evidence of allergic sensitization.' "
What kinds of asthma medications are safe to use in pregnancy?,"'About one-third of ''pregnant'' women with asthma experience improvement of the condition during ''pregnancy'', one-third have worsening of asthma symptoms during pregnancy, and one-third stay the same, so asthma control and resulting asthma medication use during pregnancy should be closely monitored. It is generally accepted that the risk of uncontrolled asthma in pregnancy carries more of a risk to the mother and fetus than the use of any of the asthma medications. Therefore, any of the asthma medications can be used in pregnancy if thought to be appropriate by the health-care professional. Of all the asthma medications, montelukast, zafirlukast, budesonide, cromolyn, and omalizumab have been best studied to be the safest in pregnancy.' "
Who is a candidate for asthma medication?,"'Any patient who has a diagnosis of ''asthma'' is a candidate for an ''asthma'' medication. Patients with mild, infrequent ''asthma symptoms'' may only need a short-acting rescue medication to use when needed, such as ''albuterol'' (''Ventolin HFA'', ''Proventil-HFA'', ''Vospire'' ER, ''ProAir HFA'', ProAir, RespiClick). Patients with more frequent and persistent ''asthma'' symptoms are candidates for daily medications. The choice of medication will depend on the severity of the asthma.' "
What are controller medications for asthma (long-term control)?,"'A controller medication is a daily medication that is used to prevent or improve asthma symptoms in patients who experience frequent symptoms. The decision to use a controller medication for a patient with asthma is based on the frequency and type of daytime or nighttime symptoms, frequency of medical visits for asthma, frequency of requiring asthma rescue medications, frequency of oral steroid use, impact of asthma symptoms on daily life, and ''breathing'' tests for asthma, which are performed in the medical office. In patients requiring controller medications, inhaled ''corticosteroids'' are generally considered as the first-line therapy for asthma.' "
What are rescue medications for asthma (short-term control)?,"'A rescue medication for asthma is a medication that works within minutes to open the airways (bronchodilate) and provides quick relief from asthma symptoms, such as ''chest tightness'', ''shortness of breath'', ''cough'', or ''wheezing''. The rescue medications for asthma include albuterol, levalbuterol (''Xopenex''), and ipratropium (''Atrovent''). Of these, albuterol is by far the most commonly prescribed rescue medication for asthma. Levalbuterol is the chemical mirror image of albuterol and may have less potential to make patients restless or jittery. Ipratropium has shown to be helpful when used along with albuterol in patients requiring emergency treatment for asthma. It also may be used in patients who are unable to tolerate albuterol or levalbuterol.' "
"What are the different forms of medications (pills, inhalers, nebulizers) 
to treat asthma?","'Many first-line controller and rescue medications are administered through asthma inhalers. Some of these inhalers are called metered-dose inhalers in which the inhaler itself propels the medication into the ''lungs''. Other inhalers are activated by patients taking a breath, and these are called dry powder inhalers or breath-actuated inhalers. Different types of inhalers may work better for different individuals, but both types of inhalers are effective for asthma symptom control if used correctly.''Nebulizers are machines that allow asthma medications to be delivered in an aerosolized form, and the medications are then inhaled through a mouthpiece or mask. Nebulizers are often used for children who are unable to perform the proper technique required for inhalers. Some asthma medications are also available as pills. There are currently two injectable medications for asthma (''omalizumab'' [''Xolair''] and mepolizumab [Nucala] see below), and these are administered in a health-care setting only. There is also an intravenous medication for asthma (reslizumab [Cinqair]; see below). Within the near future, there will likely be additional asthma medications that can be administered either by injection or intravenously.'  "
What are the specific controller medications for asthma?,"'The first-line controller medications for asthma based on the Expert Panel Report (EPR-3) asthma guidelines from the National ''Heart'', Blood, and Lung Institute (NHLBI) are inhaled corticosteroids. These medications are delivered either through inhaler devices or a nebulizer and help to control inflammation in the lungs due to asthma, thus improving symptoms and decreasing the risk of exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids by both generic and brand names include fluticasone (Flovent and Arnuity Ellipta), ''budesonide'' (Pulmicort), beclomethasone (''Qvar''), ''mometasone'' (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).''Combination controller medications exist for patients whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids alone. These medications have a long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol, ''salmeterol'', or vilanterol, which are medications that helps to open the airways [bronchodilate]), in addition to the inhaled corticosteroids. The combination controller medications include fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), mometasone/formoterol (Dulera), and fluticasone/vilanterol (Breo). These medications are available for delivery by inhaler.''A class of oral medications for asthma is the leukotriene modifiers, which act on an immune pathway in the body (the leukotriene pathway) that is responsible for inflammation. This group of medications includes ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ''zafirlukast'' (''Accolate''), and ''zileuton'' (''Zyflo''). These medications may be used alone in milder asthma but are often used along with inhaled corticosteroids in moderate to severe asthma.''There is a different type of inhaled medication called tiotropium (Spiriva) that may be used for asthma patients, usually together with inhaled corticosteroids. This medication may be indicated for patients who need a combination therapy but who are unable to tolerate the long-acting beta-agonists. This medication also may be appropriate for patients who have a history of asthma but who also have a history of ''smoking''-related lung disease (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''). Tiotropium also may help to further improve symptoms in patients whose asthma is not well controlled on a combination inhaled ''corticosteroid''/long-acting beta-agonist medication.''Another oral medication for asthma is called ''theophylline'' (''Respbid'', ''Slo-Bid'', ''Theo-24''). This is an older asthma medication that is not used as frequently today as in the past. This medication acts to open the airways (bronchodilate) and also improves inflammation in the lung due to immune cells activated in asthma. Theophylline is usually used in combination with other asthma medications. Its use is often limited by potential side effects that are not a concern with other asthma medications.''Cromolyn'' is an asthma medication that is only available in the United States for delivery via a nebulizer. Cromolyn is suggested as an alternative medication to inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control, usually in mild asthma. It is not a commonly used asthma medication.''There is also an injectable medication approved for ''allergic'' asthma, called omalizumab (Xolair) or anti-IgE therapy. This medication binds to the antibody type responsible for allergic reactions (immunoglobulin E or IgE) in the bloodstream and is indicated for severe, allergic asthma not controlled with any of the other available asthma medications. This medication must always be administered in a health-care setting.''Recently, two medications have been approved that bind to a chemical messenger in the body, called interleukin 5 (IL-5). Mepolizumab (Nucala) is administered subcutaneously, and reslizumab (Cinqair) is administered intravenously. IL-5 promotes activation and development of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that is known to contribute to asthma in certain patients. These medications are indicated in patients with asthma not controlled by first line medications who also have an elevated eosinophil count in their blood.''Oral steroids, such as ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', ''Liquid Pred''), ''prednisolone'' (''Flo-Pred'', ''Pediapred'', ''Orapred'', Orapred ODT), ''methylprednisolone'' (''Medrol'', ''Depo-Medrol'', ''Solu-Medrol''), and ''dexamethasone'' (DexPak), are often used during asthma flares to provide prompt relief for ''asthmatic'' patients. Although very effective, these medications have many side effects and are only used when absolutely necessary. Some patients with severe asthma, however, may require oral steroids frequently or even on a daily basis.''Numerous new medications are being studied, but none are currently commercially available for routine therapy of asthma.' Short-acting bronchodilators provide quick relief and can be used in conjunction for exercise-induced symptoms. Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, Maxair, Xopenex) is a short-acting bronchodilator. Inhaled steroids are first-line anti-inflammatory therapy. Examples of these medications include budesonide (Pulmicort), fluticasone (Flovent), beclomethasone (Qvar), mometasone (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco). Long-acting bronchodilators can be added to inhaled corticosteroids. These should never be used alone for the treatment of asthma. Salmeterol and formoterol are in this class. Leukotriene modifiers can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents. These medications include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo). Anticholinergic agents can help decrease sputum production. Examples of these medications include ipratropium (Atrovent) and tiotropium (Spiriva). Anti-IgE can be used in moderate to severe allergic asthma. Omalizumab (Xolair) is an anti-IgE medication. Anti-IL-5 agents can be used in moderate to severe asthma with elevated eosinophils. These include mepolizumab (Nucala) and reslizumab (Cinqair). Chromones stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice. Cromolyn and nedocromil (Alocril) are in this drug class. Theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24) also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways) but again is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side effect profile. Oral steroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically. Prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred), prednisolone (Flo-Pred, Pediapred, Orapred, Orapred ODT), methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol), and dexamethasone (DexPak) are medications in this class."

Asthma introduction,"'Asthma'' is a disease in which there is a brief, temporary narrowing of the airways in the ''lungs'', referred to as bronchospasm. This is only part of the picture. The main problem in ''asthma'' involves inflammation and swelling of the airways. It is important to understand that the lungs have a series of tubes akin to branches of tree leading to each of the air sacs of the lungs. When these tubes become inflamed, the walls thicken and the opening of the tube narrows. This causes increased resistance for air flow. In addition, these changes make it easier for bronchospasm to occur. Both bronchospasm and thickened ''airway'' walls prevent air from moving in and out of the lungs easily. As a result, a patient with ''asthma'' has episodic difficulty ''breathing''. An ''asthmatic'' episode can resolve spontaneously or may require treatment.''It is crucial to understand that over time the airway inflammation associated with asthma can result in permanent remodeling/scarring of the airways. When this occurs and lung function no longer returns normal when not having an attack, Asthma moves into the category of disease known as ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). Therefore, if persistent symptoms of ''chest tightness'', ''cough'', ''wheezing'', ''shortness of breath'' occur, it is imperative to be evaluated by a physician. Even mild symptoms, if long lasting, can reflect chronic inflammation and progress to ''COPD''. The available ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications treat bronchospasm primarily and have little, if any, effect on airway inflammation. It is not advisable to use over-the-counter asthma medication unless instructed by a physician knowledgeable in the treatment of asthma. Airway inflammation is treated by prescription medications such as ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ''zafirlukast'' (''Accolate''), and inhaled ''corticosteroids'' (steroids).''Asthmatic patients and their physicians may select from a wide variety of prescription medications. This is not true for OTC medicines, which are limited to epinephrine (adrenaline) and ''ephedrine''. In addition, many asthmatic patients should not use epinephrine or ephedrine because of their relatively weak effectiveness or side effects.''To decide whether an OTC epinephrine or ephedrine product may be useful, patients should understand:''The advantages of using OTC ''medications for asthma'' include their affordability and accessibility (lack of need for a prescription and/or health insurance approval). Unfortunately, these medications are less effective at controlling asthma and sometimes can be more dangerous.''Recently, the FDA published safety concerns about the new medication Asthmanefrin and the EZ Breathe atomizer. They report complications such as ''chest pain'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', increased ''blood pressure'', increased ''heart'' rate, and ''coughing up blood''. Even more disconcerting, they have reports of a choking hazard from a washer dislodged during atomizer use.''Most pulmonary and ''allergy'' specialists would discourage the use of these OTC medications unless ''asthma symptoms'' are extremely mild and infrequent.' the abnormal conditions that exist in the airways of asthmatics; the effects of epinephrine and ephedrine; the specific factors that should be considered when choosing and using epinephrine and ephedrine; and the side effects of these drugs."
What is asthma?,"'The cause of asthma is unknown. Physicians know more about the abnormal conditions that occur in asthma. These conditions include:''Each of these conditions narrow the airways and make breathing difficult. Asthma symptoms include wheezing (the hallmark of asthma), ''coughing'', difficulty breathing, and tightness of the chest. Health care professionals diagnose asthma by the presence of wheezing, though wheezing can occur with other diseases, such as airway narrowing from other diseases, or excess fluid from ''congestive heart failure''. Other common symptoms, such as ''cough'' and shortness of breath, help determine if asthma is present. Breathing tests (''spirometry'') that evaluate the movement of air into and out of the lungs can be very helpful in making the diagnosis. Normally, one can exhale 70% of the air from the lungs in one second with a forced ''exhalation''. In asthma, this number is often reduced when a patient is having symptoms. When they are better, the volume of air exhaled in that first second (referred to as FEV1, forced expired volume in one second) often is normal. This reversibility also helps confirm the diagnosis. Often a ''bronchodilator'' is administered after initial testing to determine if the airways dilate, another confirmatory test. Some have a type of asthma referred to as cough variant asthma. In this situation, patients have a cough that is chronic or recurrent with the presence of normal lung function.'   hyper-responsiveness (contraction) of the muscles of the breathing airways in response to many stimuli such as exercise or allergies (for example, drugs, food additives, dust mites, animal fur, and mold); inflammation of the airways; shedding of the tissue lining the airways; increased secretion of mucus in the airways; and swelling of the airways with fluid."
What medications treat asthma?,"'Prior to modern medicine, people smoked a variety of plants and herbs in an effort to treat asthma. Some were mildly efficacious, while others were just plain dangerous. Oral and inhaled forms of epinephrine and ephedrine once were the only effective medications for treating asthma. Beginning in the 1980s, newer medications were introduced that target more of the abnormal conditions in asthma and do so more effectively than epinephrine or ephedrine. For example, prescription inhaler forms of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), including ''albuterol'' (Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, ''Xopenex''), and metaproterenol (''Alupent''), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) including Beclovent, Flovent, ''Qvar'', Asmanex, Asmacort, Arnuity, Pulmicort, Aerospan, Alvesco and ''AeroBid'', anticholinergics (ipratropium, tiotropium bromide, ''glycopyrrolate'', umeclidinium, [''Atrovent''], Spiriva, Incruse, Bevespi), and other medicines are now widely used because of their greater effectiveness and fewer side effects. The use of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications that include steroid agents such as fluticasone, ''budesonide'', beclomethasone, and flunisolide has become the mainstay of initial asthma therapy. Unfortunately, none of these medications is available without a prescription. Often, doctors prescribe these medications in combination with a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), such as ''salmeterol'', formoterol, or vilanterol. Some of the more common versions include Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo.' "
How do over-the-counter (OTC) asthma medications work?,"'Epinephrine acts by relaxing the muscles of the airways, thereby opening up the airways and allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs more easily. Ephedrine also relaxes the muscles of the airways. Essentially, these drugs work by stimulating the beta sympathetic receptors. However, these agents are not very specific and stimulate all beta receptors, resulting in increased side effects, including elevate blood pressure and heart rate.'  "
"What factors should 
patients consider in choosing and using OTC epinephrine or ephedrine?","""Despite the development of newer medications, epinephrine and ephedrine remain available as OTC medications. The choice of epinephrine or ephedrine should involve consideration of several factors. Most importantly, the asthma should be mild and less frequent, defined as occurring less than once per week and resolving almost immediately. It's best to use OTC epinephrine or ephedrine under the guidance of a physician, if used at all. A patient should seek medical attention and prepare to switch to a prescription asthma medication in most cases, but especially if:""'OTC epinephrine is available in various concentrations for oral ''inhalation'' or as a solution in vaporized form (nebulization). Both forms may or may not contain ''alcohol'' or sulfite as preservatives. For example, AsthmaHaler Mist does not contain alcohol. Alcohol and sulfite preservatives may trigger an ''asthma attack'', and therefore, patients whose asthma is sensitive to these preservatives should read product labels carefully. The nebulized epinephrine solutions may or may not require diluting with a separate saline (salt) solution before use. Several saline solutions are available OTC in various concentrations. Again, careful reading of the label will provide information about combining an epinephrine solution for nebulization with a specific saline solution. Oral epinephrine is unavailable because it is rapidly broken down in the ''digestive system'' before it can reach the lungs. Once inhaled, epinephrine should provide rapid relief of symptoms (within five to 10 minutes) and continue working for one to three hours. Good inhaler and nebulizing techniques are critical in the use of epinephrine. If patients use epinephrine frequently, tolerance to its effects occurs; that is, repeated inhalations provide progressively less and less benefit. Previously chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used as the propellant for inhaler therapy. These have been banned and replaced by alternative propellant, hydrofloroalkane (HFA). The CFCs were felt to contribute to damage to the ozone layer.''OTC ephedrine is available only as an oral medication in combination with ''guaifenesin'"" as caplets, tablets, or syrup. (Guaifenesin is an expectorant that reportedly loosens mucus in the airways and facilitates its removal by coughing, though health researchers haven't proven this conclusively.) Use caution when first starting these products since they occasionally irritate the airways of some patients and may make the asthma worse. OTC ephedrine should provide relief of symptoms within 15-60 minutes and may continue to be effective for three to five hours. Continued use of ephedrine, like frequent use of epinephrine, leads to tolerance.""'Discontinue epinephrine or ephedrine if thick mucus or sputum (colored mucus) develops and/or a persistent or ''chronic cough'' occurs with the asthma. These may be signs of infection in the lungs and require immediate medical attention. If OTC asthma drugs do not relieve an episode of asthma within 10 (for epinephrine) or 60 minutes (for ephedrine) or the symptoms worsen, the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Repeated use of these agents should be strongly discouraged, unless under direct medical supervision.' moderate to severe asthma develops; frequent or regular doses of epinephrine or ephedrine are needed to relieve symptoms; episodes of asthma occur once or more per week; or asthmatic episodes develop at night."
What side effects and drug interactions are there with OTC asthma medicines?,"'Ephedrine poses a greater risk of causing adverse drug effects or ''drug interactions'' than epinephrine because it must be absorbed into the body to be effective. Nervousness, ''sleeplessness'', ''anxiety'', ''nausea'', reduced appetite, rapid heartbeat, ''tremors'' (the ""shakes""), and ''urinary retention'' are the most common adverse effects. Immediate medical attention may be necessary for these side effects.''Monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (phenelzine, isocarboxazid), ''clonidine'', ''selegiline'', guanethidine, and ergotamines (ergotamine tartrate, dihydroergotamine mesylate) may increase blood pressure when used at the same time as ephedrine. ''Methyldopa'' or reserpine may reduce ephedrine levels in the blood and thereby lessen the effectiveness of ephedrine. ''Tricyclic antidepressants'' (''desipramine'', ''amitriptyline'', ''doxepin'', and ''imipramine'') may block the effect of ephedrine. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ''acetazolamide'' and dichlorphenamide may increase ephedrine blood levels and the risk of side effects from ephedrine. Patients taking any medications should consult with their physician or pharmacist before starting OTC ephedrine.''Since patients with asthma inhale epinephrine directly into the lungs and little is absorbed into other organs of the body, there is less risk for side effects. Epinephrine may cause rapid heartbeat, irregular heart rhythms, ''high blood pressure'', ''tremor'', or ''anxiety''.''Since there are specific risks with epinephrine or ephedrine in certain medical conditions, physician advice and supervision should be sought before taking epinephrine or ephedrine if there is ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'', congestive ''heart failure'', irregular heart rhythms), ''high blood pressure'', ''thyroid disease'', ''diabetes'', or ''difficulty urinating'' due to enlargement of the prostate. In addition, patients should seek medical advice before taking ephedrine if they are already taking ''antidepressants''.'  "
What are additional measures in the management of asthma?," Patients should avoid known triggers of asthma attacks (for example, exercise or allergens). Good control of allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies) helps to control asthma. Now there are OTC inhaled nasal steroids (Nasonex, Flonase) that are available and very effective in treating allergic rhinitis. It is important to understand that using these agents does not immediately relieve symptoms. It often requires seven or more days of use to realize the true effectiveness of these medications. Chronic sinus disease also often is associated with asthma. Some patients with asthma must avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and Motrin since they may induce an episode of asthma. All asthma patients should try to avoid beta-blocker drugs (Inderal, Tenormin, Visken, and Lopressor) because they may worsen asthma or precipitate an episode. This is not always the case, but an asthma history is an important consideration when prescribing. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is often associated with asthma, sometimes as a precipitant and at other times the result of treatment. All patients with asthma should seek professional advice from their physicians on optimally managing their condition. It is probably best to avoid over-the-counter treatment unless directed to do so by a physician or practitioner knowledgeable in the treatment and diagnosis of asthma."
Asthma vs. COPD: What are the differences?," Asthma is characterized by reversible airway narrowing, whereas COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) typically has fixed airway narrowing. Some symptoms of COPD are similar to asthma, including wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough. The cough in COPD can be more productive of mucus than asthma, and patients with severe COPD may need oxygen supplementation. COPD is very often a result of cigarette smoke exposure, either direct or secondhand, although severe asthma can evolve to COPD over time in the absence of smoke exposure. Medications used to treat COPD include inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroid/bronchodilator combinations, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and oral steroids. There is a newly described syndrome called asthma/COPD overlap syndrome that displays characteristics of both asthma and COPD. This is an area of medicine that needs further study."
What are risk factors and causes of asthma?,"""Asthma results from complex interactions between an individual's ""'inherited'' genetic ''makeup'' and interactions with the environment. The factors that cause a genetically predisposed individual to become ''asthmatic'' are poorly understood. The following are risk factors for asthma:'  Family history of allergic conditions Personal history of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) Viral respiratory illness, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), during childhood Exposure to cigarette smoke Obesity Lower socioeconomic status Exposure to air pollution or burning biomass"
What are the different types of asthma?,"""Asthma may not be the same in different affected individuals. Asthma specialists currently use a variety of clinical data to categorize a patient's asthma. This data includes the age of asthma onset, the presence or absence of environmental ""'allergies'', the presence or absence of elevated blood or sputum levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), lung function testing (''spirometry'' and fractional excretion of nitric oxide), obesity, and cigarette smoke exposure.''Your doctor may refer to asthma as being ""allergic"" or ""eosinophilic."" One or both of these characteristics make up a ""T2 high"" phenotype of asthma, which is the term for the type of immune inflammation associated with asthma. The allergic type typically develops in childhood and is associated with environmental ''allergies'', which approximately 70%-80% of children with asthma have. Typically, there is a family history of ''allergies''. Additionally, other allergic conditions, such as ''food allergies'' or ''eczema'', are often also present. Allergic asthma often goes into remission in early adulthood. However, in many cases, the asthma reappears later. Sometimes allergic asthma can appear with elevated blood or sputum eosinophils. Asthma that develops in adulthood may be associated with sputum or blood eosinophils but without environmental allergies. Sometimes patients in this category also have ''nasal polyps'', which are eosinophil-rich growths in the nasal lining.''Non T2 asthma, or T2 low asthma, comprises a smaller yet difficult to treat proportion of asthma that is not associated with allergies or eosinophils. This type of asthma is sometimes called ""neutrophilic asthma"" and may be associated with obesity.'  "
What are asthma symptoms and signs?,"'The classic signs and ''symptoms of asthma'' are shortness of breath, cough (often worse at night), and wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound produced by turbulent airflow through narrow airways, typically with ''exhalation''). Many patients also report ''chest tightness''. It is important to note that these symptoms are episodic, and individuals with asthma can go long periods without any symptoms.''Common triggers for asthmatic symptoms include exposure to allergens (pets, dust mites, cockroach, molds, and pollens), ''exercise'', and viral infections. Other triggers include strong emotion, odor exposure, and temperature extremes. Tobacco use or exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' complicates asthma management.''Many of the symptoms and signs of asthma are nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions as well. Symptoms that might suggest conditions other than asthma include new symptom onset in older age, the presence of associated symptoms (such as chest discomfort, ''lightheadedness'', ''palpitations'', and ''fatigue''), and lack of response to appropriate ''medications for asthma''.''The physical exam in asthma is often completely normal. Occasionally, wheezing is present. In an asthma exacerbation, the respiratory rate increases, the ''heart'' rate increases, and the work of ''respiration'' increases. Individuals often require accessory muscles to breathe, and breath sounds can be diminished. It is important to note that the blood oxygen level typically remains fairly normal even in the midst of a significant asthma exacerbation. Low blood oxygen level is therefore concerning for impending respiratory failure.'  "
How do doctors diagnose asthma?,"'The diagnosis of asthma begins with a detailed history and physical examination. Primary-care providers are familiar with the diagnosis of asthma, but specialists such as allergists or pulmonologists may be involved. A typical history is an individual with a family history of allergic conditions or a personal history of allergic rhinitis who experiences ''coughing'', wheezing, and difficulty ''breathing'', especially with ''exercise'', viral infections, or during the night. In addition to a typical history, improvement with a trial of appropriate medications is very suggestive of asthma.''In addition to the history and exam, the following are diagnostic procedures that can be used to help with the diagnosis of asthma:' Lung function testing with spirometry: This test measures lung function as the patient breathes into a tube. If lung function improves significantly following the administration of a bronchodilator, such as albuterol, this essentially confirms the diagnosis of asthma. It is important to note, however, that normal lung function testing does not rule out the possibility of asthma. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO): This can be performed by a quick and relatively simple breathing maneuver, similar to spirometry. Elevated levels of exhaled nitric oxide are suggestive of T2 inflammation seen in some types of asthma. Skin testing for common aeroallergens: The presence of sensitivities to environmental allergies increases the likelihood of asthma. Of note, skin testing is more accurate than blood work (in vitro testing) for environmental allergies. Testing for food allergies is not indicated in the diagnosis of asthma. Doctors often perform blood tests for the allergic antibody (IgE) and eosinophils to establish the present of T2 high asthma. Other potential but less commonly used tests include provocation testing such as a methacholine challenge, which tests for airway hyperresponsiveness. Hyperresponsiveness is the tendency of the breathing tubes to constrict or narrow in response to irritants. A negative methacholine challenge makes asthma unlikely. Specialists sometimes also measure sputum eosinophils, another marker for ""allergic"" inflammation seen in asthma. Chest X-rays or CT-scans may show hyperinflation, but are often normal in asthma. Tests to rule out other conditions, such as cardiac testing, may also be indicated in certain cases."
What are asthma treatment options? Are there home remedies for asthma?,"'The treatment goals for asthma are to:''Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents available for the chronic treatment of asthma and are first-line therapy per most asthma guidelines. It is well recognized that ICS are effective in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the combination of a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA) and an ICS has a significant additional beneficial effect on improving asthma control. Short-acting rescue inhalers are the standard of care for break through symptoms.''The most commonly used ''asthma medications'' include the following:''There is often concern about potential long-term side effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Numerous studies have repeatedly shown that even long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids has very few if any sustained, clinically significant side effects, including changes in bone health, growth, or weight. However, the goal always remains to treat all individuals with the least amount of medication that is effective. Patients with asthma should be routinely reassessed for any appropriate changes to their medical regimen.''Asthma medications can be administered via inhalers either with or without a spacer or nebulized solution. It is important to note that if an individual has proper technique with an inhaler, the amount of medication deposited in the ''lungs'' is no different than that when using a nebulized solution. When prescribing asthma medications, it is essential to provide the appropriate teaching on proper delivery technique.''Smoking cessation'' and/or minimizing exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' are critical when treating asthma. Treating concurrent conditions such as allergic rhinitis and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') may also improve asthma control. ''Vaccinations'' such as the annual ''influenza'' vaccination and ''pneumonia'' vaccination are also indicated.''Although the vast majority of individuals with asthma are treated as outpatients, treatment of severe exacerbations can require management in the emergency department or hospital. These individuals typically require use of supplemental oxygen, early administration of systemic steroids, and frequent or even continuous administration of bronchodilators via a nebulized solution. Individuals at high risk for poor asthma outcomes are referred to a specialist (''pulmonologist'' or allergist). The following factors should prompt consideration or referral:'   adequately control symptoms, minimize the risk of future exacerbations, maintain normal lung function, maintain normal activity levels, and take the least amount of medication possible with the least amount of potential side effects. Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol [Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, ProAir RespiClick, Maxair, Xopenex]) provide quick relief for symptoms occurring despite controller medications. These may also be used alone in patients with occasional symptoms or patients experiencing symptoms with exercise only. Inhaled steroids (budesonide [Pulmicort Turbuhaler, Pulmicort Respules], fluticasone [Flovent, Arnuity Ellipta, Armon Air RespiClick], beclomethasone [Qvar], mometasone [Asmanex], ciclesonide [Alvesco], flunisolide [Aerobid, Aerospan]) are first-line anti-inflammatory therapies. Long-acting bronchodilators (salmeterol [Serevent], formoterol [Foradil], vilanterol) can be added to ICS as additive therapy. LABAs should never be used alone for the treatment of asthma. ICS/LABA combination agents combine corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair, AirDuo, Wixela), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), fluticasone/vilanterol (Breo), mometasone/formoterol (Dulera). Leukotriene modifiers (montelukast [Singulair], zafirlukast [Accolate], zileuton [Zyflo]) can also serve as anti-inflammatory agents. Anticholinergic agents or antimuscarinic agents (ipratropium [Atrovent, Atrovent HFA], tiotropium [Spiriva], umeclidinium [Incruse Ellipta]) can help decrease sputum production. There is one triple combination agent of an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting bronchodilator, and anti-muscarinic agent: fluticasone/vilanterol/umeclidium (Trelegy) that is most often used for asthma/COPD overlap. Anti-IgE treatment (omalizumab [Xolair]) can be used in allergic asthma. Anti-IL5 treatment (mepolizumab [Nucala], reslizumab [Cinqair], and benralizumab [Fasenra]) can be used in eosinophilic asthma. Anti IL-4 receptor antagonist (dupilumab, Dupixent) is approved for moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma. It is also approved for atopic dermatitis and nasal polyposis. Chromones (cromolyn [Intal, Opticrom, Gastrocrom], nedocromil [Alocril]) stabilize mast cells (allergic cells) but are rarely used in clinical practice. Theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24) also helps with bronchodilation (opening the airways) but is rarely used in clinical practice due to an unfavorable side-effect profile. Systemic steroids (prednisone [Deltasone, Liquid Pred], prednisolone [Flo-Pred, Pediapred, Orapred, Orapred ODT], methylprednisolone [Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol], dexamethasone [DexPak]) are potent anti-inflammatory agents that are routinely used to treat asthma exacerbations but pose numerous unwanted side effects if used repeatedly or chronically. Numerous additional monoclonal antibodies are also currently being studied and will likely be available within the next couple of years. Immunotherapy or allergy shots have been shown to decrease medication reliance in allergic asthma. There are no home remedies that have proven benefit for asthma. History of ICU admission or multiple hospitalizations for asthma History of multiple visits to the emergency department for asthma History of frequent or daily use of systemic steroids for asthma Ongoing symptoms despite the use of appropriate medications Significant allergies contributing to poorly controlled asthma"
What should someone do when experiencing an asthma attack?,"'Patients experiencing acute ''asthma symptoms'' should first use their rescue inhaler (albuterol). If asthma symptoms are worsening and use of albuterol is increasing, then asthma patients should have a medical evaluation. A course of oral steroids may be indicated and an adjustment in asthma maintenance therapy may be needed. If symptoms are rapidly progressive, asthma patients should seek emergency medical care.' "
What is an asthma action plan?,'Patient education is a critical component in the successful management of asthma. An asthma action plan provides an individual with specific directions for daily asthma management and for adjusting medications in response to increasing symptoms or decreasing lung function.'  
What is the prognosis for asthma?,"'The prognosis for asthma is generally favorable. Children experience complete remission more often than adults. Although adults with asthma experience a greater rate of loss in their lung function as compared to age-controlled counterparts, this decline is usually not as severe as seen in other conditions, such as ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD) or ''emphysema''. Asthma in the absence of other comorbidities does not appear to shorten life expectancy. Risk factors for poor prognosis from asthma include''The airway narrowing in asthma may become fixed over time and can resemble COPD or ''emphysema''. The other main complication of asthma is due to side effects from oral steroid use, which can include bone loss (''osteoporosis''), ''weight gain'', and glucose intolerance.' a history of hospitalizations, especially ICU admissions or intubation, frequent reliance on systemic steroids, significant medical comorbidities."
Is it possible to prevent asthma?,"'With the increasing prevalence of asthma, numerous studies have looked for risk factors and ways to potentially prevent asthma. It has been shown that individuals living on farms are protected against wheezing, asthma, and even environmental allergies. The role of air pollution has been questioned in both the increased incidence of asthma and in regards to asthma exacerbations.''Climate change is also being studied as a factor in the increased incidence of asthma. Maternal ''smoking during pregnancy'' is a risk factor for asthma and poor outcomes. Tobacco smoke is also a significant risk factor for the development and progression of asthma. Treatment of environmental allergies with ''allergen'' immunotherapy, or ''allergy'"" shots, has been shown to decrease a child's risk of developing asthma. The development of asthma is ultimately a complex process influenced by many environmental and genetic factors, and currently there is no proven way to decrease an individual's risk of developing asthma."" "
Facts you should know about COPD vs. asthma,"   COPD is mainly due to damage caused by smoking, while asthma is due to an inflammatory reaction. COPD is a progressive disease, while allergic reactions of asthma can be reversible. Initial symptoms can be similar in both diseases, for example, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough, which can lead to confusion or misdiagnosis. Both diseases can have severe, dangerous signs and symptoms, for example, a bluish discoloration of the skin, and respiratory distress. Death may even occur. Initial treatments of COPD include bronchodilators, while initial treatments for asthma include inhaled corticosteroids while initial treatments. COPD usually develops after age 40 and often becomes a chronic disease of lung function. Asthma may develop in people of almost any age."
What is COPD?,"'COPD'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'') is a lung disease caused by chronic interference with lung airflow that impairs ''breathing'', and is not fully reversible. Usually symptoms, for example, ''shortness of breath'', recurrent ''coughing'', clearing throat, and progressive ''exercise'' tolerance, worsen over time. Many doctors and researchers (for example, the World Health Organization) consider terms such as ''chronic bronchitis'' and ''emphysema'' as forms of ''COPD''. The major cause of COPD is ''smoking''.' "
What is asthma?,"'Asthma'' is a respiratory condition marked by spasms of the bronchi, due to inflamed and narrowed airways in the ''lungs''. ''Asthma'' causes difficulty in ''breathing'' that often results from an ''allergic reaction''. Many substances may trigger asthma attacks. Asthma usually causes recurring periods of shortness of breath, ''wheezing'' and/or chest tightness. Often, asthma can be fully reversible with medical treatment and breathing can return to normal.' "
Symptoms and signs: 6 similarities between COPD vs. asthma,'Similarities in signs and symptoms are between the two conditions are:'  Coughing Shortness of breath Chest tightness Exercise intolerance Wheezing (a whistling or squeaking sound in the chest) Anxiety with increased heart rate may occur in both diseases.
Symptoms and signs: 6 differences between COPD vs. asthma," In asthma, breathing can return to normal between attacks, while breathing with COPD usually does not return to normal. The symptoms of COPD gradually become more severe. (This also may occur if you have asthma.) COPD produces more mucus and phlegm compared to asthma. Chronic cough is common with COPD. People with COPD often have chronic blueness to fingernail beds and/or lips (cyanosis). Asthma can occur in a person of almost any age, while COPD usually occurs in those over age 40. (Although it is possible in some individuals to develop COPD a younger age.)"
Causes of COPD vs. asthma,"'COPD is caused by long-term exposure to lung irritants that damage lung cells. The main cause of COPD in the United States is ''cigarette'' smoke followed by other tobacco smoke (including second hand smoke). Other possible causes of COPD include chemical or toxic fumes, and ''inherited'' (genetic) factors, like ''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'', but these causes are far less common than ''cigarette smoking''.''Although ''cigarette'' smoke may trigger asthma in some patients, asthma triggers are different from person to person, and most commonly include airborne substances such as ''pollen'', dust, mites, ''mold'' spores, pet dander, and/or many other substances. Inflammatory immune reactions to asthma triggers in the airways is the main cause of asthma.'  "
COPD vs. asthma treatment guidelines and management,"'There are many treatment options and ways to manage COPD. The newest 2017 guidelines emphasize the use of combined ''bronchodilators'' as first-line therapy for COPD. Doctors recommend ''vaccinations'' for people with the condition to decrease the risk of lower respiratory tract infections. Alterations in health-related behaviors (for example, stopping ''smoking'') is emphasized. ''Spirometry'' measurements can help determine the extent of obstructive lung disease. As COPD progresses, oxygen therapy, especially if you have obstructive ''sleep apnea'', may help improve your survival.''Like COPD, there are many treatment options and ways to manage asthma. Your primary care doctor and/or an allergist will discuss and suggest the best choice of treatment and management ''drugs'' for you. Medications used include ''corticosteroids'', short acting beta agonists (for example, ''albuterol'', or Proventil and other brand names), and occasionally anticholinergic medications for severe exacerbations.''Occasionally, for long-term treatment and management of asthma, doctors will prescribe long-acting anticholinergic medications (for example, ''salmeterol'' [''Serevent''] and formoterol [''Foradil'']), corticosteroids, and/or other ''drugs'' combinations of drugs. You and your allergist may need to try different drugs to find the most effective treatment for your condition. Your doctor may recommend ''allergy shots'' (immunotherapy) if you have become desensitized to certain asthma triggers.''Emergency treatment of life-threatening asthma or COPD may involve intravenous corticosteroids, ''intubation'', mechanical ventilation, and oxygen treatment until the crisis is resolved.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person COPD vs. asthma?,"'The prognosis for COPD ranges from fair to poor and depends on how rapidly COPD advances over time. In general, individuals with COPD have a decrease in their lifespan according to research.''If you have asthma, the prognosis for most people ranges from fair to excellent, depending upon how well you can identify what triggers your attacks, and your response to medication.' "
Asthma introduction,"'Asthma'' is a disease in which there is a brief, temporary narrowing of the airways in the ''lungs'', referred to as bronchospasm. This is only part of the picture. The main problem in ''asthma'' involves inflammation and swelling of the airways. It is important to understand that the lungs have a series of tubes akin to branches of tree leading to each of the air sacs of the lungs. When these tubes become inflamed, the walls thicken and the opening of the tube narrows. This causes increased resistance for air flow. In addition, these changes make it easier for bronchospasm to occur. Both bronchospasm and thickened ''airway'' walls prevent air from moving in and out of the lungs easily. As a result, a patient with ''asthma'' has episodic difficulty ''breathing''. An ''asthmatic'' episode can resolve spontaneously or may require treatment.''It is crucial to understand that over time the airway inflammation associated with asthma can result in permanent remodeling/scarring of the airways. When this occurs and lung function no longer returns normal when not having an attack, Asthma moves into the category of disease known as ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). Therefore, if persistent symptoms of ''chest tightness'', ''cough'', ''wheezing'', ''shortness of breath'' occur, it is imperative to be evaluated by a physician. Even mild symptoms, if long lasting, can reflect chronic inflammation and progress to ''COPD''. The available ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications treat bronchospasm primarily and have little, if any, effect on airway inflammation. It is not advisable to use over-the-counter asthma medication unless instructed by a physician knowledgeable in the treatment of asthma. Airway inflammation is treated by prescription medications such as ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ''zafirlukast'' (''Accolate''), and inhaled ''corticosteroids'' (steroids).''Asthmatic patients and their physicians may select from a wide variety of prescription medications. This is not true for OTC medicines, which are limited to epinephrine (adrenaline) and ''ephedrine''. In addition, many asthmatic patients should not use epinephrine or ephedrine because of their relatively weak effectiveness or side effects.''To decide whether an OTC epinephrine or ephedrine product may be useful, patients should understand:''The advantages of using OTC ''medications for asthma'' include their affordability and accessibility (lack of need for a prescription and/or health insurance approval). Unfortunately, these medications are less effective at controlling asthma and sometimes can be more dangerous.''Recently, the FDA published safety concerns about the new medication Asthmanefrin and the EZ Breathe atomizer. They report complications such as ''chest pain'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', increased ''blood pressure'', increased ''heart'' rate, and ''coughing up blood''. Even more disconcerting, they have reports of a choking hazard from a washer dislodged during atomizer use.''Most pulmonary and ''allergy'' specialists would discourage the use of these OTC medications unless ''asthma symptoms'' are extremely mild and infrequent.' the abnormal conditions that exist in the airways of asthmatics; the effects of epinephrine and ephedrine; the specific factors that should be considered when choosing and using epinephrine and ephedrine; and the side effects of these drugs."
What is asthma?,"'The cause of asthma is unknown. Physicians know more about the abnormal conditions that occur in asthma. These conditions include:''Each of these conditions narrow the airways and make breathing difficult. Asthma symptoms include wheezing (the hallmark of asthma), ''coughing'', difficulty breathing, and tightness of the chest. Health care professionals diagnose asthma by the presence of wheezing, though wheezing can occur with other diseases, such as airway narrowing from other diseases, or excess fluid from ''congestive heart failure''. Other common symptoms, such as ''cough'' and shortness of breath, help determine if asthma is present. Breathing tests (''spirometry'') that evaluate the movement of air into and out of the lungs can be very helpful in making the diagnosis. Normally, one can exhale 70% of the air from the lungs in one second with a forced ''exhalation''. In asthma, this number is often reduced when a patient is having symptoms. When they are better, the volume of air exhaled in that first second (referred to as FEV1, forced expired volume in one second) often is normal. This reversibility also helps confirm the diagnosis. Often a ''bronchodilator'' is administered after initial testing to determine if the airways dilate, another confirmatory test. Some have a type of asthma referred to as cough variant asthma. In this situation, patients have a cough that is chronic or recurrent with the presence of normal lung function.'   hyper-responsiveness (contraction) of the muscles of the breathing airways in response to many stimuli such as exercise or allergies (for example, drugs, food additives, dust mites, animal fur, and mold); inflammation of the airways; shedding of the tissue lining the airways; increased secretion of mucus in the airways; and swelling of the airways with fluid."
What medications treat asthma?,"'Prior to modern medicine, people smoked a variety of plants and herbs in an effort to treat asthma. Some were mildly efficacious, while others were just plain dangerous. Oral and inhaled forms of epinephrine and ephedrine once were the only effective medications for treating asthma. Beginning in the 1980s, newer medications were introduced that target more of the abnormal conditions in asthma and do so more effectively than epinephrine or ephedrine. For example, prescription inhaler forms of short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), including ''albuterol'' (Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir, ''Xopenex''), and metaproterenol (''Alupent''), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) including Beclovent, Flovent, ''Qvar'', Asmanex, Asmacort, Arnuity, Pulmicort, Aerospan, Alvesco and ''AeroBid'', anticholinergics (ipratropium, tiotropium bromide, ''glycopyrrolate'', umeclidinium, [''Atrovent''], Spiriva, Incruse, Bevespi), and other medicines are now widely used because of their greater effectiveness and fewer side effects. The use of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications that include steroid agents such as fluticasone, ''budesonide'', beclomethasone, and flunisolide has become the mainstay of initial asthma therapy. Unfortunately, none of these medications is available without a prescription. Often, doctors prescribe these medications in combination with a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), such as ''salmeterol'', formoterol, or vilanterol. Some of the more common versions include Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, and Breo.' "
How do over-the-counter (OTC) asthma medications work?,"'Epinephrine acts by relaxing the muscles of the airways, thereby opening up the airways and allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs more easily. Ephedrine also relaxes the muscles of the airways. Essentially, these drugs work by stimulating the beta sympathetic receptors. However, these agents are not very specific and stimulate all beta receptors, resulting in increased side effects, including elevate blood pressure and heart rate.'  "
"What factors should 
patients consider in choosing and using OTC epinephrine or ephedrine?","""Despite the development of newer medications, epinephrine and ephedrine remain available as OTC medications. The choice of epinephrine or ephedrine should involve consideration of several factors. Most importantly, the asthma should be mild and less frequent, defined as occurring less than once per week and resolving almost immediately. It's best to use OTC epinephrine or ephedrine under the guidance of a physician, if used at all. A patient should seek medical attention and prepare to switch to a prescription asthma medication in most cases, but especially if:""'OTC epinephrine is available in various concentrations for oral ''inhalation'' or as a solution in vaporized form (nebulization). Both forms may or may not contain ''alcohol'' or sulfite as preservatives. For example, AsthmaHaler Mist does not contain alcohol. Alcohol and sulfite preservatives may trigger an ''asthma attack'', and therefore, patients whose asthma is sensitive to these preservatives should read product labels carefully. The nebulized epinephrine solutions may or may not require diluting with a separate saline (salt) solution before use. Several saline solutions are available OTC in various concentrations. Again, careful reading of the label will provide information about combining an epinephrine solution for nebulization with a specific saline solution. Oral epinephrine is unavailable because it is rapidly broken down in the ''digestive system'' before it can reach the lungs. Once inhaled, epinephrine should provide rapid relief of symptoms (within five to 10 minutes) and continue working for one to three hours. Good inhaler and nebulizing techniques are critical in the use of epinephrine. If patients use epinephrine frequently, tolerance to its effects occurs; that is, repeated inhalations provide progressively less and less benefit. Previously chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were used as the propellant for inhaler therapy. These have been banned and replaced by alternative propellant, hydrofloroalkane (HFA). The CFCs were felt to contribute to damage to the ozone layer.''OTC ephedrine is available only as an oral medication in combination with ''guaifenesin'"" as caplets, tablets, or syrup. (Guaifenesin is an expectorant that reportedly loosens mucus in the airways and facilitates its removal by coughing, though health researchers haven't proven this conclusively.) Use caution when first starting these products since they occasionally irritate the airways of some patients and may make the asthma worse. OTC ephedrine should provide relief of symptoms within 15-60 minutes and may continue to be effective for three to five hours. Continued use of ephedrine, like frequent use of epinephrine, leads to tolerance.""'Discontinue epinephrine or ephedrine if thick mucus or sputum (colored mucus) develops and/or a persistent or ''chronic cough'' occurs with the asthma. These may be signs of infection in the lungs and require immediate medical attention. If OTC asthma drugs do not relieve an episode of asthma within 10 (for epinephrine) or 60 minutes (for ephedrine) or the symptoms worsen, the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Repeated use of these agents should be strongly discouraged, unless under direct medical supervision.' moderate to severe asthma develops; frequent or regular doses of epinephrine or ephedrine are needed to relieve symptoms; episodes of asthma occur once or more per week; or asthmatic episodes develop at night."
What side effects and drug interactions are there with OTC asthma medicines?,"'Ephedrine poses a greater risk of causing adverse drug effects or ''drug interactions'' than epinephrine because it must be absorbed into the body to be effective. Nervousness, ''sleeplessness'', ''anxiety'', ''nausea'', reduced appetite, rapid heartbeat, ''tremors'' (the ""shakes""), and ''urinary retention'' are the most common adverse effects. Immediate medical attention may be necessary for these side effects.''Monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (phenelzine, isocarboxazid), ''clonidine'', ''selegiline'', guanethidine, and ergotamines (ergotamine tartrate, dihydroergotamine mesylate) may increase blood pressure when used at the same time as ephedrine. ''Methyldopa'' or reserpine may reduce ephedrine levels in the blood and thereby lessen the effectiveness of ephedrine. ''Tricyclic antidepressants'' (''desipramine'', ''amitriptyline'', ''doxepin'', and ''imipramine'') may block the effect of ephedrine. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ''acetazolamide'' and dichlorphenamide may increase ephedrine blood levels and the risk of side effects from ephedrine. Patients taking any medications should consult with their physician or pharmacist before starting OTC ephedrine.''Since patients with asthma inhale epinephrine directly into the lungs and little is absorbed into other organs of the body, there is less risk for side effects. Epinephrine may cause rapid heartbeat, irregular heart rhythms, ''high blood pressure'', ''tremor'', or ''anxiety''.''Since there are specific risks with epinephrine or ephedrine in certain medical conditions, physician advice and supervision should be sought before taking epinephrine or ephedrine if there is ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'', congestive ''heart failure'', irregular heart rhythms), ''high blood pressure'', ''thyroid disease'', ''diabetes'', or ''difficulty urinating'' due to enlargement of the prostate. In addition, patients should seek medical advice before taking ephedrine if they are already taking ''antidepressants''.'  "
What are additional measures in the management of asthma?," Patients should avoid known triggers of asthma attacks (for example, exercise or allergens). Good control of allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies) helps to control asthma. Now there are OTC inhaled nasal steroids (Nasonex, Flonase) that are available and very effective in treating allergic rhinitis. It is important to understand that using these agents does not immediately relieve symptoms. It often requires seven or more days of use to realize the true effectiveness of these medications. Chronic sinus disease also often is associated with asthma. Some patients with asthma must avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and Motrin since they may induce an episode of asthma. All asthma patients should try to avoid beta-blocker drugs (Inderal, Tenormin, Visken, and Lopressor) because they may worsen asthma or precipitate an episode. This is not always the case, but an asthma history is an important consideration when prescribing. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is often associated with asthma, sometimes as a precipitant and at other times the result of treatment. All patients with asthma should seek professional advice from their physicians on optimally managing their condition. It is probably best to avoid over-the-counter treatment unless directed to do so by a physician or practitioner knowledgeable in the treatment and diagnosis of asthma."
Introduction,"'Astigmatic'' keratotomy eye surgery is safe and effective, but in recent years has been largely replaced by ''LASIK'', according to doctors from The Cleveland Clinic. The ''cornea'' of people who have ''astigmatism'' is shaped like a football. Astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery corrects ''astigmatism'' by making one or two incisions at the steepest part of the cornea. These incisions cause the cornea to relax and take a more rounded shape.''People with mild prescriptions generally have the best success in obtaining normal vision after astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery.

   Discomfort (usually lasting 2-3 days) 
   Results, both good and bad, are irreversible "
What Are the Potential Side Effects of Astigmatic Keratotomy Eye Surgery?,"'Although rare, side effects from astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery can occur. They may include:' Fluctuating vision, especially during the first few months after surgery 
   A weakened cornea, more vulnerable to rupture if hit directly 
   Infection 
   Difficulty in fitting contact lenses 
   Glare or starburst around lights that can sometimes be permanent "
How Should I Prepare for the Procedure?,"'Before your astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery you will have met with a coordinator who will discuss what you should expect during and after the surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated, and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery.''If you wear rigid ''gas'"" permeable contact lenses, you should not wear them during the three weeks before astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery. Be sure to bring your ""'eyeglasses'' to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed. '""On the day of your astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor's office, and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye ""'makeup'"" or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery needs to be postponed."" "
What Happens During Astigmatic Keratotomy Eye Surgery?,"""Astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery is done under a local anesthesia and the entire procedure lasts a maximum of 10 minutes for both eyes. It involves making one or two incisions at the steepest part of the cornea. This causes the cornea's football-shape, which is causing the astigmatism, to relax into a rounded shape."" "
What Should I Expect After Astigmatic Keratotomy Eye Surgery?,"'Your eye may be sensitive to light for a few hours or feel like there is a foreign object in it. Your doctor will prescribe eye drops for you that will help prevent infection and inflammation, and reduce the feeling that you have a foreign object in your eye.''While a reduction in the astigmatism is often observable by the day after surgery, it generally takes a few weeks before the results stabilize. In cases of severe astigmatism - which can be reduced by astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery but not eliminated -- new eyeglasses will be prescribed a month after surgery.''Very often people with astigmatism also have another vision problem, such as  ''farsightedness'' . For these people, their vision without eyeglasses after the astigmatic keratotomy eye surgery may get worse at first. In order to achieve good vision without eyeglasses, a second procedure, such as  ''LASIK''  must be performed at a later date.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.\t\t\t\t' "
What Is Astigmatism?,"'Astigmatism'"" is a common eye condition that's easily corrected by ""'eyeglasses'',''contact lenses'' or surgery. ''Astigmatism'' is characterized by an irregular curvature of the ''cornea''. This is one type of refractive error. Astigmatism occurs in nearly everybody to some degree. For significant curvature, treatment is required. '""A person's eye is naturally spherical in shape. Under normal circumstances, when light enters the eye, it refracts evenly, creating a clear view of the object. However, the eye of a person with astigmatism is shaped more like a football or the back of a spoon. For this person, when light enters the eye it is refracted more in one direction than the other, allowing only part of the object to be in focus at one time. Objects at any distance can appear blurry and wavy. "" "
What Causes Astigmatism?,"'Astigmatism can be hereditary and is often present at birth. It can also result from pressure from the eyelids on the cornea, incorrect posture or an increased use of the eyes for close work.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Astigmatism?,"'People with undetected astigmatism often experience ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', eyestrain and ''blurred vision'' at all distances. While these symptoms may not necessarily be the result of astigmatism, you should schedule an eye exam if you are experiencing one or more symptoms. ' "
How Are Astigmatisms Diagnosed?,"'Your optometrist or ophthalmologist can diagnose astigmatism with a thorough eye exam. Astigmatism may occur with other refractive errors such as ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness'') and ''hyperopia'' (''farsightedness''). Unfortunately, astigmatism often goes undetected in school-age children. ''Because astigmatisms may increase slowly, you should visit your optometrist or ophthalmologist whenever you notice significant changes in your vision. Optometrists are trained specifically to examine the general health of the eyes and prescribe  eyeglasses and contact lenses. Ophthalmologists provide total ''eye care'', including exams, diagnosis, and treatment of disease through medication and surgery.' "
How Are Astigmatisms Treated?,"'Almost all degrees of astigmatism can be corrected with properly prescribed eyeglasses or contact lenses. For a person with only a slight degree of astigmatism, corrective lenses may not be needed at all, as long as other conditions such as nearsightedness or ''farsightedness'' are not present. If the astigmatism is moderate to high, however, corrective lenses are probably needed.''Refractive surgeries require healthy eyes that are free from retinal problems, corneal ''scars'' and any eye disease. As technology progresses, it is becoming more and more important that you explore all options and possibilities before deciding which refractive surgery and treatment is right for you.''WebMD Medical Reference' Corrective lenses (eyeglasses or contact lenses). For 
	astigmatism, special corrective lenses called toric lenses are prescribed. 
	Toric lenses have greater light bending power in one direction than the 
	other. After performing various tests, your eye doctor will determine the 
	ideal toric lens prescription for your astigmatism. Refractive surgery. 
	Another method for correcting astigmatism is by changing the shape of the 
	cornea through refractive or laser eye surgery. While there is more than one 
	type of refractive surgery, specific treatments are recommended on an 
	individual basis."
What is the definition of astigmatism?,"'In order to see clearly, the eye must be able to focus light into a single plane at the surface of the retina. The word ''astigmatism'' comes from the Greek ""a"" meaning ""without"" and ""stigma"" meaning ""spot."" In astigmatism, a point (or spot) of light is focused at two different planes, causing ''blurred vision''. An optical system (or eye) without astigmatism is called ""spherical"" and has only one plane of focus for all rays of light. An optical system with astigmatism is one in which rays that propagate in two perpendicular planes have different foci. For example, if an optical system with astigmatism is used to form an image of a plus sign, the vertical and horizontal lines will never be in focus at the same time, since they are in sharp focus at two distinctly different distances from the plus sign.''In an eye without astigmatism, the surface of the cornea is shaped like a sphere the way a ping-pong ball is, where all the curves are the same. This is called a spherical surface. In an eye with astigmatism, the surface of the cornea is shaped more like the bottom of a spoon, where there are two different surface curves located 90 degrees apart. This is called an ''astigmatic'' or toric surface.' "
What are the different types of astigmatism?,"'There are various classification systems for astigmatism, based on the anatomical source of the astigmatism, the regularity/ irregularity of astigmatism, or the direction of astigmatism.''Most astigmatism in the human eye has its source within the cornea, although there are irregularities of the ''lens'' that can lead to astigmatism, known as lenticular astigmatism.''Most corneal astigmatism is regular, signifying that the cornea is most curved (steepest) 90 degrees away from the surface of the cornea that is the least curved (flattest) and that the transition from most curved to least curved surface occurs in a regular manner. Regular astigmatism can be corrected with glasses, toric soft lenses, rigid lenses, or refractive surgery.''Irregular astigmatism is defined as the focus resulting from any corneal surface that is neither spherical nor regularly astigmatic. Irregular astigmatism cannot be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses.''A historical classification of astigmatism differentiates “with the rule” astigmatism from ""against the rule"" astigmatism. In ""with the rule"" astigmatism the steepest curvature (most curved part of the corneal surface) lies in or close to the vertical meridian, similar to the surface of a spoon lying on it side. In “against the rule” astigmatism, the steepest (most curved) part of the cornea is in or close to the horizontal meridian, similar to the surface of a football standing upright.' "
What causes astigmatism?,"'Most astigmatism does not have a recognized cause, but merely is an anatomical imperfection in the shape of the cornea, where the front curvature of the cornea is toric, rather than spherical. A small amount of astigmatism is considered normal and does not represent a disease of the eye. This type of astigmatism is extremely common and frequently is present at birth or has its onset during childhood or young adulthood. There is some hereditary basis to most cases of astigmatism, and most people with astigmatism have it in both eyes in a symmetrical fashion. Astigmatism is often associated with ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness'') or ''hyperopia'' (''farsightedness''). Astigmatism can increase in amount during the growing years.''In regular astigmatism, the meridians in which the two different curves lie are located 90 degrees apart. Most astigmatism is regular. In irregular astigmatism, the two meridians may be located at something other than 90 degrees apart or there are more than two meridians.''A ''scar'' in the cornea, resulting from an injury or infection, may also cause astigmatism. Astigmatism can be caused by ''ocular'' surgery, including ''cataract surgery'' and corneal transplantation. Certain diseases of the eye, such as ''keratoconus'' or pellucid degeneration, will cause irregular astigmatism.' "
Who is at risk for astigmatism?,'Individuals with a family history of high degrees of astigmatism or ''keratoconus'' are at risk for astigmatism. People who use power tools without safety glasses are subject to the type of injuries that may cause acquired astigmatism.' 
What are symptoms of astigmatism?,"'In an eye with astigmatism, vision is blurred due to the inability of the optical elements of the eye to focus a point object into a sharply focused point image on the retina. Astigmatism makes it difficult to see fine details, both close-up and at a distance.  Small amounts of astigmatism may not be noticed at all. Sometimes uncorrected astigmatism can lead to eyestrain, eye ''fatigue'', squinting, or ''headaches'' in addition to blurring and distortion of vision at all distances.'  "
What are signs of astigmatism?,'Astigmatism is detected by an ophthalmologist by either checking for the need for glasses (refraction) or actually measuring the curvature of the front of the cornea by using a keratometer or ''corneal topography'' machine. These tests are noninvasive and painless.' 
What tests are used to diagnose astigmatism?,"'The diagnosis of astigmatism is easily and painlessly made during the course of a complete eye examination. This would include a refraction (measuring the eyes for the need for glasses), an examination with a slit lamp, and measurements of the curvature of the corneas using various forms of light and computer algorithms.' "
What is the treatment for astigmatism?,"'Many patients with mild astigmatism have no symptoms from this and require no treatment. If there is regular astigmatism and it causes blurred vision, the astigmatism can be compensated for satisfactorily with ''eyeglasses'' or contact lenses. If ''myopia'' or hyperopia are also present, the glasses or contact lenses can also correct that condition. If the astigmatism is irregular or of a high degree, glasses or a soft contact lens may not fully correct the astigmatism and a hard (rigid) contact lens may be necessary to allow the eye to see normally. Neither glasses nor contact lenses permanently correct the curvature abnormality.''Modern refractive surgery, which reshapes the surface of the eye with a laser, can also be used to reduce or eliminate the astigmatism. Wavefront guided ''LASIK'' or ''photorefractive keratectomy'' (PRK) can also reduce irregular astigmatism. Various considerations involving ocular health, refractive status, and lifestyle frequently determine whether one option may be better than another.'  "
What is the prognosis for astigmatism?,"'About 30% of all people have astigmatism. In the vast majority of those, the condition does not change much after the age of 25. The presence of astigmatism as a child or young adult does not signify that an eye disease will later occur. Progressive astigmatism can occur with corneal ''trauma'', repeated infections of the cornea, and degenerative diseases such as ''keratoconus''.' "
Can astigmatism be prevented?,'The common types of astigmatism cannot be prevented.  The incidence of astigmatism due to trauma to the cornea can be decreased by attention to eye safety.' 
At what stage of cancer is chemotherapy used?,"'The decision to use ''chemotherapy'' may vary depending on the aggressiveness, stage and type of ''cancer''. Usually, chemotherapy may be used for all stages in most ''cancer'' types. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine or combination of medications that is used to treat or kill ''cancer'' cells.''Cancer treatment may include more than one type of therapy (surgery, ''radiation'', ''chemo'', etc.). The following describes the common ways that chemotherapy treatments are used''Common type of chemotherapy ''drugs'' are as follows' Adjuvant therapy: Chemotherapy may be used after surgery to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence (coming back). Neoadjuvant therapy: Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the tumor. This is to help the surgery be more successful. Concurrent therapy: Chemotherapy may be adjusted with other therapies (radiation and chemo). It is mostly used for aggressive or stubborn cancer types. Palliative chemotherapy: This may also be used to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and extend life for people with advanced cancer. Alkylating agents: These damage the DNA of cancer cells and prevent cell reproduction. These can be used in all phases of the cell lifecycle and for many types of cancers. However, they may destroy bone marrow and can sometimes lead to leukemia. Antimetabolites: These are used to damage cells when they’re preparing to multiply. These are often used to treat cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and intestinal tract cancer. Antitumor antibiotics: This usually prevents cancer cells from growing and reproducing by changing the DNA inside them. However, high doses may damage the heart. For this reason, doses are usually limited. Topoisomerase inhibitors: These are used to block the function of enzymes (proteins in the cells) that are critical to cancer cell reproduction. Mitotic inhibitors: These are made from natural substances such as plants. They destroy cancer cells by stopping cell division. However, because they prevent enzymes from providing proteins to both cancer cells and healthy cells, they can damage cells in all phases of their lifecycle."
How is chemotherapy given?,"'Most chemotherapy is used as systemic therapy, which means that the drugs travel around the bloodstream and can attack cancer cells almost anywhere in the body. Chemotherapy may be given to a patient in numerous ways' Topical: Patients may need to rub the drugs in the form of creams onto their skin. Oral: Patients may be asked to swallow a pill or liquid that has drugs to treat the cancer. Injection: Drugs are delivered with a shot directly into the muscles (hip, thigh or arm or in the fatty part of the patient’s arm, leg or stomach) just beneath the skin. Intravenous (IV): Chemotherapy goes directly into a vein. Intra-arterial (IA): Drugs go directly into the artery that is feeding the cancer through a needle or catheter (a soft, thin tube). Intraperitoneal (IP): Drugs are delivered into the peritoneal cavity, which contains organs such as the liver, intestines, stomach and ovaries. This is done during surgery or through a tube with a special port that is put in by the doctor. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy: Medicine is injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is found in the area surrounding the spinal cord and brain. Oral: The patient swallows a pill or liquid that has the drugs."
Why do patients have side effects with chemotherapy?,"'Chemotherapy usually works on cells that are actively growing and dividing. Cancer cells grow and divide quickly; hence, chemotherapy targets them quickly. However, chemotherapy can’t tell the difference between cancer cells and normal cells. Some normal cells, such as those in the hair follicles and lining of the ''digestive system'', also grow and divide more quickly than other cells in the body. Chemotherapy can affect these cells as well. Chemotherapy can produce side effects in some, but not all, people. Different chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Possible side effects include''Most are often temporary and can be treated or managed. Normal cells can usually repair the damage over time and these side effects go away once chemotherapy is completed. People may also have late effects from chemotherapy. These are side effects that are still present after six months of chemotherapy or side effects that begin years later.\xa0Late effects\xa0are not common and any risk is outweighed by the benefits of chemotherapy.' Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation (often due to antinausea medication) Tiredness Anemia Mouth sores or ulcers Increased risk of infection Increased risk of bruising Hair loss Muscle weakness Skin sensitivity to sunlight (specific drugs only) Dry or tired eyes Changes in appetite Thinking and memory changes Pain and sores at site of injection Heart damage Lung damage"
What is ataxia?,"'Ataxia'' describes the lack of muscle coordination when a voluntary movement is attempted. It may affect any motion that requires muscles to work together to perform a function, from ''walking'' to picking up an object to swallowing.''Ataxia is a sign of an underlying medical problem and is not a disease.' "
What are the types of ataxia?,"'The cerebellum is the region of the brain that is responsible for coordinating motion in the body. When the brain commands part of the body to move, electrical signals are transmitted through the spinal cord into peripheral nerves that then stimulate a muscle to contract, initiating movement.''That part of the body also has sensory nerves that collect information from the environment about position and proprioception, where the body is in time and space. These signals return via the same peripheral nerves but through a different pathway in the spinal cord.''The cerebellum takes this information, as well as input from vision from the eyes and balance from the ''vestibular system'' of the inner ear, to help smooth out purposeful movement. Failure of any one or more of these pathway components can lead to ataxia.''Cerebellar ataxia is caused by abnormalities and damage, either temporary or permanent, to the cerebellum. Sensory ataxia occurs when the dorsal columns of the spinal cord fail to function normally. They are responsible for carrying proprioception information from the body to the brain.''Damage to parts of the brain that have to interpret the information may also cause sensory ataxia. ''Vestibular'' ataxia describes loss of balance because the ''vestibular'' canals fail to function properly.'  "
What are the causes of ataxia?,"'Ataxia maybe ''inherited'' and caused by a genetic defect or it may be acquired due to structural damage to the cerebellum or spinal cord.''Genetic ataxia may be sex linked, meaning that the DNA and gene problem is located on an X or Y chromosome (the sex chromosomes) or it may be autosomal linked, where the abnormality is located on one of the other 23 pairs of chromosomes.''Spinocerebellar and episodic ataxias are examples of autosomal dominant ataxias. Friedreich ataxia and ''ataxia telangiectasia'' are autosomal recessive.''Structural damage to the brain may be caused by any lesion that decreases blood supply to or invades into brain tissue, cerebellum included. This may include ''trauma'' and bleeding, ''stroke'' or ''tumor'', and ''multiple sclerosis''.''Poisonings, chemical, ''electrolyte'', hormonal abnormalities, and malnutrition are also potential causes that tend to globally affect brain and body function and may or may not be reversible. ''Alcohol'' is perhaps the most common poisoning to cause ataxia. Other causes include a variety of prescription medications including ''lithium'' and those medications used to treat ''seizure disorders''. Recreational ''drugs'' like PCP, ketamine, and ''marijuana'' may cause ataxia. ''Mercury poisoning'' may cause ataxia. Vitamin B12 deficiency and ''hypothyroidism'' are other potential causes.'""Wilson's disease is autosomal recessive affecting the body's ability to metabolize copper and may lead to ataxia. It is an example of why classifying ataxia is sometimes difficult, since it is both a genetic and structural cause.""'There are a group of patients with ataxia where the cause is not found and this ataxia is classified as idiopathic ataxia.''Celiac disease'' is an immune-mediated illness and is often thought only as a digestive disorder where the body cannot digest ''gluten''. However, it may affect many other organs in the body. Gluten-associated ataxia may be one of the causes of sporadic idiopathic ataxia.'  "
What are the ataxia symptoms?,"'The symptoms of ataxia will depend upon what part of the brain or body is affected. Common symptoms all involve lack of coordination:'   Difficulty walking with an unsteady gait, which is often wide-based and staggering. This can lead to stumbling and falling. Speech may be slurred and slow with an unusual rhythm to the words. Swallowing may be difficult and the patient may choke, especially when drinking liquids. Difficulty using the hands and fingers to button shirts, or pick up a fork or spoon to eat. Writing, keyboarding, sewing, and playing an instrument can be affected. Nystagmus is the term used to describe rapid involuntary eye movements where the eyes jerk back and forth. This can cause blurred vision and difficulty reading or moving the eyes from one word to the next. Fatigue is a common complaint, likely because the muscles of the body have to work harder to overcome the lack of coordination to perform their daily activities."
How is ataxia diagnosed?,"'History and physical examination are necessary for the clinical diagnosis of the disease process that results in ataxia. Questions may be asked about exposures to chemicals and other toxins. History may include delving into the family history asking about relatives who might have neurologic problems. The neurologic exam will be focused upon looking for muscle ''weakness'' and changes in sensation.''Laboratory tests (blood, urine, ''lumbar puncture'') may look for electrolyte and chemical abnormalities and may screen for toxins and other poisons. ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' of the brain and spinal cord may be required. Nerve conduction studies may be appropriate if there is concern for ''peripheral neuropathy'' (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord). If there is a potential for a familial or genetic cause, genetic testing may be appropriate.''There are many potential causes for ataxia and it may take time for a definitive diagnosis to be made. The primary health care professional may ask for consultation from an internal medicine specialist or ''neurologist'' to help identify the definitive diagnosis or underlying cause of the ataxia.' "
What is the treatment for ataxia?,"'The treatment of ataxia depends upon the underlying cause. Should the ataxia be found to be irreversible, physical and occupational therapy are the cornerstones of care, focusing on safety, mobility, maximizing function, and improving quality of life.'  "
What is the prognosis for ataxia?,"'Ataxia is the sign of an underlying disease or illness and the prognosis depends upon the response to treatment of that underlying cause. For example, some causes of ataxia may be reversible (electrolyte imbalance, exposure to certain chemicals) so the prognosis is good while others (genetic, irreversible alcohol damage) may have a fair to poor prognosis.'  "
Can ataxia be prevented?,"'Since ataxia is the sign of an underlying disease, it may not necessarily be preventable. However, avoiding external causes of ataxia (environmental chemicals and toxins) may prevent some individuals from developing ataxia. Currently, genetic causes are not preventable.' "
What is athlete's foot? What are causes and risk factors of athlete's foot?,"""Athlete's foot is a term given to almost any inflammatory skin disease that affects the sole of the foot and the skin between the toes. It is usually scaly and may be a red, raw-appearing eruption with weeping and oozing with small ""'blisters''. It affects the feet of athletes and non-athletes alike. Although it is frequently caused by a fungal infection, other causes may be indistinguishable without proper testing.'""The medical name for fungal athlete's foot is ""'tinea pedis'"". There are a variety of fungi that cause athlete's foot, and these can be contracted in many locations, including gyms, locker rooms, ""'swimming'' pools, communal showers, nail salons, and from contaminated socks and clothing. The fungi can also be spread directly from person to person by contact. Most people acquire fungus on the feet from walking barefoot in areas where someone else with athlete\'s foot has recently walked. Some people are simply more prone to this condition while others seem relatively resistant to it. Another colorful name for this condition is ""jungle rot,"" often used by members of the armed services serving in tropical climates.'""Fungal infections are promoted by warmth and moisture. There is some speculation that before enclosed shoes became common, tinea pedis was less prevalent. Up to 70% of the population may develop athlete's foot at some time. An infection by athlete's foot fungi does not confer any resistance to subsequent infections."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of athlete's foot?,"""Many individuals with athlete's foot have no symptoms at all and do not even know they have an infection. Many may think they simply have ""'dry skin'"" on the soles of their feet. Common symptoms of athlete's foot typically include various degrees of ""'itching'', stinging, and burning. The skin may frequently peel, and in particularly severe cases, there may be some cracking, fissuring, ''pain'"", and itching in the toe webs. Occasionally, athlete's foot can ""'blister''.'  "
What does athlete's foot look like?,"""Fungal athlete's foot may cause a ""'rash'' on one or both feet and even involve the hand. A ""two feet and one hand"" pattern is a very common presentation of athlete\'s foot, especially in men. Hand fungal infections are called tinea manuum. Fungal athlete\'s foot may also be seen along with ''ringworm'' of the groin (especially in men) or hand(s). It is helpful to examine the feet whenever there is a fungal groin ''rash'' called ''tinea cruris'', or ''jock itch'"". It is important to treat all areas of fungal infection at one time to avoid reinfection. Simply treating the soles and ignoring the concurrent fungal infection of toenails may result in recurrences of athlete's foot."" "
Is athlete's foot contagious?,"""If athlete's foot is caused by a fungus, it is potentially contagious. Some people do not develop infection of the skin after exposure to the fungus. The exact cause of resistance or susceptibility to fungal infections is unknown."" "
What else causes foot rashes?,"'There are many possible causes of foot ''rashes''. Additional causes include irritant or ''contact dermatitis'', ''allergic'' ''rashes'' from shoes or other creams, pompholyx (''dyshidrotic eczema''), ''psoriasis'', yeast infections, and ''bacterial infections'' (gram negative toe web infection and erythrasma). Since these conditions are often indistinguishable on superficial visual examination, it is important for your doctor to do his best to identify the precise cause. Since fungal infections are potentially curable, it is important not to miss this diagnosis.''Your physician may perform a simple test called a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation for microscopic fungal examination in the office or laboratory. This test can be used to confirm the presence of a fungal infection. This test is performed by using a microscope to examine small flakes of skin from the rash. Many dermatologists perform this test in their office with results available within minutes. Rarely, a small piece of skin may be removed and sent for biopsy or fungal culture to help confirm the diagnosis.'  "
What are risk factors for athlete's foot?,"'Walking barefoot in wet, dark areas frequented by many other individuals like indoor swimming pool decks, communal showers, and locker rooms result in frequent exposure to pathogenic fungi (dermatophytes) that cause athlete’s foot. Wearing occlusive footwear is thought to play a significant role in the increased frequency of tinea pedis. Exposure to moisture either from ''excessive sweating'' or from an external source is a risk factor. Wearing the same shoes and socks for an extended period may damage the skin. Patients with ''diabetes'' are predisposed to develop tinea pedis. Some believe that ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') can predispose one to tinea pedis. It appears that many more men have tinea pedis than women. ''Pedicure'' performed in contaminated environments can spread disease.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose athlete's foot?,"""The most reliable way to diagnose athlete’s foot is to correctly identify its cause. Fungal athlete's foot is relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. Visualization of the fungus in skin scrapings removed from the affected areas of the feet is a painless and cost-effective method for diagnosis. Rarely, it is necessary to identify fungi in portions of skin removed during a biopsy. If no fungus is found, other causes of athlete's foot must be investigated."" "
What is the treatment for athlete's foot?,"'Since there is no single cause for athlete’s foot there is no single treatment. Nevertheless, all causes of this condition benefit by promoting a dry, clean, and friction-free environment for the feet.''Occlusive shoe materials, such as vinyl, which cause the feet to remain moist, provide an excellent area for the fungus to proliferate. Likewise, absorbent socks like cotton that wick water away from your feet may help. Some individuals who sweat excessively benefit from the application of antiperspirants like 20% aluminum chloride (''Drysol'""). Powders can help keep your feet dry. Although counterintuitive, if your feet can be soaked in a solution of aluminum acetate (Burow's solution or ""'Domeboro'' solution) and then air dried with a fan, this can be very helpful if performed three or four times within 30 minutes. A home remedy of dilute white vinegar soaks, using one part vinegar and roughly four parts water, once or twice a day (as 10-minute foot soaks) may aid in treatment followed by evaporation can be helpful.''For fungus infection, there are plenty of options. Many medications are available, including ''miconazole'' (''Micatin'', Zeasorb powder), econazole (Spectazole), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil''), naftifine (''Naftin''), butenafine (''Mentax''), ''ciclopirox'' (''Loprox''), ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''), ''efinaconazole'' (''Jublia''), luliconazole (Luzu), sertaconazole (Ertaczo), sulconazole (Exelderm), and tolnaftate (Tinactin). Ask your health care professional or pharmacist for a recommendation. It is difficult to know which of these ''drugs'"" is most effective since they have not been tested against each other. Cost is probably the most significant differentiating factor, and many are available without a prescription. Treatment for athlete's foot should generally be continued for four weeks or at least one week after all of the skin symptoms have cleared.""""More advanced or resistant cases of athlete's foot may require a course of an oral (pill) antifungal like terbinafine (Lamisil), ""'itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''), or ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''). Laboratory blood tests to make sure there is no ''liver disease'' may be required before taking these pills.''Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams can act as a ""fertilizer"" for fungus and may actually worsen fungal skin infections by suppressing the body\'s immune defenses. These topical steroid medications have no role in treating fungal foot infections but can be quite effective in treating noninfectious causes of athlete’s foot.'""If the fungal infection has spread to the toenails, the nails must also be treated to avoid reinfection of the feet. Often, the nails are initially ignored only to find the athlete's foot keeps recurring. It is important to treat all of the visible fungus at the same time. Effective ""'nail fungus'' treatment may be more intensive and require prolonged courses (three to four months) of oral antifungal medications.' "
What home remedies are available for athlete's foot?,"'Multiple home remedies are available, including vinegar soaks, dilute Clorox soaks, and shampoos like Head & Shoulders or ''Selsun Blue''. Other reported but unverified remedies have included Vicks Vapor Rub and Epsom salts.' Dilute vinegar soaks or sprays (roughly one part white household vinegar to four parts water) Dilute Clorox baths or soaks (approximately ¼ cup household Clorox bleach in one bathtub of water)"
How can I treat athlete's foot in pregnancy?,'Treatment options during ''pregnancy'' may include dilute vinegar soaks or sprays (roughly one part white household vinegar to four parts water) and Lotrimin cream twice a day for two to three weeks to the soles. Antifungal pills are generally not recommended during pregnancy because of the potential side effects and possible fetal harm. Always check with your OB/GYN before using any medication or treatment during pregnancy.' 
When should someone seek medical care for athlete's foot?,"'If you notice any redness, increased swelling, bleeding, or if your infection is not clearing up, see your health care professional. If a bacterial infection is also occurring, an antibiotic pill may be necessary. If you have fungal nail involvement, are diabetic, or have a compromised immune system, you should also see your physician for treatment.' "
What are possible complications of athlete's foot?,"""Untreated, fungal athlete's foot can potentially spread to other body parts or other people, including family members. Fungus may spread locally to the legs, toenails, hands, fingernails, and essentially any body area.""'This type of fungus generally likes to live in the skin, hair, and nails.

What is athlete's foot? What are causes and risk factors of athlete's foot?,"""Athlete's foot is a term given to almost any inflammatory skin disease that affects the sole of the foot and the skin between the toes. It is usually scaly and may be a red, raw-appearing eruption with weeping and oozing with small ""'blisters''. It affects the feet of athletes and non-athletes alike. Although it is frequently caused by a fungal infection, other causes may be indistinguishable without proper testing.'""The medical name for fungal athlete's foot is ""'tinea pedis'"". There are a variety of fungi that cause athlete's foot, and these can be contracted in many locations, including gyms, locker rooms, ""'swimming'' pools, communal showers, nail salons, and from contaminated socks and clothing. The fungi can also be spread directly from person to person by contact. Most people acquire fungus on the feet from walking barefoot in areas where someone else with athlete\'s foot has recently walked. Some people are simply more prone to this condition while others seem relatively resistant to it. Another colorful name for this condition is ""jungle rot,"" often used by members of the armed services serving in tropical climates.'""Fungal infections are promoted by warmth and moisture. There is some speculation that before enclosed shoes became common, tinea pedis was less prevalent. Up to 70% of the population may develop athlete's foot at some time. An infection by athlete's foot fungi does not confer any resistance to subsequent infections."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of athlete's foot?,"""Many individuals with athlete's foot have no symptoms at all and do not even know they have an infection. Many may think they simply have ""'dry skin'"" on the soles of their feet. Common symptoms of athlete's foot typically include various degrees of ""'itching'', stinging, and burning. The skin may frequently peel, and in particularly severe cases, there may be some cracking, fissuring, ''pain'"", and itching in the toe webs. Occasionally, athlete's foot can ""'blister''.'  "
What does athlete's foot look like?,"""Fungal athlete's foot may cause a ""'rash'' on one or both feet and even involve the hand. A ""two feet and one hand"" pattern is a very common presentation of athlete\'s foot, especially in men. Hand fungal infections are called tinea manuum. Fungal athlete\'s foot may also be seen along with ''ringworm'' of the groin (especially in men) or hand(s). It is helpful to examine the feet whenever there is a fungal groin ''rash'' called ''tinea cruris'', or ''jock itch'"". It is important to treat all areas of fungal infection at one time to avoid reinfection. Simply treating the soles and ignoring the concurrent fungal infection of toenails may result in recurrences of athlete's foot."" "
Is athlete's foot contagious?,"""If athlete's foot is caused by a fungus, it is potentially contagious. Some people do not develop infection of the skin after exposure to the fungus. The exact cause of resistance or susceptibility to fungal infections is unknown."" "
What else causes foot rashes?,"'There are many possible causes of foot ''rashes''. Additional causes include irritant or ''contact dermatitis'', ''allergic'' ''rashes'' from shoes or other creams, pompholyx (''dyshidrotic eczema''), ''psoriasis'', yeast infections, and ''bacterial infections'' (gram negative toe web infection and erythrasma). Since these conditions are often indistinguishable on superficial visual examination, it is important for your doctor to do his best to identify the precise cause. Since fungal infections are potentially curable, it is important not to miss this diagnosis.''Your physician may perform a simple test called a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation for microscopic fungal examination in the office or laboratory. This test can be used to confirm the presence of a fungal infection. This test is performed by using a microscope to examine small flakes of skin from the rash. Many dermatologists perform this test in their office with results available within minutes. Rarely, a small piece of skin may be removed and sent for biopsy or fungal culture to help confirm the diagnosis.'  "
What are risk factors for athlete's foot?,"'Walking barefoot in wet, dark areas frequented by many other individuals like indoor swimming pool decks, communal showers, and locker rooms result in frequent exposure to pathogenic fungi (dermatophytes) that cause athlete’s foot. Wearing occlusive footwear is thought to play a significant role in the increased frequency of tinea pedis. Exposure to moisture either from ''excessive sweating'' or from an external source is a risk factor. Wearing the same shoes and socks for an extended period may damage the skin. Patients with ''diabetes'' are predisposed to develop tinea pedis. Some believe that ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') can predispose one to tinea pedis. It appears that many more men have tinea pedis than women. ''Pedicure'' performed in contaminated environments can spread disease.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose athlete's foot?,"""The most reliable way to diagnose athlete’s foot is to correctly identify its cause. Fungal athlete's foot is relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. Visualization of the fungus in skin scrapings removed from the affected areas of the feet is a painless and cost-effective method for diagnosis. Rarely, it is necessary to identify fungi in portions of skin removed during a biopsy. If no fungus is found, other causes of athlete's foot must be investigated."" "
What is the treatment for athlete's foot?,"'Since there is no single cause for athlete’s foot there is no single treatment. Nevertheless, all causes of this condition benefit by promoting a dry, clean, and friction-free environment for the feet.''Occlusive shoe materials, such as vinyl, which cause the feet to remain moist, provide an excellent area for the fungus to proliferate. Likewise, absorbent socks like cotton that wick water away from your feet may help. Some individuals who sweat excessively benefit from the application of antiperspirants like 20% aluminum chloride (''Drysol'""). Powders can help keep your feet dry. Although counterintuitive, if your feet can be soaked in a solution of aluminum acetate (Burow's solution or ""'Domeboro'' solution) and then air dried with a fan, this can be very helpful if performed three or four times within 30 minutes. A home remedy of dilute white vinegar soaks, using one part vinegar and roughly four parts water, once or twice a day (as 10-minute foot soaks) may aid in treatment followed by evaporation can be helpful.''For fungus infection, there are plenty of options. Many medications are available, including ''miconazole'' (''Micatin'', Zeasorb powder), econazole (Spectazole), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil''), naftifine (''Naftin''), butenafine (''Mentax''), ''ciclopirox'' (''Loprox''), ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''), ''efinaconazole'' (''Jublia''), luliconazole (Luzu), sertaconazole (Ertaczo), sulconazole (Exelderm), and tolnaftate (Tinactin). Ask your health care professional or pharmacist for a recommendation. It is difficult to know which of these ''drugs'"" is most effective since they have not been tested against each other. Cost is probably the most significant differentiating factor, and many are available without a prescription. Treatment for athlete's foot should generally be continued for four weeks or at least one week after all of the skin symptoms have cleared.""""More advanced or resistant cases of athlete's foot may require a course of an oral (pill) antifungal like terbinafine (Lamisil), ""'itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''), or ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''). Laboratory blood tests to make sure there is no ''liver disease'' may be required before taking these pills.''Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams can act as a ""fertilizer"" for fungus and may actually worsen fungal skin infections by suppressing the body\'s immune defenses. These topical steroid medications have no role in treating fungal foot infections but can be quite effective in treating noninfectious causes of athlete’s foot.'""If the fungal infection has spread to the toenails, the nails must also be treated to avoid reinfection of the feet. Often, the nails are initially ignored only to find the athlete's foot keeps recurring. It is important to treat all of the visible fungus at the same time. Effective ""'nail fungus'' treatment may be more intensive and require prolonged courses (three to four months) of oral antifungal medications.' "
What home remedies are available for athlete's foot?,"'Multiple home remedies are available, including vinegar soaks, dilute Clorox soaks, and shampoos like Head & Shoulders or ''Selsun Blue''.

How can I treat athlete's foot in pregnancy?,'Treatment options during ''pregnancy'' may include dilute vinegar soaks or sprays (roughly one part white household vinegar to four parts water) and Lotrimin cream twice a day for two to three weeks to the soles. Antifungal pills are generally not recommended during pregnancy because of the potential side effects and possible fetal harm. Always check with your OB/GYN before using any medication or treatment during pregnancy.' 
When should someone seek medical care for athlete's foot?,"'If you notice any redness, increased swelling, bleeding, or if your infection is not clearing up, see your health care professional. If a bacterial infection is also occurring, an antibiotic pill may be necessary. If you have fungal nail involvement, are diabetic, or have a compromised immune system, you should also see your physician for treatment.' "

What is atopic dermatitis?,"""Atopic dermatitis is a common, often persistent skin disease that affects a large percentage of the world's population. Atopy is a special type of ""'allergic'' hypersensitivity that is associated with ''asthma'', ''inhalant'' ''allergies'' (''hay fever''), and a chronic dermatitis. There is a known hereditary component of the disease, and it is more common in affected families. Criteria that enable a doctor to diagnose it include the typical appearance and distribution of the ''rash'' in a patient with a personal or family history of ''asthma'' and/or hay ''fever''. The term ''atopic'' is from the Greek meaning ""strange."" The term ''dermatitis'' means inflammation of the skin. Many physicians and patients use the term ''eczema'' when they are referring to this condition. Sometimes it is called neurodermatitis.''In atopic dermatitis, the skin becomes extremely ''itchy'' and inflamed, causing redness, swelling, vesicle formation (minute ''blisters''), cracking, weeping, crusting, and scaling. This type of eruption is termed eczematous. In addition, ''dry skin'' is a very common complaint in almost all those afflicted with atopic dermatitis.''Although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age, most often it affects infants and young children. Occasionally, it may persist into adulthood or may rarely appear at that time. Some patients tend to have a protracted course with ups and downs. In most cases, there are periods of time when the disease is worse, called exacerbations or flares, which are followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely, called remissions. Many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission of the disease when they get older, although their skin may remain somewhat dry and easily irritated.''Multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis, including low humidity, seasonal ''allergies'', exposure to harsh soaps and detergents, and ''cold'' weather. Environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time in the lives of individuals who have inherited the atopic disease trait.'  "
How common is atopic dermatitis?," Atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and increasing in prevalence. It affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). Atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children, and its onset decreases substantially with age. Of those affected, 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life, and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. Onset after age 30 is uncommon and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. People who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. About 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. Roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood. This means that more than 15 million people in the United States have symptoms of the disease."
What are the symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis?,"'Although symptoms and signs may vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.' Itch is the hallmark of the disease. Typically, affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face, and neck. The itchiness is an important factor in atopic dermatitis, because scratching and rubbing can worsen the skin inflammation that is characteristic of this disease. People with atopic dermatitis seem to be more sensitive to itching and feel the need to scratch longer in response. They develop what is referred to as the ""itch-scratch"" cycle. The extreme itchiness of the skin causes the person to scratch, which in turn worsens the itch, and so on. Itching is particularly a problem during sleep, when conscious control of scratching decreases and the absence of other outside stimuli makes the itchiness more noticeable."
What are the causes and risk factors of atopic dermatitis?,"'The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known, but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors. There seems to be a basic cutaneous hypersensitivity and an increased tendency toward itching. Evidence suggests that the disease is associated with other so-called atopic disorders such as hay ''fever'' (seasonal ''allergies'') and ''asthma'', which many people with atopic dermatitis also have.' In addition, many children who outgrow the symptoms of atopic dermatitis go on to develop hay fever or asthma. Although one disorder does not necessarily cause another, they may be related, thereby giving researchers clues to understanding atopic dermatitis. Many of those affected seem to have either a decreased quantity of or a defective form of a protein called filaggrin in their skin. This protein seem to be important in maintaining normal cutaneous hydration. It is important to understand that food sensitivities do not seem to be a major inciting factor for most cases of atopic dermatitis. This is an area of active research. Patients with atopic dermatitis seem to have mild immune system weakness. They are predisposed to develop fungal foot disease and cutaneous staphylococcal infections, and they can disseminate herpes simplex lip infections (eczema herpeticum) and smallpox vaccination (eczema vaccinatum) to large areas of skin. While emotional factors and stress may sometimes exacerbate the condition, they do not seem to be a primary or underlying cause for the disorder."
Can atopic dermatitis affect the face?,"'Yes. Atopic dermatitis may affect the skin around the eyes, the eyelids, the eyebrows, and lashes. Scratching and rubbing the eye area can cause the skin to change in appearance. Some people with atopic dermatitis develop an extra fold of skin under their eyes, called an atopic pleat or Dennie-Morgan fold. Other people may have hyperpigmented eyelids, meaning that the skin on their eyelids darkens from the inflammation or hay fever (allergic shiners). Patchy eyebrows and eyelashes may also result from scratching or rubbing.''The face is very commonly affected in ''babies'', who may drool excessively, and become irritated from skin contact with their abundant saliva.''The skin of a person with atopic dermatitis loses excessive moisture from the epidermal layer. Some patients with atopic dermatitis lack a protein called filaggrin that is important in retaining moisture. This defective genetic trait allows the skin to become very dry, which reduces its protective abilities. In addition, the skin is very susceptible to infectious disorders, such as staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial skin infections, ''warts'', herpes simplex, and ''molluscum contagiosum'' (which is caused by a virus).' Lichenification: thick, leathery skin resulting from constant scratching and rubbing Lichen simplex: refers to a thickened patch of raised skin that results from repeat rubbing and scratching of the same skin area Papules: small, raised bumps that may open when scratched, becoming crusty and infected Ichthyosis: dry, rectangular scales on the skin, commonly on the lower legs and shins Keratosis pilaris: small, rough bumps, generally on the face, upper arms, and thighs. These are also described as gooseflesh or chicken skin and may have a small coiled hair under each bump. Hyper-linear palms: increased number of skin creases on the palms Urticaria: hives (red, raised bumps), often after exposure to an allergen, at the beginning of flare-ups, or after exercise or a hot bath Cheilitis: inflammation of the skin on and around the lips Atopic pleat (Dennie-Morgan fold): an extra fold of skin that develops under the eye Dark circles under the eyes: may result from allergies and atopy Hyperpigmented eyelids: scaling eyelids that have become darker in color from inflammation or hay fever Prurigo nodules also called ""picker's warts"" are not really warts at all. These are small thickened bumps of skin caused by repeated picking of the same skin site."
Is atopic dermatitis contagious?,"'No. Atopic dermatitis itself is definitely not ''contagious'', and it cannot be passed from one person to another through skin contact. There is generally no cause for concern in being around someone with even an active case of atopic dermatitis, unless they have active skin infections.''Some patients with atopic dermatitis get secondary infections of their skin with ''Staphylococcus'' (""''staph''""), other bacteria, herpes virus (''cold sores''), and less commonly yeasts and other ''fungal infections''. These infections may be contagious through skin contact.' "
Atopic dermatitis vs. eczema,"'Eczema'' is a nonspecific term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis). There are different categories of ''eczema'', which include allergic, contact, irritant, and ''nummular eczema'', which can be difficult to distinguish from atopic dermatitis. These types of eczema are listed and briefly described below.''Atopy is a medical syndrome that includes three associated conditions that tend to occur in the same individual: atopic dermatitis, inhalant allergies, and asthma. All three components need not be present in the same individual simultaneously.' Contact eczema: a localized reaction that includes redness, itching, and burning where the skin has come into direct contact with an irritant such as an acid, a cleaning agent, or other chemical Allergic contact eczema: a red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy or certain chemicals or antibiotics in creams and lotions like neomycin (Neosporin) or bacitracin (Baciguent) Seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea) is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish, oily, scaly patches of skin on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally other parts of the body. Often this is also called dandruff in adults or ""cradle cap"" in infants. Nummular eczema: coin-shaped (round), isolated patches of irritated skin -- most commonly on the arms and lower legs -- that may be crusted, scaling, and extremely itchy Lichen simplex chronicus (localized neurodermatitis): a dermatitis localized to a particular anatomical area induced by long-term rubbing, scratching, or picking the skin. The underlying cause may be a sensitivity or irritation that sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. It may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks. Areas of thickened plaques form on the skin of the neck, shins, wrists, or forearms. This condition has certain similarities to calluses, and it will resolve if the patient stops irritating the area. Stasis dermatitis: a skin irritation on the lower legs, generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. It may have a darker pigmentation, light-brown, or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. It's sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins. Dyshidrotic eczema or pompholyx: irritation of the skin on the palms of hands (mostly) and less commonly soles of the feet characterized by clear, very deep-seated blisters that itch and burn. It's sometimes described as a ""tapioca pudding""-like rash on the palms. Xerotic eczema: areas of very dry skin most often seen on the lower legs of the elderly"
What are the stages of atopic dermatitis?,"'Atopic dermatitis seems to have a differing pattern of involvement depending on the age of a patient.''In infants, atopic dermatitis typically begins around 6 to 12 weeks of age.''In childhood, the rash tends to occur behind the knees and inside the elbows, on the sides of the neck, and on the wrists, ankles, and hands.''In those with more heavily pigmented skin, especially the face, areas of lighter skin color appear. This condition is called pityriasis alba. It is usually self-limited and the color will eventually normalize.''The disease may go into remission (disease-free period) for months or even years.' It may first appear around the cheeks and chin as a patchy facial rash, which can progress to red, scaling, oozing skin. The skin may become infected. Once the infant becomes more mobile and begins crawling, exposed areas such as the knees and elbows may also be affected. An infant with atopic dermatitis may be restless and irritable because of the itching and discomfort. Many infants improve by 18 months of age, although they remain at greater than normal risk for dry skin or hand eczema later in life. Often, the rash begins with papules that become hard and scaly when scratched. The skin around the lips may be inflamed, and constant licking of the area may lead to small, painful cracks. Severe eczema cases may affect growth, and the child may be shorter than average. In most children, the disease disappears after puberty. Although a number of people who developed atopic dermatitis as children also experience symptoms as adults, it is less common for the disease to show up first in adulthood. The pattern in adults is similar to that seen in children; that is, the disease may be widespread or limited. In some adults, only the hands or feet may be affected and become dry, itchy, red, and cracked. Sleep patterns and work performance may be affected, and long-term use of medications to treat the condition may cause complications. Adults with atopic dermatitis also have a predisposition toward irritant contact dermatitis, especially if they are in occupations involving frequent hand wetting, hand washing, or exposure to chemicals. Some people develop a rash around their nipples. These localized symptoms are difficult to treat, and people often do not tell their doctor because of modesty or embarrassment. Adults may also develop cataracts that are difficult to detect because they cause no symptoms. Therefore, the doctor may recommend regular eye exams."
Which types of doctors treat atopic dermatitis?,"'Pediatricians, allergists, and dermatologists care for most patients with atopic dermatitis.' "
What tests diagnose atopic dermatitis?,"'The diagnosis is made on the physical examination and visual inspection of the skin. The personal history of inhalant allergies and family history will often support the diagnosis. Although itching is necessary but not sufficient to diagnose atopic dermatitis, consideration of other itchy eruptions is often necessary.''A ''skin biopsy'' (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) is rarely helpful to establish the diagnosis. Many patients with severe atopic disease may have elevated numbers of a certain type of white blood cells (eosinophils) and/or elevated serum IgE level. These tests can support the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, skin swab (long cotton tip applicator or Q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude staphylococcal infections of the skin, which may complicate atopic dermatitis.''Skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis. Positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate.''Major features''Some minor features' Itching Characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) Chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms Personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema, hay fever, asthma) Early age of onset Dry, rough skin High levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody, in the blood Ichthyosis Hyper linear palms Keratosis pilaris Hand or foot dermatitis Cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) Nipple eczema Susceptibility to skin infection Positive allergy skin tests"
How can you prevent and avoid aggravating factors for atopic dermatitis?,"'Patients with atopic dermatitis should limit exposure to environmental and chemical factors known to cause exacerbations. These include dry skin, quick changes in temperature, the low humidity encountered during cold weather, and wool clothing.' "
What are skin irritants for atopic dermatitis?,"'Irritants are substances that directly damage the skin, and when used in high enough concentrations for long enough, cause the skin to become inflamed. Soaps, detergents, and even water may produce inflammation. Some perfumes and ''cosmetics'' may irritate the skin. Chlorine and alcoholic solvents, dust, or sand may also aggravate the condition. ''Cigarette'' smoke may irritate the eyelids.' Wool or synthetic fibers Soaps and detergents Some perfumes and cosmetics Substances such as chlorine, mineral oil, or solvents Dust or sand Dust mites Cigarette smoke Animal fur or dander Flowers and pollen"
What food allergies trigger atopic dermatitis?,"'Allergens are substances from foods, plants, or animals that provoke an overreaction of the immune system and cause inflammation (in this case, the skin). The importance of ''food allergy'' in atopic dermatitis is controversial. Although not all researchers agree, most experts think that ''breastfeeding'' the infant for at least four months may have a protective effect for the child. New lines of evidence even support exposing young children to normal environmental contaminants such as peanuts. Although such exposures may prevent the development of atopic dermatitis, there is no consensus on how to prevent the development of atopic diseases.''If a ''food allergy'' is suspected, it may be helpful to keep a careful diary of everything the patient eats, noting any reactions. Identifying the food allergen may be difficult and require supervision by an allergist if the patient is also being exposed to other allergens. One helpful way to explore the possibility of a food ''allergy'' is to eliminate the suspected food and then, if improvement is noticed, reintroduce it into the ''diet'' under carefully controlled conditions. A two-week trial is usually sufficient for each food. If the food being tested causes no symptoms after two weeks, a different food can be tested in like manner afterward. Likewise, if the elimination of a food does not result in improvement after two weeks, other foods may be eliminated in turn.''Changing the ''diet'"" of a person who has atopic dermatitis may not always relieve symptoms. A change may be helpful, however, when a patient's medical history and specific symptoms strongly suggest a food ""'allergy''. It is up to the patient and his or her family and physician to judge whether the dietary restrictions outweigh the impact of the disease itself. Restricted diets often are emotionally and financially difficult for patients and their families to follow. Unless properly monitored, diets with many restrictions can also contribute to nutritional problems in children.' "
What are aeroallergens?,"'Some allergens are called aeroallergens because they are present in the air. They may also play a role in atopic dermatitis.'""No reliable test is available that determines whether a specific aeroallergen is an exacerbating factor in any given individual. If the doctor suspects that an aeroallergen is contributing to a patient's symptoms, the doctor may recommend ways to reduce exposure to the offending agents. For example, the presence of the house dust ""'mite'' can be limited by encasing mattresses and pillows in special dust-proof covers, frequently washing bedding in hot water, and removing carpeting. However, there is no way to completely rid the environment of aeroallergens.' Common aeroallergens are dust mites, pollens, molds, and dander from animal hair or skin. These aeroallergens, particularly the house dust mite, may worsen the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in some people. Although some researchers think that aeroallergens are an important contributing factor to atopic dermatitis, others believe that they are insignificant."
What are home remedies for atopic dermatitis?,"""Treatment involves a partnership between the doctor and the patient and family members. The doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on the patient's age, symptoms, and general health. The patient and family members play a large role in the success of the treatment plan by carefully following the doctor's instructions. Some of the primary components of treatment programs are described below. Most patients can be successfully managed with proper ""'skin care'' and lifestyle changes and do not require the more intensive treatments discussed.''Skin care'': A simple and basic regimen is key. Staying with one recommended soap and one moisturizer is very important. Using multiple soaps, lotions, fragrances, and mixes of products may cause further issues and skin sensitivity.'""Healing the skin and keeping it healthy are of primary importance both in preventing further damage and enhancing the patient's quality of life. Developing and following a daily skin care routine is critical to preventing recurrent episodes of symptoms. The key factor is proper bathing and the application of an emollient to the wet skin without towel drying. Generally, an effective emollient is a reasonably stiff ointment or cream (one that does not move out of an opened inverted jar). People with atopic dermatitis should avoid hot baths and showers. A lukewarm bleach bath with a capful of chlorine bleach (Clorox) helps to cleanse and disinfect the skin. The doctor may recommend limited use of a mild bar soap or non-soap cleanser because soaps can be drying to the skin. Oatmeal baths are often helpful. Red, irritated areas can be treated with 1% hydrocortisone cream (two to three times a day), which can be obtained at most pharmacies and does not require a physician's prescription.""""Once the bathing is finished, apply an emollient immediately without towel drying. This restores the skin's moisture and inhibits the evaporation of water, increasing the rate of healing, and establishing a barrier against further drying and irritation. Lotions generally are discouraged because they have a high water or ""'alcohol'' content and evaporate quickly. Creams and ointments work better at healing the skin. Tar preparations can be very helpful in healing very dry, lichenified areas. Whatever preparation is chosen, it should be as free of fragrances and chemicals as possible.''Another key to protecting and restoring the skin is taking steps to avoid repeated skin infections. Although it may not be possible to avoid infections altogether, the effects of an infection may be minimized if they are identified and treated early. Patients and their families should learn to recognize the signs of skin infections, including tiny pustules (pus-filled bumps) on the arms and legs, appearance of oozing areas, or crusty yellow blisters. If symptoms of a skin infection develop, the doctor should be consulted to begin treatment as soon as possible.'   Give lukewarm baths. Apply an emollient immediately following the bath. Keep a child's fingernails filed short. Select soft cotton fabrics when choosing clothing. Consider using antihistamines to reduce scratching at night. Keep the child cool; consider a humidifier. Learn to recognize skin infections and seek treatment promptly. Attempt to distract the child with activities to keep him or her from scratching."
What is the treatment for atopic dermatitis?,"'If the disease does not respond to mild local ''over-the-counter'' treatment then a physician is required. With proper treatment, most symptoms can be brought under control within three weeks.''Additional available treatments may help to reduce specific symptoms of the disease.''Phototherapy is treatment with light that uses ultraviolet A or B light waves or a combination of both. This treatment can be an effective treatment for mild to moderate dermatitis in older children (over 12 years old) and adults. Photochemotherapy, a combination of ultraviolet light therapy and a drug called psoralen, can also be used in cases that are resistant to phototherapy alone. Possible long-term side effects of this treatment include premature skin ''aging'' and ''skin cancer''. If the doctor thinks that phototherapy may be useful in treating the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, he or she will use the minimum exposure necessary and monitor the skin carefully.''When other treatments are not effective, the doctor may prescribe systemic ''corticosteroids'', drugs that are taken by mouth or injected into muscle instead of being applied directly to the skin. An example of a commonly prescribed corticosteroid is ''prednisone''. Typically, these medications are used only in resistant cases and are only given for short periods of time. The side effects of systemic corticosteroids can include skin damage, thinned or weakened bones, ''high blood pressure'', ''high blood sugar'', infections, and ''cataracts''. It can be dangerous to suddenly stop taking corticosteroids, so it is very important that the doctor and patient work together in changing the corticosteroid dose.''In adults, immunosuppressive drugs, such as ''cyclosporine'', are also used to treat severe cases of atopic dermatitis that have failed to respond to any other forms of therapy. Immunosuppressive drugs restrain the overactive immune system by blocking the production of some immune cells and curbing the action of others.'""In extremely rare cases, when no other treatments have been successful, the patient may have to be hospitalized. A five- to seven-day hospital stay allows intensive skin care treatment and reduces the patient's exposure to irritants, allergens, and the stresses of day-to-day life. Under these conditions, the symptoms usually clear quickly if environmental factors play a role or if the patient is not able to carry out an adequate skin care program at home.""'Despite the symptoms caused by atopic dermatitis, it is possible for people with the disorder to maintain a high quality of life. The keys to an improved quality of life are education, awareness, and developing a partnership among the patient, family, and doctor. Good communication is essential for all involved. It is important that the doctor provides understandable information about the disease and its symptoms to the patient and family and demonstrate any treatment measures recommended to ensure that they will be properly carried out.''When a child has atopic dermatitis, the entire family situation may be affected. It is important that families have additional support to help them cope with the ''stress'' and frustration associated with the disease. The child may be fussy and difficult and often is unable to keep from scratching and rubbing the skin. Distracting the child and providing as many activities that keep the hands busy are key but require effort and work on the part of the parents or caregivers. Another issue a family may face is the social and emotional stress associated with disfigurement caused by atopic dermatitis. The child may face difficulty in school or other social relationships and may need additional support and encouragement from family members.' Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments are the most frequently used treatment. Since many of these are quite potent it will be necessary to have frequent physician visits to assure that the treatment is successful. Tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are non-steroid topical ointments that contain molecules that inhibit a substance called calcineurin which is important in inflammation. They rather expensive topical medicated creams that are used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. They are particularly effective in when used on the faces of children since they seem less likely to produce atrophy. These new drugs are referred to as ""immune modulators."" Crisaborole (Eucrisa), a recently approved topical treatment for children and adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) which seems to work by inhibiting a different portion of the inflammatory cascade in skin. Dupilumab (Duxipent) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults. It is an anti-IL-4 antibody that is given by injection twice a month and shows great promise in the control of severe atopic dermatitis. A newer class of OTC (over the counter) creams have been recently developed which claim to repair and improve the skin's barrier function in both children and adults. They include Atopiclair, MimyX, and CeraVe. These creams may be used in combination with topical steroids and other emollients to help repair the overall dryness and broken skin function. Oral antibiotics to treat staphylococcal skin infections can be helpful in the face of pyoderma. Certain antihistamines that cause drowsiness can reduce nighttime scratching and allow more restful sleep when taken at bedtime. This effect can be particularly helpful for patients whose nighttime scratching aggravates the disease. If viral or fungal infections are present, the doctor may also prescribe medications to treat those infections. The side effects of cyclosporine can include high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, kidney problems, headaches, tingling or numbness, and a possible increased risk of cancer and infections. There is also a risk of relapse after the drug is discontinued. Because of their toxic side effects, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used only in severe cases and then for as short a period of time as possible. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs should be referred to a dermatologist or an allergist specializing in the care of atopic dermatitis to help identify trigger factors and alternative therapies."
What is the prognosis of atopic dermatitis? Is there a cure?," Although symptoms of atopic dermatitis can be very difficult and uncomfortable, the disease can be successfully managed. People with atopic dermatitis, as well as their families, can lead healthy, normal lives. Long-term management may include treatment with an allergist to control inhalant allergies and a dermatologist to monitor the skin care component."
What is atopic dermatitis? What is eczema?,"'Atopic dermatitis'' and ''eczema'' both refer to ''skin conditions''. ''Atopic dermatitis'' is a cause of ''eczema'', which refers to skin conditions that cause inflammation and irritation. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably.''Atopic dermatitis'' is a common chronic skin condition that results in red, inflamed, dry, and ''itchy'' skin. Other symptoms of ''atopic dermatitis'' include ''blisters'' (vesicles), skin cracking, crusting, weeping, and scaling. Atopic ''dermatitis'' can affect adults, but it is most commonly seen in ''babies'' and young children. Triggers that may cause or worsen atopic dermatitis include low humidity, ''cold'' weather, seasonal ''allergies'', and exposure to harsh soaps and detergents. Atopic dermatitis treatment involves use of moisturizers such as petroleum jelly and topical steroids to reduce inflammation and ''itching''.''Eczema'' is not a condition in itself, but a description for a group of skin diseases that cause ''skin inflammation'' and irritation. ''Eczema'' itself is not ''contagious''; however, if the blisters become infected, that infection may spread. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema. Symptoms of eczema include ''itching'' along with blisters that ooze and eventually produce crusted, thickened plaques of skin. A ''rash'' may appear on the face, wrists, hands, ''feet'', ''scalp'', or the back of the knees. Use of creams, lotions, and other moisturizers to keep the skin hydrated can help manage symptoms.' "
What causes atopic dermatitis vs. eczema?,"'The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known, but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors. There seems to be a basic cutaneous hypersensitivity and an increased tendency toward itching. Evidence suggests that the disease is associated with other so-called atopic disorders such as ''hay fever'' (seasonal ''allergies'') and ''asthma'', which many people with atopic dermatitis also have.''In addition, many children who outgrow the symptoms of atopic dermatitis go on to develop hay ''fever'' or ''asthma''.''Although one disorder does not necessarily cause another, they may be related, thereby giving researchers clues to understanding atopic dermatitis.''Many of those affected seem to have either a decreased quantity of or a defective form of a protein called filaggrin in their skin. This protein seem to be important in maintaining normal cutaneous hydration.''It is important to understand that food sensitivities do not seem to be a major inciting factor for most cases of atopic dermatitis.''This is an area of active research. Patients with atopic dermatitis seem to have mild immune system ''weakness''.''They are predisposed to develop fungal foot disease and cutaneous staphylococcal infections, and they can disseminate ''herpes'' simplex lip infections (''eczema herpeticum'') and ''smallpox'' vaccination (eczema vaccinatum) to large areas of skin.''While emotional factors and ''stress'' may sometimes exacerbate the condition, they do not seem to be a primary or underlying cause for the disorder.''There are at least 11 distinct types of skin conditions that produce eczema. In order to develop a rational treatment plan, it is important to distinguish them. This is often not easy.' Atopic dermatitis: This health condition has a genetic basis and produces a common type of eczema. Atopic dermatitis tends to begin early in life in those with a predisposition to inhalant allergies, but it probably does not have an allergic basis. Characteristically, rashes occur on the cheeks, neck, elbow and knee creases, and ankles. Irritant dermatitis: This occurs when the skin is repeatedly exposed to excessive washing or toxic substances. Allergic contact dermatitis: After repeated exposures to the same substance, an allergen, the body's immune recognition system becomes activated at the site of the next exposure and produces a dermatitis. An example of this would be poison ivy allergy. Stasis dermatitis: It commonly occurs on the swollen lower legs of people who have poor circulation in the veins of the legs. Fungal infections: This can produce a pattern identical to many other types of eczema, but the fungus can be visualized with a scraping under the microscope or grown in culture. Scabies: It's caused by an infestation by the human itch mite and may produce a rash very similar to other forms of eczema. Pompholyx (dyshidrotic eczema): This is a common but poorly understood health condition which classically affects the hands and occasionally the feet by producing an itchy rash composed of tiny blisters (vesicles) on the sides of the fingers or toes and palms or soles. Lichen simplex chronicus: It produces thickened plaques of skin commonly found on the shins and neck. Nummular eczema: This is a nonspecific term for coin-shaped plaques of scaling skin most often on the lower legs of older individuals. Xerotic (dry skin) eczema: The skin will crack and ooze if dryness becomes excessive. Seborrheic dermatitis: It produces a rash on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally the mid-chest in adults. In infants, in can produce a weepy, oozy rash behind the ears and can be quite extensive, involving the entire body."
What are the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vs. eczema?,"'Although symptoms and signs may vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.''Itch'' is the hallmark of the disease.''Typically, affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face, and neck.''The itchiness is an important factor in atopic dermatitis, because scratching and rubbing can worsen the skin inflammation that is characteristic of this disease.''People with atopic dermatitis seem to be more sensitive to itching and feel the need to scratch longer in response.''They develop what is referred to as the ""itch-scratch"" cycle.''The extreme itchiness of the skin causes the person to scratch, which in turn worsens the itch, and so on. Itching is particularly a problem during ''sleep'', when conscious control of scratching decreases and the absence of other outside stimuli makes the itchiness more noticeable.''Almost all patients with eczema complain of itching. Since the appearance of most types of eczema is similar, elevated plaques of red, bumpy skin, the distribution of the eruption can be of great help in distinguishing one type from another. For example, stasis dermatitis occurs most often on the lower leg while atopic dermatitis occurs in the front of the elbow and behind the knee.' "

What is atrial fibrillation?,'Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in which the electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper atria (chambers) of the heart. Many people with this condition have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). It is the most common supraventricular tachycardia.' 
"What is the normal function of the heart, and how does its electrical system work?","'The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles: 1) the ''right atrium'' (upper right); 2) the ''left atrium'' (upper left); 3) the ''right ventricle'' (lower right); and 4) the ''left ventricle'' (lower left).''Blood returning to the heart from the body contains low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. This blood flows into the right ''atrium'' and then down into the adjacent right ventricle. After the right ventricle fills, contraction of the right ''atrium'' pumps additional blood into the right ventricle. The right ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the ''lungs'' where the blood takes up oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. The blood then flows from the lungs to the left atrium, and then down into the adjacent left ventricle. Contraction of the left atrium pumps additional blood into the left ventricle. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps the blood to the aortic artery and then to the rest of the body via the vascular system.''The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles. The ventricles must deliver enough blood to the body for the body to function normally. The amount of blood that is pumped depends on several factors. The most important factor is the rate of contraction of the heart (the heart rate). As the rate increases, more blood is pumped. The heart pumps more blood with each beat when the atria contract and fill the ventricles with additional blood just before the ventricles contract.''With each beat of the heart, an electrical discharge (current) passes through the electrical system of the heart. This discharge causes the muscle of the atria and ventricles to contract and pump blood.''The electrical system of the heart consists of the SA node (sinoatrial node), the ''AV node'' (''atrioventricular node''), and special tissues in the atria and the ventricles that conduct the current.''The electrical discharges from the SA node cause the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The same discharges then pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles, traveling through the special tissues of the ventricles and causing the ventricles to contract. In a normal heart, the rate of atrial contraction is the same as the rate of ventricular contraction.''At rest, the frequency of the discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate in individuals who are in good clinical health.' The SA node is the heart's electrical pacemaker. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the right atrium; the frequency with which the SA node discharges determines the rate at which the heart beats. The current passes from the SA node, through the special tissues of the atria and into the AV node. The AV node serves as a relay station between the atria and the ventricles. Signals from the atria must pass through the AV node to reach the ventricles."
What causes atrial fibrillation?,"'The cause of atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm. During this rhythm, electrical discharges are not generated solely by the SA node. Instead, discharges come from other parts of the atria. These abnormal discharges are rapid and irregular and may exceed 350 discharges per minute. The rapid and irregular discharges cause ineffective contractions of the atria. In fact, the atria quiver rather than beat as a unit. This reduces the ability of the atria to pump blood into the ventricles.''The rapid and irregular discharges from the atria then pass through the AV node and into the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The contractions of the ventricles may average 150/minute, much slower than the rate in the atria. (The ventricles are unable to contract at 350/minute.) Even at an average rate of 150/minute, the ventricles may not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before the next contraction, particularly without the normal contraction of the atria. Thus, AFib decreases the amount of blood pumped by the ventricles because of their rapid rate of contraction and the absence of normal atrial contractions.' "
What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,"'Many patients with this condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and are unaware of the abnormal rhythm. When symptoms do occur, the most common one is heart ''palpitations'', an uncomfortable awareness of the rapid and irregular heartbeat. Other symptoms of the condition are caused by the diminished delivery of blood to the body. These symptoms include:''In a heart that is beating normally, the rate of ventricular contraction is the same as the rate of atrial contraction. In atrial fibrillation, however, the rate of ventricular contraction is less than the rate of atrial contraction. The rate of ventricular contraction in the condition is determined by the speed of transmission of the discharges through the AV node. In people with a normal AV node, the rate of ventricular contraction in untreated disease usually ranges from 80 to 180 beats/minute; the higher the transmission, the higher the heart rate.''Some older people have slow transmission through the AV node due to disease within the AV node. When these people develop the problem, their heart rates remain normal or slower than normal. As disease in the AV node advances, these people can even develop an excessively slow heart rate and require a permanent pacemaker to increase the rate of ventricular contractions.'   Dizziness Fainting Weakness Fatigue Shortness of breath Angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles)"
How can I know if I am at risk for developing atrial fibrillation?,"'There are many risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation. They include:''About 1 in 10,000 young adults in otherwise good health have the disease without any apparent cause or underlying cardiac problems. Atrial fibrillation of the heart in these individuals usually is intermittent, but can become chronic in 25%. This condition is referred to as lone AFib. ''Stress'', alcohol, tobacco, or use of ''stimulants'' may play a role in causing this ''arrhythmia''.' Increased age (1% of people over 60 years of age have the disease) Coronary disease (including heart attack) High blood pressure Abnormal heart muscle function (including congestive heart failure) Disease of the mitral valve between the left and right ventricle An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or overdose of thyroid medication Low amounts of oxygen in the blood, for example, as occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart (pericarditis) Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Chronic lung diseases (emphysema, asthma, COPD) Excessive intake of alcohol (alcoholism) Stimulant drug use such as cocaine or decongestants Recent heart or lung surgery Abnormal heart structure from the time of birth (congenital)"
How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?,"'Atrial fibrillation can be chronic and sustained, or brief and intermittent (paroxysmal). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refers to ''intermittent episodes of AF'' lasting, for example, minutes to hours. The rate reverts to normal between episodes. In ''chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation'"", the atria fibrillate all of the time. Chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation is not difficult to diagnose. Doctors can hear the rapid and irregular heartbeats using a stethoscope. Abnormal heartbeats also can be felt by taking a patient's pulse and by a doctor's diagnosis."" EKG (electrocardiogram): An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. The irregular EKG tracings of AF are easy to recognize provided AF occurs during the EKG. Echocardiography: Echocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce images of the chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Conditions that may accompany AF such as mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic valve diseases, and pericarditis (inflammation of the ""sack"" surrounding the heart) can be detected with echocardiography. Echocardiography also is useful in measuring the size of the atrial chambers. Atrial size is an important factor in determining how a patient responds to treatment for the disease. For instance, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain a normal rhythm in patients with enlarged atria. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a special echocardiographic technique that involves taking pictures of the atria using sound waves. A special probe that generates sound waves is placed in the esophagus (the food pipe connecting the mouth to the stomach). The probe is located at the end of a long flexible tube that is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. This technique brings the probe very close to the heart (which lies just in front of the esophagus). Sound waves generated by the probe are bounced off the structures within the heart, and the reflected sound waves are used to form a picture of the heart. TEE is very accurate for detecting blood clots in the atria as well as for measuring the size of the atria. Holter monitor: If episodes of the disease occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show AF. Therefore, a Holter monitor, a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours, often is used to diagnose intermittent episodes of AF. Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of atrial fibrillation are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, the patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for 1 to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of irregular heartbeats or symptoms possibly caused by AF. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later. Other tests: High blood pressure and signs of heart failure can be ascertained (determined) during a physical examination of the patient. Blood tests are performed to detect abnormalities in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, electrolytes, and thyroid hormone levels. Chest X-rays reveal enlargement of the heart, heart failure, and other diseases of the lung. Exercise treadmill testing (a continuous recording of the EKG during exercise) is a useful screening study for detecting severe coronary disease in a doctor's office or hospital."
What are the treatment guidelines for atrial fibrillation?,"'The treatment of atrial fibrillation is multi-faceted and involves:''However, each individual is unique, so the treatments vary depending on the patient’s medical condition (for example, presence of a pacemaker or compromised renal function). Those interested can see the extensive guidelines for various patients in the American Heart Association Journal, ''Circulation'', published in 2019; these may change as new methods and ''drugs'' are approved in the future.''An important first step in the treatment of AF is to uncover and correct health conditions (such as ''hyperthyroidism'' or use of stimulant drugs) that can cause the disease. These steps include:'   Reversing the factors that cause atrial fibrillation. Slowing the heart rate with medications. Preventing strokes. Converting atrial fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm with medications or electrical shock. Preventing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation with medications. Using procedures (for example, pacemakers, defibrillators, surgery) to prevent episodes of the disease. Stopping the use of stimulant drugs and excessive alcohol intake Controlling high blood pressure Correcting hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) and low blood oxygen levels Controlling cardiac failure and treating the diseases of the heart and the lungs that can cause atrial fibrillation"
Drugs that slow the heart rate,"'Having excluded or corrected the factors that cause the disease, the next step when the ventricles are beating too rapidly usually is to slow the rate at which the ventricles beat.''A person with the disease and healthy AV nodes usually has ventricles that beat rapidly. Drugs are necessary to slow down the rapid heart rate. Drugs to slow the heart rate include:''These medications slow the heart rate by retarding conduction of the electrical discharges through the AV node. These medications, however, do not usually convert AFib back into a normal rhythm. Other drugs or treatments are necessary to achieve a normal heart rhythm and improve health.''Benefits of controlling the rate:'"" In patients with rapid ventricle contractions as a result of the disease, slowing the rate of ventricular contractions improves the heart's efficiency in delivering blood (by allowing more time between contractions for the ventricles to fill with blood) and relieves the symptoms of inadequate flow of blood -- dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath.""'With chronic, sustained disease, doctors may decide to leave some patients in atrial fibrillation if their heart rates are under control, the output of blood from the ventricles is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned to prevent strokes. This form of treatment is called rate control therapy (discussed in this article).''Limitations of medications for controlling the heart rate:'' In people with diseased AV nodes, ventricular contractions may be slower than in those who have normal AV nodes. Moreover, some elderly individuals with atrial fibrillation are extremely sensitive to medications that slow the rate of ventricular contractions, usually because of a diseased AV node. In these patients, the heart rate can become dangerously slow with small doses of medications to slow the heart. This condition is referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, or ""sick sinus syndrome."" Patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome need medications to control the fast heart rate and a pacemaker to provide a minimum safe rate.''Drugs used in slowing atrial fibrillation generally cannot convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. Therefore, these patients are at risk for the formation of blood clots in the heart and strokes, and will need prolonged blood thinning with ''anticoagulants'' like ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'').'   digitalis (Digoxin) Beta-blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), esmolol (Brevibloc) Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Calan), diltiazem (Cardizem)"
Risks and candidates for cardioversion,"'The complications of cardioversion include ''stroke'', ''burns'' of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these problems are very uncommon.''Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained atrial fibrillation undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion. Cardioversion usually is attempted with drugs first. If medications fail, electrical cardioversion can be considered. Sometimes a doctor may choose to use electrical cardioversion first if AF is of short duration (onset within 48 hours) and the transesophageal echocardiography shows no blood clots in the atria.''Cardioversion is performed urgently (on an emergency basis) on patients with severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms caused by AFib. For example, some patients with rapid AF can develop chest ''pain'', shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting. (Chest ''pain'' in these patients is due to an insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscles. Shortness of breath indicates ineffective pumping of blood by the ventricles. Fainting or dizziness usually is due to dangerously ''low blood pressure''.)''Recent studies have shown that an acceptable alternative to cardioversion (chemical or electrical) is rate-control therapy. In this therapy, the doctor will leave the patients in AF provided their rate of ventricular contractions is under good control, the output of blood from the heart is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned by warfarin to prevent strokes. Heart rate in these patients can be controlled using medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin or AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation. Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).''Over long periods of observation, patients treated with rate-control therapy have similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.''Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:' People who have had atrial fibrillation for more than one year Individuals with significant disease of the heart valves People with enlarged hearts as a result of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) Patients with significant or intolerable side effects with drugs used for the condition."
Cardioversion with medications,"'Before prescribing medications for cardioversion, the doctor usually controls the rate of ventricular contractions and thins the blood, usually with warfarin.''Drugs used in cardioversion usually work by blocking the channels in the walls of cells through which ions travel (sodium channels, potassium channels, beta adrenergic channels, and calcium channels). Some examples of these medications include:'""These drugs are capable of converting AFib to normal rhythm in about 50% of patients. They often are used long term to maintain a normal rhythm, and prevent recurrences of AFib, and increase the person's health.""'Drugs used for converting atrial fibrillation carry a small risk of causing other ''abnormal heart rhythms'"" -- they are said to be proarrhythmic -- especially in patients with diseases of the heart muscle or coronary arteries. These abnormal heart rhythms can be more life threatening than atrial fibrillation. Therefore, treatment with these medications often is initiated in the hospital while the patient's rhythm is continuously monitored for 24 to 72 hours.""'These medications may not be effective in the longer term. Many patients eventually develop a recurrence of atrial fibrillation despite the medications.''Drugs used in treating atrial fibrillation often have important side effects. Many patients discontinue them because they cannot tolerate these side effects. For example:''The most severe side effect of amiodarone is lung toxicity that potentially can be fatal. Because of this lung toxicity, patients should report any symptoms of ''cough'', ''fever'', or painful ''breathing'' to their doctors.' quinidine (Quinaglute) -- rarely used procainamide (Procan SR) -- rarely used disopyramide (Norpace) -- rarely used sotalol (Betapace) flecainide (Tambocor) amiodarone (Cordarone) Amiodarone commonly is used to treat atrial fibrillation because it is less proarrhythmic, and has been shown to maintain a normal rhythm in up to 75% of patients. However, amiodarone may cause side effects and drug interactions. Amiodarone can interact with other medications such as tricyclic antidepressants -- for example, amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep) -- or phenothiazine antipsychotics -- for example, chlorpromazine (Thorazine) -- and cause abnormal heart rhythms. Amiodarone interacts with warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) and increases the risk of bleeding, which can occur as early as 4 to 6 days after the start of both drugs, or can be delayed by a few weeks. Thus, doctors prescribing both warfarin and amiodarone will adjust the dose of warfarin to avoid excessive blood thinning. Amiodarone also can cause thyroid disturbances in the fetus when administered orally to the mother during pregnancy. Amiodarone also may affect thyroid function in adults."
What is electrical cardioversion?,"'Other methods of converting AFib to a normal rhythm include electrical cardioversion and rate control therapy.''Electrical cardioversion is a procedure used by doctors to convert an abnormal rhythm (such as AFib) to a normal rhythm (sinus rhythm). Electrical cardioversion requires the administration of an electrical shock over the chest. This electrical shock stops the abnormal electrical activity of the heart for a brief moment and allows the normal rhythm to take over. Although electrical cardioversion can be used to treat almost any abnormal fast heartbeat (such as ''atrial flutter'' and ventricular tachycardia), it is used most frequently to convert atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm.''Warfarin usually is given for 3 to 4 weeks prior to cardioversion to minimize the risk of ''stroke'' that can occur during or shortly after cardioversion. Warfarin is continued for 4 to 6 weeks after successful cardioversion. For some patients requiring urgent electrical cardioversion, warfarin may not work fast enough to thin the blood. Therefore, these patients may be given ''heparin'' prior to electrical cardioversion. Heparin is a faster-acting blood thinner than warfarin, but it must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion or as injections under the skin. After successful cardioversion, these patients can be switched from heparin to warfarin.''Method of cardioversion''Electrical cardioversions (urgent and elective) usually are performed in a hospital. For elective (nonurgent) electrical cardioversion, patients usually arrive at the hospital without eating in the morning. Necessary medications can be taken with small sips of water. Patients are given supplemental oxygen via nasal catheters, and an intravenous infusion of fluids is started. Electrodes (pads) are placed on the skin over the chest, which continuously monitors the heart rhythm. Paddles then are placed over the chest and the upper back. Patients are sedated (anesthetized) intravenously with medication, which is followed by a strong electric shock through the paddles. The shock converts the atrial fibrillation to a normal rhythm. After cardioversion, patients are observed for several hours or overnight to make sure that their normal heart rhythm is stable.''Effectiveness of electrical cardioversion''Electrical cardioversion is more effective than medications alone in terminating atrial fibrillation and restoring a normal rhythm. Electrical cardioversion successfully restores a normal rhythm in over 95% of patients.''Limitations of electrical cardioversion''While electrical cardioversion is effective in converting AFib to a normal heart rhythm, the normal rhythm may not continue for long. Approximately 75% of patients successfully treated with electrical cardioversion experience a recurrence of atrial fibrillation within 12 to 24 months. Older patients with enlarged atria and ventricles who have had atrial fibrillation for a long time are especially prone to recurrences. Thus, most patients who undergo successful cardioversion are placed on oral medications to prevent recurrences of the arrhythmia.' "
Risks and candidates for electrical cardioversion,"'The risks of electrical cardioversion include ''stroke'', ''burns'' of the skin, and in rare instances, death. However, these complications are very uncommon.''Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic, sustained AF undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion. Cardioversion usually is attempted with medications first. If medications fail, electrical cardioversion can be considered. Sometimes a doctor may choose to use electrical cardioversion first if AFib is of short duration (onset within 48 hours) and the transesophageal echocardiography shows no blood clots in the atria.''Electrical cardioversion is performed urgently (on an emergency basis) on patients with severe and potentially life-threatening symptoms caused by AFib. For example, some patients with rapid AFib can develop chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting. Chest pains in these individuals are due to an insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscles. Shortness of breath indicates ineffective pumping of blood by the ventricles. Fainting or dizziness usually is due to dangerously ''low blood pressure''.''Recent studies have shown that an acceptable alternative to cardioversion (chemical or electrical) is rate-control therapy. In this therapy, the doctor will leave the individuals in AFib provided their rate of ventricular contractions is under good control, the output of blood from the heart is adequate, and their blood is adequately thinned by warfarin to prevent strokes. The rate in these patients can be controlled using medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin or AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation. Rate-control therapy is used to simplify therapy and avoid the side effects of anti-arrhythmic medications (medications used to treat and prevent atrial fibrillation).''Over long periods of observation, individuals treated with rate-control therapy had similar survival and quality of life as compared to those who undergo repeated electrical or chemical cardioversions.''Suitable candidates for rate-control therapy include:' Patients who have had atrial fibrillation for more than one year Patients with significant disease of the heart valves Patients with enlarged hearts as a result of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle weakness) Patients with significant or intolerable side effects with medications for atrial fibrillation"
Newer medications to prevent stroke,"'Newer antithrombotic medial agents that are as effective as warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation and that do not require such intense monitoring or dietary restrictions include:''These antithrombotic drugs work by a different mechanism from warfarin and are suitable for many, but not all, patients. Discuss possible use of these medications with your doctor.''Converting to a normal rhythm can be accomplished with medications (chemical cardioversion) or by electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion). Doctors usually recommend that all patients with chronic sustained AFib undergo at least one attempt at cardioversion, chemical or electrical. Successful cardioversion can alleviate symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve quality of life, and lower the risk of strokes. Doctors usually attempt medical cardioversion first, and, if medications fail, then try electrical cardioversion.''Patients who are more likely to attain and maintain a normal rhythm with either chemical or electrical cardioversion include patients:' rivaroxaban (Xarelto) apixaban (Eliquis) dabigatran (Pradaxa) Younger than 65 years of age Who have had the disease for a short time (less than 12 months) With normal-sized atria and ventricles Who are having their first episode of AF"
Procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'After successful cardioversion, many patients (up to 75%) may experience recurrence of AFib within 12 months. Therefore, many patients will need long-term treatment with medications to prevent a recurrence of the disease; however, medication(s) are effective only 50% to 75% of the time in preventing recurrence. Moreover, many people cannot tolerate the side effects of long-term medication. For these reasons, several procedures have been developed to treat and prevent recurrence of the condition to return the person to good health; they include:''Ablation of the AV node is a procedure that destroys the AV node so that the atrial electrical discharges cannot pass through the AV node to activate the ventricles. The procedure usually is performed in a ''cardiac catheterization'' unit or an electrophysiology unit of a hospital.'   Ablation of the AV node with implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of a pacemaker Implantation of an atrial defibrillator Maze procedure Procedure: For ablation of the AV node, individuals are given a local anesthetic to minimize pain and are mildly sedated with intravenous medications. Using X-ray guidance, a wire (catheter) is inserted through a vein in the groin to reach the heart. Electrical recordings from inside the heart help to locate the AV node. The AV node is destroyed (ablated) using heat delivered by the catheter. After successful ablation of the AV node, electrical discharges from the atria can no longer reach the ventricles. Destruction of the AV node (whether by catheter ablation or by disease that occurs with age) can lead to an excessively slow rate of ventricular contractions (slow heart rate). Therefore, a pacemaker is implanted in order to provide the heart with a minimum safe heart rate. Benefits of ablation of the AV node: The benefits of ablation of the AV node and implantation of a pacemaker include:Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate)Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breathAbility to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Resumption of a regular heart rate (even though a pacemaker may be determining the heart rate) Relief from palpitations, fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breath Ability to stop medications and avoid their potentially serious side effects Risks of ablation of the AV node: Potential complications of ablation of the AV node and permanent implantation of a pacemaker include bleeding, infection, heart attack, stroke, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall, and death. Still, this technique has helped many patients with severe symptoms to live normally. Candidates for ablation of the AV node: Candidates for ablation of the AV node are patients with AF who respond poorly to both chemical and electrical cardioversion. These patients experience repeated relapses of atrial fibrillation, often with rapid rates of ventricular contractions despite medications. Ablation also may be an option for patients who develop serious side effects from the medications that are used for treating and preventing AF. Limitations of ablation of the AV node: Ablation of the AV node only controls the rate with which the ventricles beat. It does not convert AF to normal rhythm. Therefore, blood clots still can form in the atria and patients are still at risk for strokes. Thus, there is a need for long-term anticoagulation in addition to the permanent pacemaker."
Other procedures for treating and preventing atrial fibrillation,"'Permanent pacemakers are battery-operated devices that generate electrical discharges that cause the heart to beat more rapidly when the heart is beating too slowly. Recent studies suggest that some patients with recurrent paroxysmal AFib can benefit from the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Although the reasons for this benefit are unknown, regular electrical pulses from the pacemakers may prevent the recurrence of AFib. Furthermore, newer pacemakers that can stimulate two different sites within the atria (dual site atrial pacing) may be even more effective than standard pacemakers in preventing AFib. Nevertheless, permanent pacemaker implantation cannot be considered as standard non-medication treatment for atrial fibrillation.''Implantable atrial defibrillators can detect and convert atrial fibrillation back to a normal rhythm by using high-energy shocks. By detecting atrial fibrillation and terminating it quickly, doctors hope that these devices will prevent recurrences of AFib over the long term.''Atrial defibrillators are surgically implanted within the chest under local anesthesia. These devices deliver high-energy shocks to the heart that are somewhat painful. Atrial defibrillators are not useful in patients with chronic sustained atrial fibrillation and are suitable only for patients with infrequent episodic attacks of AFib.''Many doctors believe that the atria cannot fibrillate if they are sectioned into small pieces so that the conduction of the electrical current through the atria is interrupted. During the Maze procedure, numerous incisions are made in the atria to control the irregular heartbeat and restore a regular rhythm.' Procedure: The Maze procedure is most commonly performed via open-heart surgery. Some electrophysiologists (doctors specially trained to treat abnormalities of rhythm) are now attempting to perform the Maze procedure using catheters inside the heart that are passed through a vein in the groin without open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, the success rate using the catheter is below 50% and complications (such as strokes) may occur. Effectiveness of the Maze procedure: The Maze procedure done surgically (using open-heart surgery) has been reported to correct atrial fibrillation in 90% to 99% of patients. Only 15% to 20% of the patients need a pacemaker after surgery, and there is only a 30% chance of requiring long-term medications to maintain a normal rhythm. Risks of the Maze procedure: The surgical Maze procedure involves open-heart surgery and the pumping of blood by an external bypass pump while the surgery is performed, much like patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. The complications are not insignificant and include stroke, bleeding, infection, and death. Therefore, doctors usually do not recommend a surgical Maze procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation unless the patient is undergoing open-heart surgery for another condition (such as for coronary artery bypass or replacement or repair of a diseased heart valve)."
What are the complications of atrial fibrillation?,"'Heart failure:'' If the heart is unable to pump an adequate amount of blood to the body, as in some people with atrial fibrillation, the body begins to compensate by retaining fluid. This can lead to a condition called heart failure. Heart failure results in the accumulation of fluid in the lower legs (''edema'') and the lungs (''pulmonary edema''). Pulmonary edema makes breathing more difficult and reduces the ability of the lung to add oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The levels of oxygen in the blood can drop, and the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood can increase, a complication called respiratory failure. This is a life-threatening complication. In patients with underlying ''heart disease'', the development of AFib may result in up to a 25% decrease in the pumping function of the heart.''Stroke:'' Quivering of the atria in atrial fibrillation causes blood inside the atria to stagnate. Stagnant blood tends to form blood clots along the walls of the atria. Sometimes, these blood clots dislodge, pass through the ventricles, and lodge in the brain, lungs, and other parts of the body. This process is called embolization. One common complication of AFib is a ''blood clot'' that travels to the brain and causes the sudden onset of one-sided ''paralysis'' of the extremities and/or the facial muscles (an embolic stroke). A ''blood clot'"" that travels to the lungs can cause injury to the lung tissues (pulmonary infarction), and symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. When blood clots travel to the body's extremities, ""'cold hands'', ''feet'', or legs may occur suddenly because of the lack of blood.'  "
What is pulmonary vein isolation?,"'The four pulmonary veins are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. There is a narrow band of muscle cells that surrounds the openings of the pulmonary veins where they enter the left atrium. This band of muscle cells may begin to actively discharge electrically, and this discharge may initiate atrial fibrillation. During pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the band of muscle cells is destroyed by energy applied through a catheter. This effectively blocks the electrical discharges from crossing over from the band to the left atrium and, hence, prevents atrial fibrillation.''Before PVI, the doctor performs a history and physical examination, an EKG, a 24-hour Holter monitor, and a transesophageal ''echocardiogram'' to exclude blood clots in the atria, and, sometimes, a CAT scan of the chest. The doctor also may ask the person to stop certain medications, particularly blood thinners such as ''aspirin'', clopidogrel (''Plavix''), or warfarin, several days before the procedure. The doctor may check a blood prothrombin time and INR level to make sure that blood clotting is adequate for the procedure.''PVI is usually performed under deep conscious sedation (but occasionally general anesthesia) in a cardiac electrophysiology laboratory and takes 3 to 6 hours. Several catheters are inserted through large veins (in the neck, arm, or groin) and fed into the left atrium under X-ray (fluoroscopy) guidance. One of the catheters is equipped with an ultrasound transducer that allows the doctor to view the structures inside the heart during the procedure. The junction of the pulmonary veins with the left atrium is identified, and energy is then applied through another catheter to this area. This results in the destruction of the band of muscle cells and their replacement by a ''scar''. This process is repeated at the opening of each of the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium.''Course after pulmonary vein isolation:'"" After PVI, patients remain in the hospital telemetry unit so that the heart's rhythm can be monitored.""'Many patients will experience AFib and palpitations (irregular heartbeat) while in the hospital and during the first 2 or 3 months following PVI. Therefore, they are given medications such as amiodarone to prevent episodes of AFib and anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin to prevent strokes. The palpitations and episodes of AFib gradually decrease. By 3 months after the procedure, the majority of patients will have a normal rhythm, return to good health, and the doctor may stop warfarin and amiodarone.''Patients usually will have an EKG and a CAT scan of the chest 3 months after PVI. The CAT scan is done to make sure that there is no narrowing of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein stenosis) due to the scarring.''Effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation: ''PVI in the U.S. is a relatively new procedure. When performed by experienced doctors, PVI can be expected to prevent AFib in 70% to 80% of patients during the first year. Some patients may need additional PVI procedures to prevent further atrial fibrillation episodes. Because this procedure is new, it is difficult to know whether successfully treated patients will continue in a normal rhythm for a prolonged period.' "
"Who are candidates for PVI, and what are the risks?","'Generally, good candidates for PVI include:''When performed by doctors experienced in PVI, the procedure is safe. The risks of pulmonary vein isolation include cardiac tamponade (bleeding into the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart), narrowing of the openings of the pulmonary veins, injury to the phrenic nerve that controls the function of the ''diaphragm'', injury to peripheral blood vessels, and, in rare cases, death.''In the early years of PVI, doctors were trying to destroy the tissues inside the pulmonary veins. This led to narrowing (due to scarring) of the pulmonary veins, which in turn led to ''pulmonary hypertension'', a condition in which the ''blood pressure'' in the pulmonary veins and arteries increases. ''Pulmonary hypertension'' is a serious condition that can lead to congestive heart failure and even death. Doctors no longer try to destroy tissue inside the pulmonary veins. Instead, they try to destroy the tissues only at the junction of the pulmonary veins and the atria. The current technique is not only safer, but is more effective and simpler.'

What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' (''AFib'', AF) is a disturbance of the rhythm of the heartbeat (''arrhythmia''), a type of ''heart'' rhythm disorder.''To understand how ''atrial fibrillation'"" occurs, let's first understand the normal rhythm of the heart, and how the electrical activation of a heartbeat occurs. In a person with a healthy heart, the rhythm of the heartbeat is initiated by electrical activation of the natural ""'pacemaker'' of the heart -- the sinoatrial node (SA node). From there, the electrical activity spreads along natural pathways through the two chambers of the top of the heart (atria), then to the ventricles that pump the blood out into the circulation. The uniform contraction of the ''atrium'' that is generated by the electrical stimulation of the heart muscle of the ''atrium'', causes the ''atrium'' to contract, passing blood into the ventricle where it can then be pumped out into the circulation.''AFib'' occurs when the top chambers of the heart fire with electrical activity that is completely chaotic throughout the ''atrium'', without really forming a uniformly contracting ''atrium'' to pass blood down into the ventricles. The random electrical activity throughout the ''atrium'' connects randomly to the ventricle. This leads to what is referred to as an irregular heart rhythm of this common condition. AFib can cause the ventricle to contract irregularly at rates ranging from 100 to 200 beats per minute.''The irregularity of the heart contractions in AFib account for all of the symptoms caused by the disease. This condition is a type of ''heart disease''.' "
What are atrial fibrillation symptoms and signs?,"'Very often people with AFib have no signs or symptoms, and do not know they are in ''atrial fibrillation''. Those who notice when they are having ''atrial fibrillation'' can have signs and symptoms ranging from mild to debilitating.''Symptoms of this heart condition include:'  Rapid beating, pounding, or fluttering sensation in the chest (palpitations) Lightheadedness Dizziness Weakness Shortness of breath Uneasy feeling Fainting Fatigue Awakening from sleep Anxiousness Difficulty walking Chest discomfort or pain"
What does atrial fibrillation feel like?,"'A person with ''atrial fibrillation'' that causes no symptoms - causes no abnormal feelings or sensations. However, when a person experiences symptoms and signs of this type of ''heart disease'', one of the most common symptoms is a feeling of the heart beating rapidly. It also can feel like the heart is fluttering in the chest with ''palpitations'' as the heart beats irregularly. Because the chambers of the heart are beating irregularly, they do not adequately fill with blood before contracting. This causes insufficient oxygen distribution throughout the body, which can lead to:''Some people with early ''atrial fibrillation'' may have minimal symptoms. Often it is short-lived and the normal heart rhythm is restored. Later, this heart condition can occur more frequently, and for a longer duration of each episode. This is when signs and symptoms the person may be experiencing can be even more pronounced, and treatment may be necessary.'   Lightheadedness and dizziness, which may cause the person to fall from near fainting when they are upright. There can be a general sensation of weakness in the legs as well as an overall uneasy feeling Overall fatigue is commonly associated with shortness of breath. Ascending stairs or walking uphill this can make any movement difficult for a person with this health condition. There can be chest awareness and chest discomfort. Sometimes people with this disease wake up in the night with chest awareness (consciously noticing the organs within the chest that you normally are not aware of), palpitations, and anxiousness. The person can be sweating and a have a feeling of not being well."
Do all types of atrial fibrillation have the same symptoms?,"'Atrial ''fibrillation'' can be categorized as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.' Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurs in random episodes and does not persist, but spontaneously returns to normal heart rhythm after the episode (it comes and goes). Paroxysmal fibrillation symptoms include sudden onset of fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort when the atrial fibrillation begins. This can be associated with rapid onset fatigue and weakness. When it comes on at night it can awaken the person from sleep with sweating and anxiousness. Persistent atrial fibrillation is AFib that once initiated continues without spontaneously reverting to normal heart rhythm. Persistent AFib resolves only with chemical or electrical cardioversion. Persistent atrial fibrillation symptoms are identical to those of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation except that they do not spontaneously resolve. Permanent atrial fibrillation: Sometimes the heart rhythm of persistent atrial fibrillation cannot be converted to normal rhythm by cardioversion methods or the cardioversion is not sustained. In this situation, medications are used to slow the rapid heart rhythm so the heart can pump more efficiently and symptoms can be reduced. Permanent atrial fibrillation symptoms are typically less intense than those of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation as the rate of beating of the ventricles is slowed by drugs."
Who is at risk for atrial fibrillation?,"'There are several risk factors for this condition. For example, a patient who has, or has a history of:' Coronary heart disease Hypertension (high blood pressure) Blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Heart failure Chronic lung diseases, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and asthma. Excessive alcohol intake Stimulant drug use, for example, cocaine or decongestants Recent heart or lung surgery Congenital heart disease"
Are heart attack or stroke symptoms different from atrial fibrillation symptoms?,"'A person that has chest discomfort or ''pain'' with AFib could be having a ''heart attack''. It is not possible to distinguish the cause of the chest discomfort or ''pain'' without a complete medical evaluation, including an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'').''Atrial fibrillation can lead to ''stroke'' from a ''blood clot'' in the heart dislodging and going to the brain. Four signs of ''stroke'' include:''AFib, ''stroke'', and ''heart attack'' are medical emergencies and the person who is ill should be seen by a doctor for treatment immediately.' Sudden onset slurring of speech Face drooping Drooling Weakness or numbness in an extremity"
What is the treatment for atrial fibrillation symptoms?,"'Treatment and management of ''symptoms of atrial fibrillation'' by either restoring the abnormal heart rhythm back to normal, or by controlling the abnormally fast rate.''To restore the heart rhythm to normal sometimes ''drugs'' are used intravenously that can convert the rhythm from AFib to normal sinus rhythm. There are many drugs and medical procedures that are very effective for eliminating and preventing AFib. Alternatively, electroshock pulse to the chest and heart can reset the heart rhythm to normal, and there are surgical interventions, for example, cardiac ablations and Maze procedures (a type of ablation) that can permanently correct this disease. The treating doctor will advise the best option for each individual as the ideal option varies from patient to patient.''A variety of drugs can be used to either decrease the electrical excitability of the heart in atrial fibrillation or limit the transmission of chaotic electrical impulses that reach the ventricles. Both are used to achieve a slower and more efficient heartbeat.''Medications referred to as ""blood thinners"" are frequently used for the treatment and management of AFib in order to prevent blood from clotting in the atria, which can lead to ''stroke''. These include ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven'') and newer ''anticoagulants''. Often, ''anticoagulants'' are used for several weeks to minimize the risk of ''stroke''. In this case, drugs are used to slow the heart rate until the blood is adequately thinned. Simple ''aspirin'' is not an adequate blood thinner for AFib.''Atrial fibrillation is a health condition that a doctor should\xa0evaluate\xa0and diagnose. A patient should discuss his or her treatment plan with a\xa0doctor or other health care professional.''If you or someone you know experiences sign and ''symptoms of AFib'', ''stroke'', ''heart failure'', or heart attack seek medical care for treatment by a doctor, urgent care, or emergency room facility immediately.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with atrial fibrillation?,"'A person with this type of ''heart disease'' can live a normal, active life as long as he or she continues to receive ongoing medical treatment.' "
What is atrial fibrillation?,"'Atrial ''fibrillation'' also referred to as a fib, ''AFib'', A fib, ''AFIB'', AFib and ''A-fib'') is a form of ''heart disease'' that causes an irregular and usually rapid heart rhythm that results from abnormal electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart (atria) to the ''AV node''.''Normally, our heart muscle contractions are initiated from an electrical impulse in the ''right atrium'' in the sinoatrial sinus node. This is the “natural ''pacemaker''” that causes the normal range of regular heartbeats (normal rhythm or sinus rhythm) that begin with electrical-induced muscular contraction in the ''atrium'' to move oxygenated blood from the ''left atrium'' to the ''left ventricle'' (blood enters the left ''atrium'' through the pulmonary veins). When this normal electrical impulse is disrupted by additional electrical activity of cells in the ''atrium'' outside of the sinoatrial node, often the result is either irregular signals that result in chaotic muscular contractions of the atria or very fast and regular signals where contractions are less chaotic. If the atrial electrical signals are very fast and regular, ''atrial flutter'' occurs. If the atrial generated signals are irregular or chaotic, ''atrial fibrillation'' occurs. People describe ''atrial fibrillation'' as feeling:''Serious symptoms that require immediate medical treatment (call 911) include:''Although there are no blood tests that can confirm a diagnosis of ''atrial fibrillation'', your doctor may order blood tests to check for other health problems that may mimic or contribute to your symptoms, for example, infections, ''heart attacks'', and thyroid problems.''Picture of a Cross Section of the Heart Including the Atria and Ventricles.

What drugs are used to treat and manage atrial fibrillation?,"'This article will introduce you to treatments for AFib. Other non-medical treatments for this ''heart disease'' include, for example, electrical ''cardioversion'', catheter ablation therapy, ''pacemaker'' implantation, the Maze procedure, and others. Most treatment programs for ''atrial fibrillation'' begin with drugs. Usually, these drugs are grouped into three large categories:''Some of the drugs used to treat this condition have more than one effect on the heart, for example, ''sotalol'' (''Betapace''+654) can affect both rate of the heart and heart rhythm.' Drugs that slow the heart rate Heart rhythm medications called antiarrhythmic drugs Blood thinners"
List of drugs that slow the heart rate,"'The majority of people with AFib have increased heart rate. This increased heart rate, which is due to AFib, does not allow enough blood into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) and can weaken the heart over time. Several drugs are available to slow the rate of the heart.''Beta-blockers'' is a class of drugs that prevent stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for increased cardiac action (contractions or pulse rate). For example, epinephrine receptors can be blocked.''Examples of ''beta-blockers'' that may be used treat AFib include:''Drugs that slow the heart rate by blocking calcium influx into cells, thereby relaxing heart and smooth muscles lining the arteries. Two major drugs used for slowing the heart rate in AFib are called centrally acting drugs because they act on the heart and blood vessels. Peripherally acting ''CCBs'' do not affect the heart.''Examples of ''calcium channel blockers'' used to treat AFib include:''Digitalis is a drug that strengthens heart muscle contractions and slows the heart. Brand names include:'   metoprolol (Lopressor) metoprolol succinate (Toprol-KL) labetalol (Trandate), short-acting, 3-6 hours nadolol (Corgard) nadolol (Coreg) atenolol (Tenormin) nebivolol (Bystolic) acebutolol (Sectral), short-acting, 3-4 hours penbutolol (Levatol) penbutolol (Kerlone) bisoprolol (Zebeta) pindolol (Visken), short-acting, 3-4 hours Betapace (sotalol hydrochloride) timolol propranolol (Inderal), short-acting, 3-5 hours diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem CD) diltiazem hydrochloride (Dilacor XR) verapamil hydrochloride (Calan SR) verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan) verapamil hydrochloride (Covera-HS) Lanoxin Digitek"
List of drugs that control the heart rhythm,"'Many people with AFib may be treated with ''beta blockers''; however, the irregular electrical activity generated in the atria may still produce symptoms.'""Sodium and potassium channel blockers are two main types of drugs used specifically to treat the chaotic electrical activity produced in the atria, which makes the heart's electrical function more normal.

List of drugs that prevent blood clots and strokes,"'Erratic and chaotic heart muscle contractions that occur in AFib increase the likelihood that those ''blood clots'' will develop in the heart. This consequence can lead to serious problems such as ''stroke''. Doctors use blood thinners to help prevent these blood clots.''Two primary types of drugs used to prevent blood clots from ''atrial fibrillation'' are antiplatelets and ''anticoagulants''.''Antiplatelet drugs interfere with the normal blood clotting process that causes clots to form.

Questions to ask your doctor about your atrial fibrillation medications.,"'A variety of drugs may be used to treat atrial ''fibrillation''. However, each person is unique, and some people may not respond to medical treatment, and others may require both medical treatment and invasive techniques like ablation therapy. Many doctors recommend trying these medications before recommending additional invasive therapy. You and your doctors can decide which atrial fibrillation therapy is most likely to help you with your problem. Discuss the potential outcomes and side effects of your therapy with you doctors. In addition, discuss your heart health in relation to ''diet'' and ''exercise'' to avoid ''high blood pressure'', ''heart disease'', ''heart failure'', and recurrence of AFib.' "
"What is atrial flutter, and what is atrial fibrillation (definitions)?","'Atrial flutter'' is a type of atrial tachycardia that results in an ''arrhythmia'' (rhythm disorder or not a normal rhythm) where the atria of the ''heart'' beat too quickly in a fast, usually regular, rhythm. ''Atrial fibrillation'' is another type of atrial tachycardia that is closely related to atrial ''flutter''. However, the arrhythmia that occurs in ''AFib'' is much more chaotic and results in a fast and usually very irregular heart rhythm or a atypical and irregular ventricular rate that can effect heart health.'  "
"Are atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation the same thing?","'Atrial flutter'', ''atrial fibrillation'"" (AFib), and atrial tachycardia are not the same things. However, all three terms have in common a rapid heart rate that can be felt when a person feels their pulse. Atrial tachycardia is a general term that indicates a cardiac condition where the rate of contraction of the heart's atria is fast and not normal, but does not describe the type of heart rhythm other than fast. Atrial tachycardia's are also termed supraventricular tachycardia's and are a type of ""'cardiac arrhythmia'' that usually result in a fast heartbeat, even at rest.''In contrast, atrial flutter and AFib are two of the main types of atrial tachycardia. They are distinguished by the different patterns of abnormal electrical impulses generated in the atria; a regular pattern for atrial flutter and an irregular pattern for AFib. Both are considered an abnormal heart rhythm and not good for heart health, and both have the potential to decrease the overall health of the patient.' "
What are the differences in how atrial flutter and AFib affect the heart (ECG wave strip patterns)?,"'Atrial flutter is a health condition that causes the atria of the heart to have a conduction or electrical problem that result in a re-entry loop in a regular pattern the causes the atria to beat at a rapid rate of about 240-360 beats per minute (bpm). The atrial flutter waves are regular and on an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'') are seen as P waves in a regular ""saw tooth"" pattern (small P waves in succession with short or no intervals between each wave). Often, the flutter waves are not completely transferred through the ''AV node'"" to the ventricular heart chambers so occasionally electrical conduction blocks occur and produce a 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1 ventricular contraction rate that is mainly regular. The most common atrial flutter occurs when the atria beat at a rate of 300 bpm and ventricular contraction rate is 150 bpm (2:1 conduction). Infrequently, some patients with flutter waves may also have bradycardia because the heart's ventricles are not receiving most of the flutter P waves. Flutter waves may come and go spontaneously in some patients. Atrial flutter is the second most common tachyarrhythmia.""'Atrial fibrillation'' is the most common tachyarrhythmia. The incidence is about 27-28 per 1000 person years. AFib is a ''heart disease'' that causes the atria of the heart to have a conduction or electrical problem that results in a chaotic, irregular production of irregular QRS waves with no P waves. In contrast to flutter waves, the abnormal conduction creates irregular, rapid occurring QRS waves, some of which are conducted to the heart ventricles through the ''AV node''. This results in the heart having ventricular contractions that are irregular, variable in effective blood pumping and usually range from about 100-175 bpm.'""ECG of the heart's abnormal electrical problem in AFib""""ECG\xa0of the Abnormal Conduction of the Hear'ts Electrical System in AFib\xa0""""Picture of the heart's abnormal electrical conduction in AFib"" "
"Which heart condition is more serious, atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation?","'Both heart diseases have the potential of becoming serious. However, many doctors and other health care professionals consider atrial flutter to be less serious than ''atrial fibrillation'' because flutter symptoms tend to be less severe and flutter waves have a less risk of embolization (clot formation). In addition, flutter waves also tend to revert back to sinus rhythm spontaneously more often in some patients.' "
"What's the difference between how these two heart conditions feel (symptoms); 
can you feel atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation?","""The difference between atrial flutter and AFib in terms of feeling are very similar. However, if the person can have someone (or even themselves) feel a pulse, if the pulse is regular even though it's fast, the problem is probably atrial flutter. If the pulse is fast and irregular, then the person is more likely to have AFib.""'Although some people have no symptoms and cannot feel the arrhythmias, common clinical symptoms of both arrhythmias are:''Serious symptoms may include the following:'   Palpitations (person feels their heart 
beating or pounding) Fatigue Shortness of breath Feeling like you going to faint Blurry vision Lightheadedness Heart skipping beats More severe shortness of breath Sweating Chest pain Fainting or loss of consciousness"
"Do the causes and risk factors for atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation 
differ?","'Any damage to the healthy electrical ''pacemaker'"" in the heart's ""'right atrium'' or ''left atrium'' may result in flutter or ''fibrillation'' QRS waves. No one knows for sure what triggers either atrial flutter or AFib. However, many doctors and other health care professionals suggest that the risk factors for these two arrhythmias are essentially the same and function as probable causes of the two heart problems. Unfortunately, there are many risk factors for flutter and fibrillation:' Hypertension (high blood pressure) Diabetes Heart failure Obesity Any serious acute illness (myocardial 
and/or ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy) Advanced age Recent surgery Chronic lung disease Binge alcohol intake or continual heavy 
alcohol use Hyperthyroidism Stress Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (20% may 
develop flutter and 7% may develop fibrillation) "
"What is the difference between the treatments for atrial flutter and atrial 
fibrillation?","'In general, because these two arrhythmias are similar in their potential causes, the American Heart Association suggests the same treatment guidelines for both AFib and atrial flutter. The goal of any of these treatments is to return the heart to a normal condition, removal of signals to generate the arrhythmias. ''In some individuals, vagal maneuvers like bearing down to have a bowel movement or administration of an IV dose of adenosine may stop atrial flutter. They do not work well for treatment or conversion or stoppage of AFib. However, other medications and procedures are virtually identical (dosage may vary) for treatment of flutter and fibrillation according to the American Heart Association. Medications include antidysrhythmics and ''beta blockers''. ''Anticoagulants'' are used prevent blood clots (thromboembolic problems). ''Procedures include electrical ''cardioversion'', ablation (radio wave ablation, laser ablation, freezing ablation techniques) of abnormal atrial tissue generating electrical impulses and other surgical techniques such as generation of ''scar'' formation (Maze procedure) to block or eliminate abnormal P wave or irregular QRS complex formation in some individuals that are refractory to more common treatments.'  "
Can either of these conditions be prevented?,"'Unfortunately, these two problems are difficult to prevent because there are so many potential causes and risk factors associated with them. Some risk factors you cannot change; for example, age over 60, family members with one of the conditions, and being a white male. However, most organizations like the American Heart Association publish suggestions to reduce risk, which include:' Get regular physical activity. Eat a heart 
	healthy diet, low in salt, 
saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Avoid excessive amounts of alcohol and 
caffeine. Don't smoke. Maintain a healthy weight. Treat underlying diseases like high blood pressure, sleep apnea, 
	hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or any disease of the heart 
(especially heart attack, heart valve disease or heart failure). Individuals with risk factors they cannot change are especially encouraged to 
reduce risk by following these suggestions."
What is the prognosis for someone with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter?,"""The prognosis and life expectancy for patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation depends on the patient's underlying condition. Individuals with complicated medical conditions and poor response to medications or procedures have a poorer prognosis. Patients with atrial flutter may have slightly better prognosis than patients with ""'atrial fibrillation''. However, patients with either arrhythmia that undergo ablation have an excellent prognosis with a very low recurrence rate. Ablation can allow a patient to have a normal rhythm with a normal ventricular rate (normal heart rate) and a return to normal heart health.' "
"What does ""fibrillation"" mean?","'Atrial fibrillation'' and ventricular ''fibrillation'' are ''heart'' conditions that include the term “''fibrillation''.” When defined as related to the heart, ""''fibrillation''"" refers to a very rapid irregular contractions of the heart’s muscle fibers.' "
What are the main differences between AFib and VFib?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' or ''AFib'', and ventricular ''fibrillation'' or VFib, are both a type of abnormal heart rhythm or heartbeat called an ''arrhythmia''.'""One of the main differences between these two heart conditions is that ventricular fibrillation is life threatening if treatment isn't begun immediately, while ""'atrial fibrillation'' generally is not immediately life threatening, but can cause problems with the ''heart function'' that are very dangerous if not treated effectively.'   AFib produces irregular electrical signals in the upper chambers of the heart muscle called the atria (and may include the AV node), causing the heart’s atria to beat irregularly and usually faster than normal. AFib usually is not an immediately life-threatening abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia). VFib produces irregular electrical signals in the lower chamber heart muscles (ventricles) that are so chaotic that the heart muscles can’t pump blood effectively. This type of heart condition is life threatening, and must be treated immediately or the person will likely die."
What are the main similarities between these two heart conditions?,"'Both types of ''heart disease'' are a type of abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia). AFib and VFib can be detected by ''ECG''’s and CPR defibrillators (machines that can identify arrhythmias and, if needed, can deliver shocks, or electrical impulses, to the heart to treat a life-threatening arrhythmia like VFib).' "
"What are AFib and VFib, and how do they affect the heart?","'To understand AFib and VFib, you need to know a little about your heart and how it normally works. The heart is composed of four muscular chambers, two upper and two lower. The two upper chambers are called the atria. The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.''AFib and VFib are both termed arrhythmias (''abnormal heart rhythms'').''AFib is a type of arrhythmia termed supraventricular tachycardia'', meaning that the problem occurs above the ventricles. For AFib, the ''abnormal heart rhythms'' are due to irregular electrical activity in the atria, mainly the right ''atrium''. It usually results in a fast and irregular heartbeat.''In contrast, ''VFib occurs when the electrical signal is chaotic'' within the ventricular muscular tissue and results in no effective heartbeat so there is no effective ''blood pressure'' or pulse generated, which results in ''sudden cardiac death'' of the individual if the abnormal heartbeat continues and is not treated immediately (immediately).' The impulse is first generated at the sinoatrial node (SA node), which causes the right atrium to contract sending blood to the right ventricle. The right ventricle then sends blood to the lungs to get rid of carbon dioxide (CO2) and to pick up oxygen (02). The lungs then return the fresh oxygenated blood to the left atrium, which contracts to fill the left ventricle. The left ventricle muscle tissue contracts, and generates the pulse and sends fresh oxygenated blood under pressure (blood pressure) to your body’s organs. Each heartbeat repeats the process, and normally produces an electrical signal that is consistent for each heartbeat. When the electrical signal is irregular in any way, the patient has an abnormal heart rhythm."
Is AFib or VFib more serious and dangerous?,"""By far, VFib is more serious. If ventricular fibrillation isn't treated immediately, the patient will have a “sudden death” or “""'cardiac arrest''” and die.' "
Differences between how AFib and VFib feel to a person (signs and symptoms),"'A person with AFib may have no symptoms, but in general, they may notice an irregular and rapid heartbeat. Other symptoms that may occur are:''In contrast, ventricular fibrillation (VFib) has very short-lived signs and symptoms.''About an hour so before the person suddenly collapses due to ventricular fibrillation, some people may have these signs and symptoms.'  Fatigue (especially when exercising) A fluttering or thumping in the chest Weakness Dizziness Shortness of breath Anxiety Feel like you are going to faint Confusion Chest discomfort or pain (if you have this use extreme caution, call 911 in case you are having a heart attack) Sudden collapse Fainting with no response to stimulation (loss of consciousness) No or weak, erratic pulse Death if not treated immediately Dizziness Nausea Shortness of breath Chest pain and/or tachycardia"
What causes these two heart diseases?,"'Many underlying medical problems may contribute to the development of AFib and/or VFib. Some causes that are common to both heart conditions include:' Heart or cardiovascular disease Cardiomyopathy Drugs Alcohol consumption High cholesterol levels Increasing age A diet containing high levels of animal fat (meat) Severe infections High blood pressure Metabolic imbalances Stimulants (medications, caffeine, nicotine) Stress"
How do the EKG patterns differ for AFib and VFib?,"'The ''EKG'' patterns in most cases are diagnostic for AFib and/or VFib because of the characteristic wave forms each produce.''Normal ''ECG'' wave strip pattern''Atrial fibrillation'' ECG''AFib shows ''irregular P wave patterns (the small “spike” just before the QRS or big spike pattern), which indicates irregular atrial contractions interrupted by QRS patterns (heartbeats or effective ventricular cardiac blood pumping).''ECG (''electrocardiogram'' or ''EKG'') of VFib shows only fast irregular electrical tracings with no tracings showing a QRS (the large “spike” pattern on a normal ECG) indicative of a heartbeat (ventricular contraction).' "
What is the treatment for AFib and VFib?,"'Atrial fibrillation''\xa0may automatically revert to normal sinus rhythm and require no treatment, in a few people. Many people with AFib can be treated with heart rate controlling or rhythm-controlling medications (see ''prevention''). Moreover, some people with AFib may respond well to electrical ''cardioversion''. This is performed by giving the heart an electrical ''shock'' that results in resetting the heart’s normal electric pattern. Ablation techniques destroy malfunctioning heart tissue responsible for the abnormal atrial electrical activity.''Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency'' heart condition that requires immediate therapy. VFib can be treated with an electrical ''shock'' to the heart with a ''defibrillator''. While a ''defibrillator'' is being located, CPR (''cardiopulmonary resuscitation'') with chest compressions is used to keep the person alive until a defibrillator shock terminates VFib. This allows the heart to produce an effective electrical current that causes the ventricular function to become organized enough to pump blood (for example, return to normal cardiac rhythm). Ventricular fibrillation may be the end signs of a dying heart and may be difficult to treat in some instances. ''Defibrillation'' in these cases may not work and the patient may die due to ''cardiac arrest''.' "
Is it possible to prevent these heart conditions?," Medications such as antiarrhythmic drugs (beta blockers) Implantable devices (cardioverter – defibrillator or ICD) that detect VFib and automatically shock the heart; and treatment for underlying problems like coronary artery disease (for example, angioplasty, stent placement and/or coronary artery bypass surgery). These treatments may reduce the chance of sudden death from VFib. Rhythm and rate controlling drugs Ablation techniques to destroy cardiac tissue that is generating abnormal electrical patterns Pacemaker to regulate the heartbeat in case the electrical activity the heart starts becoming too fast or too slow A surgical technique termed the Maze procedure may be performed in which a surgeon creates small cuts in the heart to form scars that interfere with electrical impulses that can cause AFib."
What’s the life expectancy for someone with AFib or VFib?,"'Underlying causes usually determine the life expectancy in people with AFib. People who are treated for the causes or triggers of AFib (for example, alcohol intake, metabolic problems, ''coronary artery disease'', ''sepsis'' and many others), usually will have a normal life expectancy. Those who respond poorly to treatments will have a poorer prognosis.''VFib needs immediate treatment (CPR and ''defibrillation'') or the person will likely die within a few minutes. However, if it VFib is treated immediately, it may reduce the chances of having another\xa0VFib. In people who survive VFib, the survival rate and life expectancy is similar to AFib if the causes and triggers of VFib are treated and managed.\xa0' "

Medications to treat and manage atrial flutter,"'There are three types of ''drugs'' used to treat atrial flutter.''Antiarrhythmics:'' slows or interferes with the electric signals that produce atrial flutter; examples are:''Beta-Blockers'': '""slow the heart's ventricular response to atrial signals by slowing the AV nodal conduction; examples are:""'Anticoagulants'':'' used to prevent thromboembolic complications (''blood clots''); examples are:''The choices of medication(s) to use is based on your medical condition. These medications should be discussed with your doctor or other health care professional before you take them.'   propafenone (Rythmol) flecainide (Tambocor) amiodarone (Cordarone) dronedarone (Multaq) sotalol (Betapace) dofetilide (Tikosyn) diltiazem (Cardizem) verapamil (Calan) digoxin (Lanoxin) metoprolol (Lopressor) esmolol (Brevibloc) atenolol (Tenormin) warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) heparin dabigatran (Pradaxa) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxaban (Xarelto)"
What procedures treat and manage atrial flutter?,"'The procedures used for the treatment and management atrial flutter are varied; however, the goals are similar - restoration of sinus rhythm, control of ventricular rate prevention of recurrent episodes, prevention of thrombus formation - all with minimizing adverse effects from therapy.'""In patients that are stable, vagal maneuvers such as holding your breath and bearing down (like having a bowel movement) may be effective. Other procedures may need to be considered depending on individual patient's situation, for example, immediate electrical ""'cardioversion'' is used for patients who have severe symptoms and are unstable. For patients that are stable but still have episodes of atrial flutter, ''radiofrequency ablation'' of the circular pathway in the heart can be done as an elective procedure. Other procedures or heart abnormalities may cause a few patients to need a ''pacemaker'' to control the heart rate.''Although some patients may recover completely and remain in a sinus rhythm, others may require additional therapy to prevent thromboembolic (''blood clots'') complications with ''anticoagulant'' medication.' "
Can atrial flutter be prevented?,"'Atrial flutter can be prevented or the risk of it decreased by reducing the factors that may trigger it. The simplest things to do to prevent it are:''If you have underlying health conditions such as lung disease or ''diabetes'', for example, appropriate treatment of these conditions will help decrease the risk or prevent atrial flutter. The ablation procedure may prevent subsequent occurrences of an abnormal heart rhythm like atrial fibrillation and an atrial rate seen in atrial flutter and restore relatively normal electrical heart health.' Get regular exercise and be active Eat a heart healthy diet Avoid drinking too much alcohol and/or caffeine. Don't smoke Maintain a healthy weight"
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for atrial flutter?,"""The prognosis and life expectancy for a person with atrial flutter depends on the patient's underlying condition. Those with complicated medical conditions and respond poorly to drugs or procedures have a reduced prognosis. However, patients that undergo successful ablation have an excellent prognosis. Although there is little or no data available on life expectancy with atrial flutter, data from the well-known Framingham heart study suggests that patients with atrial fibrillation, which is closely related to atrial flutter, have a shorter lifespan than normal control individuals although how much shorter is not clear.""'For more clinical information and patient resources, see the Heat Rhythm Society at www.hrsonline.org/.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat atrial flutter?,"'Although primary care physicians can treat a few individuals with uncomplicated atrial flutter, specialists usually are involved in patient care. ''Emergency medicine'' specialists and cardiologists are the main specialists that see and treat this type of arrhythmia. Cardiac electrophysiologists specialize in diagnosis and treatment of the electrical activity of the heart.' "
"What is atrial flutter, and what is atrial fibrillation (definitions)?","'Atrial flutter'' is a type of atrial tachycardia that results in an ''arrhythmia'' (rhythm disorder or not a normal rhythm) where the atria of the ''heart'' beat too quickly in a fast, usually regular, rhythm. ''Atrial fibrillation'' is another type of atrial tachycardia that is closely related to atrial ''flutter''. However, the arrhythmia that occurs in ''AFib'' is much more chaotic and results in a fast and usually very irregular heart rhythm or a atypical and irregular ventricular rate that can effect heart health.'  "
"Are atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation the same thing?","'Atrial flutter'', ''atrial fibrillation'"" (AFib), and atrial tachycardia are not the same things. However, all three terms have in common a rapid heart rate that can be felt when a person feels their pulse. Atrial tachycardia is a general term that indicates a cardiac condition where the rate of contraction of the heart's atria is fast and not normal, but does not describe the type of heart rhythm other than fast. Atrial tachycardia's are also termed supraventricular tachycardia's and are a type of ""'cardiac arrhythmia'' that usually result in a fast heartbeat, even at rest.''In contrast, atrial flutter and AFib are two of the main types of atrial tachycardia. They are distinguished by the different patterns of abnormal electrical impulses generated in the atria; a regular pattern for atrial flutter and an irregular pattern for AFib. Both are considered an abnormal heart rhythm and not good for heart health, and both have the potential to decrease the overall health of the patient.' "
What are the differences in how atrial flutter and AFib affect the heart (ECG wave strip patterns)?,"'Atrial flutter is a health condition that causes the atria of the heart to have a conduction or electrical problem that result in a re-entry loop in a regular pattern the causes the atria to beat at a rapid rate of about 240-360 beats per minute (bpm). The atrial flutter waves are regular and on an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'') are seen as P waves in a regular ""saw tooth"" pattern (small P waves in succession with short or no intervals between each wave). Often, the flutter waves are not completely transferred through the ''AV node'"" to the ventricular heart chambers so occasionally electrical conduction blocks occur and produce a 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1 ventricular contraction rate that is mainly regular. The most common atrial flutter occurs when the atria beat at a rate of 300 bpm and ventricular contraction rate is 150 bpm (2:1 conduction). Infrequently, some patients with flutter waves may also have bradycardia because the heart's ventricles are not receiving most of the flutter P waves. Flutter waves may come and go spontaneously in some patients. Atrial flutter is the second most common tachyarrhythmia.""'Atrial fibrillation'' is the most common tachyarrhythmia. The incidence is about 27-28 per 1000 person years. AFib is a ''heart disease'' that causes the atria of the heart to have a conduction or electrical problem that results in a chaotic, irregular production of irregular QRS waves with no P waves. In contrast to flutter waves, the abnormal conduction creates irregular, rapid occurring QRS waves, some of which are conducted to the heart ventricles through the ''AV node''. This results in the heart having ventricular contractions that are irregular, variable in effective blood pumping and usually range from about 100-175 bpm.'""ECG of the heart's abnormal electrical problem in AFib""""ECG\xa0of the Abnormal Conduction of the Hear'ts Electrical System in AFib\xa0""""Picture of the heart's abnormal electrical conduction in AFib"" "
"Which heart condition is more serious, atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation?","'Both heart diseases have the potential of becoming serious. However, many doctors and other health care professionals consider atrial flutter to be less serious than ''atrial fibrillation'' because flutter symptoms tend to be less severe and flutter waves have a less risk of embolization (clot formation). In addition, flutter waves also tend to revert back to sinus rhythm spontaneously more often in some patients.' "
"What's the difference between how these two heart conditions feel (symptoms); 
can you feel atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation?","""The difference between atrial flutter and AFib in terms of feeling are very similar. However, if the person can have someone (or even themselves) feel a pulse, if the pulse is regular even though it's fast, the problem is probably atrial flutter. If the pulse is fast and irregular, then the person is more likely to have AFib.""'Although some people have no symptoms and cannot feel the arrhythmias, common clinical symptoms of both arrhythmias are:''Serious symptoms may include the following:'   Palpitations (person feels their heart 
beating or pounding) Fatigue Shortness of breath Feeling like you going to faint Blurry vision Lightheadedness Heart skipping beats More severe shortness of breath Sweating Chest pain Fainting or loss of consciousness"
"Do the causes and risk factors for atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation 
differ?","'Any damage to the healthy electrical ''pacemaker'"" in the heart's ""'right atrium'' or ''left atrium'' may result in flutter or ''fibrillation'' QRS waves. No one knows for sure what triggers either atrial flutter or AFib. However, many doctors and other health care professionals suggest that the risk factors for these two arrhythmias are essentially the same and function as probable causes of the two heart problems. Unfortunately, there are many risk factors for flutter and fibrillation:' Hypertension (high blood pressure) Diabetes Heart failure Obesity Any serious acute illness (myocardial 
and/or ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy) Advanced age Recent surgery Chronic lung disease Binge alcohol intake or continual heavy 
alcohol use Hyperthyroidism Stress Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (20% may 
develop flutter and 7% may develop fibrillation) "
"What is the difference between the treatments for atrial flutter and atrial 
fibrillation?","'In general, because these two arrhythmias are similar in their potential causes, the American Heart Association suggests the same treatment guidelines for both AFib and atrial flutter. The goal of any of these treatments is to return the heart to a normal condition, removal of signals to generate the arrhythmias. ''In some individuals, vagal maneuvers like bearing down to have a bowel movement or administration of an IV dose of adenosine may stop atrial flutter. They do not work well for treatment or conversion or stoppage of AFib. However, other medications and procedures are virtually identical (dosage may vary) for treatment of flutter and fibrillation according to the American Heart Association. Medications include antidysrhythmics and ''beta blockers''. ''Anticoagulants'' are used prevent blood clots (thromboembolic problems). ''Procedures include electrical ''cardioversion'', ablation (radio wave ablation, laser ablation, freezing ablation techniques) of abnormal atrial tissue generating electrical impulses and other surgical techniques such as generation of ''scar'' formation (Maze procedure) to block or eliminate abnormal P wave or irregular QRS complex formation in some individuals that are refractory to more common treatments.'  "
Can either of these conditions be prevented?,"'Unfortunately, these two problems are difficult to prevent because there are so many potential causes and risk factors associated with them. Some risk factors you cannot change; for example, age over 60, family members with one of the conditions, and being a white male. However, most organizations like the American Heart Association publish suggestions to reduce risk, which include:' Get regular physical activity. Eat a heart 
	healthy diet, low in salt, 
saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. Avoid excessive amounts of alcohol and 
caffeine. Don't smoke. Maintain a healthy weight. Treat underlying diseases like high blood pressure, sleep apnea, 
	hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or any disease of the heart 
(especially heart attack, heart valve disease or heart failure). Individuals with risk factors they cannot change are especially encouraged to 
reduce risk by following these suggestions."
What is the prognosis for someone with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter?,"""The prognosis and life expectancy for patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation depends on the patient's underlying condition. Individuals with complicated medical conditions and poor response to medications or procedures have a poorer prognosis. Patients with atrial flutter may have slightly better prognosis than patients with ""'atrial fibrillation''. However, patients with either arrhythmia that undergo ablation have an excellent prognosis with a very low recurrence rate. Ablation can allow a patient to have a normal rhythm with a normal ventricular rate (normal heart rate) and a return to normal heart health.' "
What is spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of several hereditary diseases that progressively destroy lower motor neurons-nerve cells in the brain stem and spinal cord that control essential voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing. Lower motor neurons control movement in the arms, legs, chest, face, throat, and tongue.''When there are disruptions in the signals between lower motor neurons and muscles, the muscles gradually weaken and may begin wasting away and develop uncontrollable twitching (called fasciculations). When there are disruptions in the signals between the upper motor neurons (located in the brain) and the lower motor neurons, the limb muscles develop ''stiffness'' (called ''spasticity''), movements become slow and effortful, and tendon reflexes such as knee and ankle jerks become overactive. Over time, the ability to control voluntary movement can be lost.' "
What are the types and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy in children is classified into three types, based on ages of onset, severity, and progression of symptoms. All three types are caused by defects in the SMN1 gene.''Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy include:'  Spinal muscular atrophy type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy, is evident by the time a child is 6 months old. Symptoms may include hypotonia (severely reduced muscle tone), diminished limb movements, lack of tendon reflexes, fasciculations, tremors, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and impaired breathing. Some children also develop scoliosis (curvature of the spine) or other skeletal abnormalities. Affected children never sit or stand and the vast majority usually die of respiratory failure before the age of 2. However, the survival rate in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type I has increased in recent years, in relation to the growing trend toward more proactive clinical care. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type II, the intermediate form, usually begin between 6 and 18 months of age. Children may be able to sit without support but are unable to stand or walk unaided, and may have respiratory difficulties, including an increased risk of respiratory infections. The progression of disease is variable. Life expectancy is reduced but some individuals live into adolescence or young adulthood. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease) appear between 2 and 17 years of age and include abnormal gait; difficulty running, climbing steps, or rising from a chair; and a fine tremor of the fingers. The lower extremities are most often affected. Complications include scoliosis and joint contractures-chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, caused by abnormal muscle tone and weakness, which prevents the joints from moving freely. Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type III may be prone to respiratory infections, but with care may have a normal lifespan. Congenital spinal muscular atrophy with arthrogryposis (persistent contracture of joints with fixed abnormal posture of the limb) is a rare disorder. Manifestations include severe contractures, scoliosis, chest deformity, respiratory problems, unusually spinal muscular small jaws, and drooping of the upper eyelids. Kennedy's disease, also known as progressive spinobulbar muscular atrophy, may first be recognized between 15 and 60 years of age. The onset of symptoms varies and includes weakness and atrophy of the facial, jaw, and tongue muscles, leading to problems with chewing, swallowing, and changes in speech. Early symptoms may include muscle pain and fatigue. Weakness in arm and leg muscles closest to the trunk of the body develops over time, with muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Individuals with Kennedy's disease also develop sensory loss in the feet and hands. Nerve conduction studies confirm that nearly all individuals have a sensory neuropathy (pain from sensory nerve inflammation or degeneration). Affected individuals may have enlargement of the male breasts or develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
What causes spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by defects in the gene SMN1, which makes a protein that is important for the survival of motor neurons (SMN protein). In spinal muscular atrophy, insufficient levels of the SMN protein lead to degeneration of the lower motor neurons, producing ''weakness'' and wasting of the skeletal muscles. This weakness is often more severe in the trunk and upper leg and arm muscles than in muscles of the hands and ''feet''.' "
How is spinal muscular atrophy inherited?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy disorders in children are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal recessive means the child must inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents. These parents are likely to be asymptomatic (without symptoms of the disease). Autosomal recessive diseases often affect more than one person in the same generation (siblings or cousins).'""Kennedy's disease, an adult form of spinal muscular atrophy is X-linked inherited, which means the mother carries the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and passes the disorder along to her sons. Males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father, while females inherit an X chromosome from each parent. Daughters have a 50 percent chance of inheriting their mother's faulty X chromosome and a safe X chromosome from their father, which would make them asymptomatic carriers of the mutation."" "
How is spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed?,"""A test is available that can indicate whether there are deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene. This test identifies at least 95 percent of spinal muscular atrophy Types I, II, and III. Other diagnostic tests may include electromyography (which records the electrical activity from the brain and/or spinal cord to a peripheral nerve root found in the arms and legs that controls muscles during contraction and at rest), nerve conduction velocity studies (which measure electrical energy by assessing the nerve's ability to send a signal), muscle biopsy (used to diagnose neuromuscular disorders and may also reveal if a person is a carrier of a defective gene that could be passed on to children), and laboratory tests of blood, urine, and other substances."" "
What drugs and lifestyle changes help manage spinal muscular atrophy symptoms and signs? Can it be cured?,"'There is no cure for spinal muscular atrophy. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications.''Muscle relaxants such as ''baclofen'', ''tizanidine'', and the ''benzodiazepines'' may reduce spasticity. Botulinum toxin may be used to treat jaw spasms or ''drooling''. Excessive saliva can be treated with ''amitriptyline'', ''glycopyrrolate'', and ''atropine'' or by botulinum injections into the salivary glands. ''Antidepressants'' may be helpful in treating ''depression''.''Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may help to improve posture, prevent joint immobility, and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Stretching and strengthening exercises may help reduce spasticity, increase range of motion, and keeps circulation flowing. Some individuals require additional therapy for speech, chewing, and swallowing difficulties. Applying heat may relieve muscle ''pain''. Assistive devices such as supports or ''braces'', orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs may help some people retain independence.''Proper ''nutrition'' and a balanced ''diet'' are essential to maintaining weight and strength. People who cannot chew or swallow may require insertion of a feeding tube. Non-invasive ventilation at night can prevent apnea in ''sleep'', and some individuals may also require assisted ventilation due to muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest during daytime.' "
What is the prognosis and lifespan for spinal muscular atrophy?," The prognosis varies depending on the type of spinal muscular atrophy. Some forms of spinal muscular atrophy are fatal. The course of Kennedy's disease varies but is generally slowly progressive. Individuals tend to remain ambulatory until late in the disease. The life expectancy for individuals with Kennedy disease is usually normal. People with spinal muscular atrophy may appear to be stable for long periods, but improvement should not be expected."
What research is being done on spinal muscular atrophy?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts basic, translational, and clinical research on spinal muscular atrophy in laboratories at the NIH and also supports research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.''Cellular and molecular studies seek to understand the mechanisms that trigger motor neurons to degenerate.''Scientists are developing a broad range of model systems in animals and cells to investigate disease processes and expedite the testing of potential therapies. Among these efforts:''NINDS has established the NeuroNext ''clinical trials'' network to promote the rapid development and implementation of trials for neurological disorders that affect adults and/or children. Among its goals, the network is designed to develop early-phase trials aimed at identifying biomarkers-usually a physical trait or substance in the blood or other bodily fluids that can be measured to determine the presence and severity of a disease-and testing promising, emerging therapies. One of the first projects in this new network will hope to identify biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, which could speed the development of effective treatments for the disease.' Scientists have used gene therapy to halt motor neuron destruction and slow disease progression in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy. The NINDS supports research to further explore this method and to provide a path toward clinical tests in patients. Scientists have found that a specific class of compounds referred to as anti-sense oligonucleotides can either block or correct the processing of RNA molecules, which are the intermediates between genes and proteins. These compounds have shown therapeutic promise in model systems of spinal muscular atrophy. Animal models of spinal muscular atrophy represent critical tools in discovering and developing new therapies for spinal muscular atrophy. Scientists have developed new zebrafish, mouse, and pig models, including models of less severe spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3, which may greatly facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and candidate therapies."
Facts you should know about vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy," Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during the menopause (the time after menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Vaginal atrophy occurs due to falling estrogen levels. Vaginal atrophy may be associated with vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, and/or pain during sexual intercourse. Hormone therapy can be effective in treating vaginal atrophy and other menopausal symptoms, but hormone therapy carries its own risks. Local vaginal hormone creams or vaginal lubricants are alternatives to systemic hormone therapy."
What causes vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during ''menopause'' (the time when menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Prior to ''menopause'', the vaginal lining appears plump, bright red, and moist. As estrogen levels decline, the lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier, light pink to bluish in color, and less elastic. This is a normal change that is noticed by many perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women.''Estrogen levels begin to fall as the ''menopause'' approaches. ''Estrogens'' are mainly produced by the ovaries. ''Estrogens'' control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. Estrogens also play a significant role in the regulation of the ''menstrual cycle'' and ''pregnancy''.''Most women reach ''menopause'' between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can occur earlier or later in life. The ''menopause'' average age is 51 years old. Every woman is different, and there is no definitive way to predict when an individual woman will enter menopause. Also, women in the menopausal transition experience symptoms with varying degrees of severity. Not all perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women will have the same symptoms or experience the same levels of severity.'  "
What symptoms can be associated with vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Other vaginal symptoms that are commonly associated with vaginal atrophy include ''vaginal dryness'', ''itching'', irritation, and/or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse (known as dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections.''In addition to the vaginal symptoms, women may experience other symptoms of the menopausal transition. ''Hot flashes'', ''night sweats'', ''mood changes'', ''fatigue'',  ''urinary tract infections'', ''urinary incontinence'', ''acne'', memory problems, and unwanted hair growth. '  "
How do medical professionals diagnose vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal symptoms such as ''itching'', dryness, or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse are\xa0typically sufficient to assume that a woman is suffering from vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy if she is experiencing other symptoms consistent with the menopausal transition. Of course, a careful physical examination, including a pelvic examination, is necessary to rule out other conditions (such as infections) that may be causing vaginal symptoms.''There are no specific tests available to determine whether the vaginal wall has become thinner or less elastic.' "
What treatments are available for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal dryness and atrophy do not need to be treated unless they cause symptoms or discomfort. Women who experience symptoms have several treatment options.''Hormone therapy (HT) is effective in treating vaginal dryness/vaginal atrophy. HT has also been referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'') or postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT). HT has been shown to effectively reduce vaginal dryness as well as help control ''hot flashes'' associated with menopause.''However, HT is not without its risks. Long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women who took oral combined hormone therapy containing both estrogen and ''progesterone'' showed that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive it.''Women taking oral estrogen alone had an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for ''heart attack'' or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''HT may be administered in pill form or transdermally (patches or sprays from which the medication is absorbed through the skin). Transdermal\xa0estrogens enter the circulation directly, where oral estrogen products must first pass through the ''liver'' from the stomach. Since transdermal hormone products do not have effects on the ''liver'', this route of administration has become the preferred form for most women. A number of preparations are available for oral and transdermal forms of HT, varying in the both type and amount of hormones in the products.''So-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women has been a source of much attention in recent years. Bioidentical hormone preparations are hormones with the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body but which are produced in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. While some of these preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. Since individually compounded products cannot be standardized, these individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA. There is no evidence that bioidentical preparations provide superior symptom relief. Studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not yet been carried out.'""No matter what form of therapy is used, the decision about hormone therapy should take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history and the severity of her symptoms. Current recommendations state that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time.""'There are also local, topical (meaning applied directly to the vagina) low-dose hormonal treatments for the symptoms of vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Local treatments include the vaginal estrogen ring, vaginal estrogen cream, or vaginal estrogen tablets. Local (vaginal) estrogen treatments can be very effective in reducing vaginal dryness while having a minimal effect on other tissues in the body.''There is also now a product for vaginal dryness that consists of a daily pill which contains a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). These are theoretically safer than estrogens and can be alternative for some patients.''Vaginal moisturizing agents such as creams or lotions (for example, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer or KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer) as well as the use of lubricants during sexual intercourse are non-hormonal options for managing the discomfort of vaginal dryness. A longer acting moisturizer called Replens is also available over the counter.''Applying Betadine topically on the outer vaginal area, and soaking in a sitz bath or soaking in a bathtub of warm water may be helpful for relieving symptoms of burning and ''vaginal pain'' after intercourse.'  "
What is the prognosis for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"""Vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy are common complaints in postmenopausal women. While these conditions do not produce serious consequences, they are a source of significant discomfort for many women. Hormone treatments are available that are very effective in reducing vaginal dryness, but whether or not to use hormone therapy is an individual decision that must consider the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. Women with only mild symptoms may experience relief by using vaginal moisturizing agents and/or lubricants during sexual intercourse."" "
What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?,"'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'', often called ADHD or ''ADD'' (''attention deficit disorder''), is a behavioral condition that is characterized by symptoms of distractibility, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. This disorder often results in a man or woman having relationship problems, as well as difficulty performing well at work or in their community.' "
How prevalent is adult ADHD?,"'Although it is estimated that 2%-6% of adults have ADHD, this illness begins during childhood. While the condition is assessed more often in boys than in girls, it appears to occur in men and women at equal rates. Nearly two-thirds of ''children with ADHD'' retain some symptoms of the illness as adults, and about half have just as many symptoms of sufficient severity to still qualify for the diagnosis of ADHD. Other key statistics include that more than 90% of adults with the condition describe having trouble focusing, and more than 50% have both distractibility and hyperactivity/impulsivity, while more than one-third have just distractibility.' "
What are causes and risk factors for adult ADHD?,"'While there is no one specific cause for ADHD, there are a number of biologically and socially based risk factors that can increase the likelihood of a person developing the illness. Children with ADHD are more likely to grow into teens and adults with the condition. Brain-imaging studies indicate that traits of the brains of people who have ADHD include a tendency to be smaller, to have less connection between certain areas of the brain, and have less regulation of the neurochemical ''dopamine'' compared to people who do not have the disorder.''In addition to being risk factors for other neuropsychological issues, factors prior to birth that can increase the likelihood of developing ADHD include maternal ''stress'', ''smoking during pregnancy'"", prematurity and low birth weight, as well as an early life stressor in the individual with ADHD. Males and having a family history of this disorder increase the chances that a person will be diagnosed with ADHD. Low family income and low educational achievement for a person's father are social risk factors for developing ADHD."" "
What are adult ADHD symptoms and signs?,"'What is thought to be partly the result of maturity, adults with ADHD may show little to no signs of hyperactivity or the hyperactivity may look more like restlessness and a tendency to become bored easily. For those who do, symptoms and signs of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention may resemble those that are exhibited by children and teens. However, how those symptoms are exhibited tends to vary with age. ''Symptoms of ADHD'' include the following:''While the excessive focus, often described as hyperfocus, is not included as a formal symptom of ADHD, it is often described by people who suffer from this condition or their family members. This symptom is thought by many to be a manifestation of the ineffective focus that is associated with this condition.'   Often makes careless mistakes or pays inadequate attention to detail Trouble focusing during work or leisure activities Does not appear to be listening when spoken to directly Is often unable to complete directions, work tasks, or chores Frequently disorganized when trying to complete a task or activity Has a tendency to avoid, dislike, or resist (procrastinate) engaging in activities that require sustained attention Often loses things that are necessary to complete tasks or activities Easily distracted by extraneous or unrelated stimuli Frequent forgetfulness Frequently fidgety or moves hands or feet Frequently has trouble remaining seated Has a tendency to feel restless Has difficulty participating in leisure activities quietly Performs multiple activities at once Excessive talking Often interrupts others talking Trouble waiting for his or her turn Frequently intrudes on other people Often does something without thinking about it first (behavioral impulsiveness)"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose adult ADHD?,"'According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V''), in order to be diagnosed with ADHD, a child should exhibit six symptoms of inattention or six symptoms of combined hyperactivity and impulsivity, and an older teen or adult need only demonstrate five of each group of symptoms. Diagnostic criteria further state that symptoms should begin prior to 12 years of age, occur in more than one setting (like home and work), be significant enough to cause difficulties for the person, and not be able to be better explained by another illness. There are three types of ADHD: predominately inattentive presentation, predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation, and the combined (inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive) presentation.'""Many health care professionals, like psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health physician's assistants and nurse practitioners, may help diagnose ADHD. A professional will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical exam as part of the evaluation. Since ADHD can be associated with other mental health conditions, like ""'depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', ''obsessive compulsive disorder'', and other ''anxiety'' disorders, as well as with ''autism''-spectrum disorders, the evaluator will likely screen for signs of those and other forms of ''mental illness''. The signs and symptoms of ''adult ADHD'"" may also be caused by many medical conditions or can be a side effect of a number of medications. Therefore, blood tests are frequently done as part of the initial assessment. Occasionally, an imaging study like an X-ray or CAT scan may be necessary. As part of the evaluation, the individual may be asked questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to assist in determining the diagnosis. Some ADHD symptom checklists for children have been adapted to screen for the condition in adults. Examples of such diagnostic tools include the Conners' ""'Adult ADHD'' Rating Scale (CAARS) and the Adult Self Report Scale.'  "
What is the treatment for adult ADHD? What are adult ADHD medications?,"'Treatments for ADHD in adults that do not involve medication include education about the illness, participation in an ADHD support group, and instructional training for a number of issues, including career counseling, organizational skills building, parent counseling, financial training, and development of time-management skills. Many people with this condition may benefit from cognitive ''behavior therapy'', a form of ''psychotherapy'' that seeks to help the individual alter patterns of thinking that may interfere with their functioning.''As with the treatment of ''ADHD in children'', adults often benefit from being treated with a stimulant medication. Commonly, the first prescribed stimulant for the treatment of this condition in children is a derivative of ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') or ''dextroamphetamine'' (''Dexedrine''). Given the longer days and increased responsibilities that adolescents and adults have compared to young children, longer-acting ''stimulants'' are usually prescribed. Examples of those medications include long-acting methylphenidate, like ''Daytrana'' patches, ''Concerta'', ''Quillivant XR'', and ''dexmethylphenidate'' (''Focalin''-XR), as well as the long-acting amphetamine salt ''narcolepsy''Adults whose symptoms early in the morning or late in the evening are an issue, or whom have a history or propensity to a ''drug use disorder'', stimulants may not be the optimal medication treatment and, therefore, they may respond better to a nonstimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. Side effects like low appetite, trouble sleeping, ''tremors'', emotional inhibition, irritability or ''depression'', less frequently ''tics'', and rarely ''hallucinations'' may make taking a stimulant medication unwise. Using a stimulant to treat ADHD in people who have no history of ''drug abuse'' tends to decrease the likelihood of their ever developing a ''substance abuse'' problem. However, people with a recent history of ''alcohol'' or other ''drug abuse'' may want to avoid the small but possible ''addiction'' potential of stimulant medication. The long-term impact of addiction to a stimulant may be serious, potentially resulting in having a ''stroke'' or ''heart attack''. Individuals who either had less-than-optimal effects or had significant side effects to taking stimulants may respond better to a nonstimulant medication like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv''), ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'' or ''Kapvay''), or ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera''), or to taking the prescription supplement phosphatidylserine-''omega-3'' (Vayarin), which has a specialized delivery system compared to ''over-the-counter'' preparations of the omega-3 supplement.''People with ADHD are more likely to develop mood problems as adults. They therefore may benefit from medications like ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') or ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') that treat both ADHD and ''depression'' or ''anxiety''.'

Are there any home remedies for adult ADHD?,'Further research is needed to determine the potential effectiveness of natural remedies for treating adult ADHD. Examples of such remedies include dietary restrictions and vitamin ''supplements''. The limited research available on the effectiveness of these remedies does not usually include studies on adults.''Lifestyle changes that have been found to be useful in reducing some symptoms of ADHD in children and may be considered for adults include regular ''exercise'' and improving ''sleep'' every night.' 
What are complications of adult ADHD?,"'Adults living with ADHD are more likely to have low self-esteem, ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and are not as adaptive with their social abilities compared to adults without the illness. The presence of other mental health disorders (co-morbidity) is more likely in adults who are hyperactive and/or impulsive as opposed to being distractible as part of ADHD. Adults with this condition are also more at risk for underachievement in school or at work, being in more car accidents, using tobacco products or other ''drugs'', having problems managing their anger, and are more likely to develop antisocial behaviors, particularly if not treated. Given the cost effectiveness of treating ADHD and the potentially dire consequences of this illness going undiagnosed and untreated, the importance of identifying ADHD is clear.''ADHD adults tend to have more marital problems, as well as troubles getting along with peers and authority figures. They may, therefore, become isolated socially.''Adults with ADHD are at risk for completing fewer years of education compared to their non-ADHD counterparts. They are often more interested in careers for which forgetfulness is less of an obstacle for good performance, as well as those that provide immediate gratification and other forms of excitement, like sales. They are often at risk for procrastinating on tasks, frequently changing jobs, and losing more jobs.' "
What is the prognosis of adult ADHD?,"'The prognosis for ADHD adults seems to be influenced by the severity of symptoms, scores on intelligence tests, whether the person with the condition has other mental health problems, as well as if there are family issues, such as parental mental health problems, family problems, socioeconomic challenges, and if the individual with ADHD receives treatment. Studies show that stimulant treatment of this condition often improves the prognosis for adults, decreasing the risk for developing other psychiatric problems, failing in school and in the world of work.' "
Is it possible to prevent adult ADHD?,"'Research indicates that ''breastfeeding'' up to 6 months of age may help prevent the development of ADHD. Since environmental and social problems like ''drug use'' in the mother, medical, and emotional challenges increase the likelihood of developing this condition, ''prevention'"" or treatment of those issues can help prevent ADHD. In addition, early treatment of children with ADHD can decrease the impact the illness has on the individual's life into adulthood."" "

What is teenage ADHD?," Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic disorders affecting school-age children. Current research indicates prevalence rates of 3%-5% with males being diagnosed with this disorder two and a half times more often than females. ADHD is described as ""a common neurobiologic disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity."" A more academic description is found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-V). This handbook of mental health disorders indicates that ADHD is characterized as ""a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals of comparable levels of development."" ADHD manifestations may be subdivided into three presentations:predominately inattentive,predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity, andcombined presentation. predominately inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity/impulsivity, and combined presentation. Originally thought to be ""outgrown"" by adulthood, current studies indicate that approximately 60%-80% of patients diagnosed as children will meet diagnostic criteria during adolescence and adulthood."
"What 
are risk factors and causes of ADHD in teens?","'ADHD is a disruption of neurocognitive functioning without a single cause. Current research is utilizing powerful neuroimaging techniques (for example, functional ''MRI'') and has developed intriguing hypotheses of neurochemical dysfunction of the brain as a cause of ADHD behaviors. Regions of the brain felt to be responsible for executive functioning, problem solving, as well as goal seeking and impulsivity may function differently in those individuals with ADHD when compared to those without the diagnosis. Interestingly, regions of the brain not felt to be associated with ADHD behaviors may also be different when individuals with ADHD are compared to people not experiencing ''ADHD symptoms''. While these theories may have interesting research implications, a more conventional approach utilizes both a mental-health evaluation and a thorough physical examination in determining the diagnosis of ADHD and providing a rational treatment program. There is clear evidence of a hereditary predisposition toward ADHD. ''Children with ADHD'' are more likely to have a parent or nonidentical twin sibling with the same diagnosis. An even higher likelihood exists when considering identical twins.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose ADHD in teens? Are there ADHD tests?,"'Primary to establishing a diagnosis of ADHD is the demonstration of symptoms detailed in the criteria of the ''DSM-V''. Collecting information from both parents and teachers is crucial. Various rating scales (for example, Connors Scales) are objective and efficient to complete. Part of the evaluation for an individual for possible ADHD involves a thorough search for other associated (but not causative) mental health disorders including (but not limited to) learning disorders, mood disorders, and more. By definition, it is crucial to exclude other causes of the ADHD symptom complex. This umbrella may include' adverse effects of medication, a medical problem (like hyperactive thyroid functioning), mental deficiency, and psychiatric disorders (for example, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder)."
What are the symptoms of ADHD in teens?,"'Several of the behaviors displayed in ''childhood ADHD'' carry through to the teen and even adult years. The manifestations may be more subtle and/or ""hidden"" due to the more mature coping mechanisms as well as the need to adapt to the expected behavior society demands with more advanced age. Studies have noted the following list of potential symptoms for adolescent ADHD patients:''Besides the obvious and expected academic and social problems these behaviors may engender, there is other ""fallout"" which may have even more severe consequences. These may include the following:'  Lack of focus: easy distractibility, overlooking details, not completing projects/assignments ""Hyperfocus"": intense focus that excludes similarly timed tasks or other individuals to the detriment of the ADHD sufferer Disorganization: procrastination, lateness, and difficult prioritizing Forgetfulness: may be misinterpreted as carelessness or lack of investment Impulsivity: interrupts conversations, performs socially inappropriate behaviors, and ignores consequences of acts Emotionalism: irritability and/or broad mood swings Poor self-image: may be hypercritical and hold self to unreasonably high standards Lack of motivation: coupled with procrastination and poor organizational skills leads to major problems at home, work, and school Physical and/or mental restlessness: taps toes, plays with pens/pencils, clears throat recurrently, and becomes bored easily Risk for car accidents: The combination of teenage invincibility that may be above and beyond their age/developmental-level peers, coupled with trouble focusing, impatience, excessive impulsivity, risk taking, and thrill-seeking behaviors underscore why ADHD teens are two to four more times likely to have an automobile accident than their non-ADHD affected peers. Alcohol consumption: Teens with ADHD are more likely to engage in drinking as well as drinking excessively. Several studies have documented that such teens are twice as likely to have consumed alcohol to excess (possibly leading to passing out) in the last six months compared to non-ADHD affected adolescents. Illicit drugs: Teens with ADHD are more likely to abuse drugs other than marijuana than teens not diagnosed with ADHD."
How does ADHD in teens affect executive function?,"'The frontal lobes of the brain are located directly behind the forehead and are not felt to be functionally fully mature until an individual is 22-25 years of age. A major role of this brain region is to provide executive function. While older teens generally do not have fully matured frontal lobes, adolescents with ADHD may carry an extra burden of less maturity of this region and thus have even more problems with executive function.''The basic task of executive function is to facilitate formulation and execution of a plan to achieve a goal. Executive function involves the ability to manage several tasks. These include time management, ignoring unnecessary (extraneous) information, switching focus from one task to another, prioritizing, planning and organizing tasks to achieve a goal, remembering details, controlling inappropriate speech and/or behaviors, and integrating past experiences with the current task at hand. Specialists in human behavior subdivide executive function into two elements:''An example of utilizing executive function might take place at dessert time in a restaurant. A large piece of ''chocolate'' cake is enticing, and the memory of prior pieces of chocolate cake provides a temptation (organization). However, remembering the excessive amount of calories the cake provides and your desire to lose 5 pounds enables you to skip dessert (regulation).''Teens with poorly managed executive function will commonly have problems with planning projects, memorizing information and integrating it into a subject area, estimating the time necessary to complete a project, and initiating and coordinating activities or tasks.' Organization: ""gathering information and structuring it for evaluation"" Regulation: ""taking stock of the environment and changing behavior in response to it"""
What kinds of difficulties do teens with ADHD face?,"'Teenagers with ADHD will commonly have problems with relationships (parents and peers), academic and nonacademic (for example, sports and employment) success, and self-esteem. It is important to include the teen when discussing management of his or her ADHD. Accepting the diagnosis of ADHD can be a major hurdle. A teen\'s sense of self-identity requires fitting in seamlessly with peers; this goal of blending in may be disrupted and the adolescent may feel that he or she has been ""labeled"" and thus ostracized. Helping the teen to appreciate his or her strengths and that there are options which will help to ""level the playing field"" will actually enable him or her to better fit in with their non-ADHD affected peers. The analogy of wearing glasses may help to make the point. The glasses merely enable the wearer to see as well as those whose vision is not impacted. Management of ADHD is merely designed to return the teen back to the baseline his or her contemporaries currently experience.' "
What are nonmedical treatment strategies for teen ADHD?,"'Nonmedical management strategies for the adolescent with ADHD include the following:'  Provide fair, clear, and consistent expectations, direction, and limits. Follow a regular (while not rigid) schedule and limit distractions. Establish a system of rewards and consequences to address the teen's behavior. Boost the teen's self-esteem by acknowledging success and positive behavioral choices. Create a home system to help the teen stay on schedule for both immediate- and more long-term academic projects. Establish a positive relationship with teachers so that regular, timely, bidirectional feedback occurs on a regular basis. Try to stay calm during the inevitable disagreements between you and your adolescent. Seek professional help if conflicts seem extreme. Encourage one hour of vigorous physical activity prior to starting homework. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated a positive relationship between vigorous physical activity and faster and more effective and accurate study habits. Establish regular, quality sleep patterns. Set firm, fair, consistent rules for the use of TV, computers, Internet, texting, cell phone usage, and video games. Find activities in which the child can be successful (for example, sports, hobbies, etc.)."
What stimulant medications are available to treat ADHD in teens?,"'Several studies have clearly established that pharmacologic (drug) therapy for ADHD is superior to behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. Combining medication and behavioral therapy is less likely to improve behavioral outcomes over medication alone unless patients are also experiencing ''anxiety'' or oppositional defiant disorder. The first category of therapeutic medications is chemically classified as ""''stimulants''."" Studies have established that 80% of patients with ADHD will have a positive response to their use and this therapy is generally well tolerated. Medications come in short- (three to four hour), medium- (five to six hour), and long-lasting (eight to 14 hour) formulations. The two most common medications are''Stimulant medications that are in liquid (Quillivant-XR and Dyanavel) or in patch form (''Daytrana'') are now available, allowing children who have ''difficulty swallowing'' pills to benefit from medication. Both the methylphenidate and amphetamine classes of stimulants are felt to positively affect the neurochemical transmitters of the brain that moderate attention, arousal, and impulse control.'  methylphenidate (for example, Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin, Metadate) and amphetamine (for example, Adderall, Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Mydayis)."
What are the potential side effects of stimulant medications for teens with ADHD?,"'Side effects may include appetite suppression, irritability, inhibited personality, ''depression'', and ''sleep'' issues. Rarely, patients may develop tics and very rarely patients develop ''hallucinations'' while taking stimulant medications. Studies show that short-term use of stimulants (up to three years) may contribute to a mild slowing of the rate of height acquisition; however, the ultimate acquired height when considering long-term use is not thought to be affected. Recently, there have been concerns regarding the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients treated with stimulants. A recent policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that several elements be evaluated prior to initiating therapy with stimulant medications.''A growing concern in high school and college involves students selling their stimulant medication to non-ADHD peers. These students harbor the false belief that taking such medication will boost their study skills and thus boost their academic performance.' Patient and family cardiac history of structural or functional heart disease, sudden death, unexplained death in children through young adults, and history of hereditary heart disease (cardiomyopathy and/or long QT syndrome): Concerns of these issues warrant evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. Routine EKG or echocardiogram studies are not thought to be necessary for most patients."
What non-stimulant medications are available to treat ADHD in teens?,"'Non-stimulant medications are generally considered to be second line in the treatment of ADHD. They are generally found to be more subtle in their effectiveness compared to stimulant-class medications. One of the primary non-stimulant medications prescribed is ''atomoxetine'' (''Strattera''). Other non-stimulant medications that have been found to be helpful in treating ADHD include those that are also used as cardiac medications like ''guanfacine'' (''Tenex'' or ''Intuniv'') and ''clonidine'' (''Kapvay'').''A disadvantage to such medications is that they may take up to six weeks for atomoxetine and one to four weeks for guanfacine and clonidine to achieve an effective dosage. As a consequence, taking ""drug holidays"" (for example, winter break) is not as feasible as it is when a patient is utilizing a member of the stimulant class of medications. Side effects of atomoxetine may include ''decreased appetite'', ''upset stomach'', and sleepiness. Side effects of guanfacine and clonidine may include sleepiness, ''dizziness'', ''low blood pressure'' when taking the medication, and ''high blood pressure'' if the medication is stopped abruptly. In 2005, the FDA published a ""black box"" warning for atomoxetine and the risk for ''suicidal thoughts'' or attempts, especially in adolescents.''Pediatric behavior specialists may consider the use of ''antidepressants'' for ADHD patients who experience unreasonable side effects, do not effectively respond to stimulant/non-stimulant medications, or in those who also suffer from significant ''depression'' or anxiety.' "
What alternative treatments are available for ADHD in teens?,"'Parents and patients often question the value of ""alternative"" (nondrug or non-''psychotherapy'') treatments to manage ADHD symptoms. A recent review has drawn the following conclusions:' There is currently no proof that a diet high in sugar contributes to ADHD behaviors. The Feingold diet attempts to eliminate artificial colorings, flavorings, and preservatives in an attempt to affect hyperactivity. No documented benefit has been demonstrated in quality studies and inflicting restrictive food choices on children and adolescents can prove to be problematic and cause unnecessary conflicts. Interactive metronome training trains the patient to mimic foot and hand tapping synchronized with a metronome. The theory is that ADHD symptoms are deficits in motor planning and that interactive metronome therapy promotes the ability to focus for extended periods of time, filter out distractions, and develop self-management of ADHD symptoms. A few studies have shown a positive benefit for this program in boys between 6-12 years of age in terms of visual motor control and less so with sustained attention or hyperactivity. Further research in this field is ongoing. Some chiropractors propose that muscle tone imbalances are causative for ADHD behaviors and that spinal adjustments are beneficial. To date, no scientifically rigorous study has confirmed this belief. Studies have shown that some patients with ADHD have a unique pattern of brain waves when studied by EEG. Neurofeedback techniques propose that a patient may be trained to eliminate these abnormal EEG patterns and thus modify their behaviors. While there are some promising results, concern regarding the high cost and duration of therapy exist. Several recent studies have explored the possible beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (for example, Vayarin). Some results indicate that there may be a small subset of patients with ADHD that may experience an improvement in symptoms of inattention. Studies are now ongoing to confirm this observation and attempt to predictably determine those individuals who may benefit from such supplements. Other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches have been tried but have not scientifically been demonstrated as helpful. These include megavitamin therapy, herbal and medicinal supplements (for example, St. John's wort), neurofeedback/biofeedback, and chelation therapy. Several studies involving St. John's wort and chelation therapy have been demonstrated to risk major side effects."
What is a newborn infant hearing screening program?,"'Newborn'' infant ''hearing'' screening programs are designed to identify ''hearing loss'' in infants shortly after birth. All states have implemented these screening protocols within hospitals and birthing clinics. Most hearing screening tests are done prior to discharge from the hospital or birthing clinics.''Typically, nurses or medical assistants are trained extensively on how to operate automated equipment for testing infants. Prior to discharge, each newborn has his/her hearing tested. If, for some reason, the newborn does not pass the screen, a rescreen is usually done. If the infant does not pass the second hearing test, he/she is referred to a specialist for further testing.'""Specialists who are experts at testing hearing are called audiologists. Audiologists have had training that emphasizes diagnostic hearing testing techniques as well as hearing rehabilitation of children and adults. Their postgraduate academic training requires a minimum of a master's degree."" "
Why is it important to screen for hearing loss in all newborn infants?,"'Significant ''hearing loss'' is the most common disorder at birth.  Approximately 1%-2% of newborns are affected.''Several national committees, including the National Institutes of Health, the American Academy of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', have recommended that hearing loss in infants be identified, and when possible treated, prior to 6 months of age. This recommendation is based on studies that have shown that children identified with hearing loss prior to 6 months of age have a better chance of developing skills equivalent to their peers by the time they enter kindergarten. Children not identified until later (for example, it is very common to first identify hearing impaired children at age 2 to 3 years) may ultimately suffer from irreversible and permanent impairments in speech, language, and cognitive abilities when compared to their peers.''Prior to the implementation of hearing screen programs, it was customary to only test those newborns who had known significant risk factors for hearing loss. This group included infants whose mothers suffered from illness during ''pregnancy'', those who had a family history of hearing loss, or those who were exposed to ''drugs'' known to affect hearing. In addition, infants with the following conditions were included for hearing screening:''However, despite the testing of all infants who fell into this ""high-risk registry,"" over half of all newborns with hearing loss were missed!'""In order to identify this large group of hearing-impaired infants not identified with current testing protocols, it is now recommended that all newborns have a hearing test prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of this program is to identify all hearing-impaired infants at an early age, thereby increasing these children's chance at healthy and more productive lives.""   low birth weight and/or prematurity, or oxygen deprivation or breathing difficulties at birth; high bilirubin levels (yellow color); syndromes associated with hearing loss; abnormal head or face structures; infections such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis, herpes, or toxoplasmosis; or low Apgar scores (which assess several health factors at one and again at five minutes after birth)."
How common is hearing loss in infants?,"'Most permanent hearing loss is due to damage/malfunction of the nerve that transmits sound from the inner ear to the brain (auditory nerve).  For those infants in whom a cause is determined, approximately half have a genetic condition and the remaining half have an acquired condition to explain their hearing loss.' "
What are some of the causes of hearing loss in the newborn?,"'Hearing loss in a newborn can be caused by a number of conditions. Some of the known risk factors include high bilirubin levels (''jaundice''), drugs that are toxic to the ears (for example, medicines that are given to the newborn to battle a serious infection may damage hearing as a side effect), prolonged mechanical ventilation, low Apgar scores, meningitis, prematurity, and/or low birth weight. Malformed structures in the middle or ''outer ear'' can also lead to hearing loss. Viral illness during the pregnancy, such as ''rubella'' (''German measles'') or ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), can be passed to the newborn and result in hearing loss. Hearing loss can sometimes be ''inherited'' in abnormal genes passed from the parents to the newborn or be the result of a gene mutation that occurred during ''fetal development''. ''Genetic counseling'' is often recommended for parents to determine if heredity is the cause of the hearing loss. In approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, the cause is never determined.' "
How is hearing in infants tested?,"""Hearing in infants can be tested using two different methods: the auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluations or the otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures. Both tests are accurate, noninvasive, automated, and do not require any observable response from the infant. Which test is used depends on the screening program's choice of instrumentation and training. For a screening tool, both methods are extremely effective. There are, however, some distinct differences in how the hearing is measured using an ABR versus an OAE."" "
What is an ABR test?,"'In order to process sounds, electrical impulses are transmitted through nerves from our ears to the brainstem at the base of the brain. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a physiological measure of the brainstem\'s response to sound. It tests the integrity of the hearing system from the ear to the brainstem. The test is performed by placing four to five electrodes on the infant\'s head, after which a variety of sounds is presented to the infant through small earphones. As the hearing nerve fires, the sound stimulus travels up to the brain. This electrical activity generated by the nerve can be recorded by the electrodes and is represented as waveforms on a computer screen. The audiologist can then present different loudness levels of each sound and determine the softest levels at which the infant can hear. For infant-screening purposes, only one sound is used to test the hearing, commonly referred to as a ""click."" The click is a grouping of several sounds to test a wider area of the hearing organ at one time. The click is typically presented at a loud level and a soft one. If a healthy response is recorded, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen. Testing usually takes five to 15 minutes to complete.' "
What is an OAE evaluation?,"'An otoacoustic emission test (OAE) measures an acoustic response that is produced by the inner ear (cochlea), which in essence bounces back out of the ear in response to a sound stimulus. The test is performed by placing a small probe that contains a microphone and speaker into the infant\'s ear. As the infant rests quietly, sounds are generated in the probe. Once the cochlea processes the sound, an electrical stimulus is sent to the brainstem. In addition, there is a second and separate sound that does not travel up the nerve but comes back out into the infant\'s ear canal. This ""byproduct"" is the otoacoustic emission. The emission is then recorded with the microphone probe and represented pictorially on a computer screen. The audiologist can determine which sounds yielded a response/emission and the strength of those responses. If there is an emission present for those sounds that are critical to speech comprehension, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen.  Testing generally takes about five to eight minutes.' "
"OAEs and ABRs, is one test better than the other?","""Both tests have advantages and disadvantages when used for screening, and depending on the program and experience of the audiologist, either one can be utilized successfully. The OAE is easy and cost-effective. However, the false-positive rate (for example, an infant fails a hearing test but actually has normal hearing) may be higher for an OAE than for an ABR. The false-positive rate for ABR testing is approximately 4% when testing is done during the first three days of life.  The false positive rate for OAE testing is 5%-21% for testing done during the first three days of life.  This large variation between ABR and OAE testing is commonly felt to reflect the OAE testing device's increased sensitivity to residual ""'amniotic fluid'"" and vernix that is commonly found in the neonate's ear canal.""'The two tests, however, rely on different mechanisms of hearing for the screening. For in-depth testing and a complete hearing evaluation of infants, these tests work best together as a complement to each other.' "
What does it mean when an infant does not pass the hearing screen?,"'A newborn who fails an initial hearing screen may not necessarily have a permanent hearing loss or a hearing loss at all. There are many possible reasons why an infant may fail a hearing screening test. One common reason is that fluid from the birth may still be present in the ear canal. This fluid blocks the sound stimulus, preventing it from reaching the inner ear, and therefore causes the newborn to fail. Similarly, fluid in the middle-ear space behind the eardrum (a common site for infection in children) can also block the sound stimulus and lead to a false failed test. After these problems resolve, the infant usually passes the rescreen. Therefore, it is important to have at least one week between the initial hearing screen and the rescreen to allow the newborn a chance to ""dry out.""''Another possible reason for a false failure is excessive noise or movement from the infant during the test. The responses that are recorded with an ABR or OAE are very, very small. Any movement or crying from the infant can prevent the equipment from detecting the response. Therefore, it is important that the newborn is quiet or sleeping for the hearing screen. Feeding the infant just prior to the screening is often very helpful. Although neither test is painful, they are novel experiences for the newborn and can be momentarily upsetting.''If it becomes evident that an infant has a hearing loss, then a full diagnostic exam is necessary to determine the type and amount of hearing loss.' "
What is the difference between a hearing screen and a diagnostic hearing test?,"'The basic difference between a diagnostic test and a hearing screen is the amount of information gathered during the session. For example, if an infant fails the hearing screen, it is unknown if there truly is a hearing loss, how much hearing loss is present, or whether or not the hearing loss is permanent or correctable. A diagnostic test can usually answer these questions. The diagnostic test session is understandably longer and requires more interaction with the infant. Typically, a more extensive ABR is conducted, using a variety of test stimuli. OAEs are also performed to cross-check the results of the ABR. To complete a thorough test, the infant needs to ''sleep'' in the office for upward of 45 minutes. The more information that can be collected, the more complete the results will be.' "
"If an infant does not pass a hearing screen in the hospital, what happens next?","'Most hospital screening programs will refer infants who failed the initial screening test to a secondary center that specializes in more complete testing for diagnosis. Sometimes, simple problems, such as too much  residual amniotic fluid and vernix in the ear canal, will resolve prior to the rescreen and the infant will pass the second test. The rescreen is an important step in determining whether the infant is able to hear, so it should not be taken lightly.''If an infant does not pass the rescreen, then a full diagnostic test will be necessary. This test may be completed at the rescreen site or at another facility, depending on several factors.' "
"If an infant has a hearing loss, what is the next step?","'The ability of an infant to compensate for the hearing loss will depend on both the type and the degree of hearing loss.''The type of hearing loss refers to where in the ear the hearing loss is located and what is causing it. There are two basic types of hearing loss, conductive and sensorineural. A conductive loss is caused by problems in the outer or middle ear. This is the type of loss that results when a child has a middle-''ear infection'', trapped fluid from birth, impacted wax in the outer ear or malformation of the ear and associated structures. It is usually correctable with medical treatment or surgery. Occasionally, a conductive loss cannot be corrected with surgery. However, these children typically do extremely well with hearing aids. A sensorineural loss is indicative of a problem in the inner ear or somewhere along the nerve to the ear (auditory nerve). This type of loss is typically permanent and cannot be corrected with surgery. A hearing aid or a cochlear implant may be utilized in this situation.''The degree of hearing loss refers to the severity of the hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound. Although the term ""mild"" sounds relatively benign, a mild hearing loss in a child who is trying to develop speech and language can have a huge impact on his/her success.'""If the hearing loss, whether it is conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both, is determined to be uncorrectable by a physician, then the next step is to fit the infant with hearing aids. This is accomplished by a pediatric audiologist who can adjust the hearing aids according to the baby's hearing loss and monitor the infant's progress through regular visits. The infant should also be enrolled in an early childhood intervention program that is often provided through the school system.""""In addition to the early medical or surgical treatment of the hearing loss, parental involvement is essential. Parents need to monitor the child's progress and facilitate and encourage the use of the hearing aids and other therapeutic exercises that are designed to help the child become a careful listener and talker. Research has found that the one common denominator among successful hearing-impaired children is the parent's willingness to help the child throughout his/her lifetime.""'Summary & Recommendations (from the American Academy of Pediatrics Preventative Series Task Force -- July 2008)''Importance: Children with hearing loss have increased difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication skills, increased behavioral problems, decreased psychosocial well-being, and lower educational attainment compared with children with normal hearing.''Detection: Because half of the children with hearing loss have no identifiable risk factors, universal screening (instead of targeted screening) has been proposed to detect children with permanent congenital hearing loss.  There is good evidence that newborn hearing screening testing is highly accurate and leads to earlier identification and treatment of infants with hearing loss.''Benefits of detection and early treatment: Good quality evidence shows that early detection improves lingual outcomes.' "
What is central auditory processing disorder (CAPD)?,"'Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) (also known as Auditory Processing Disorder and Receptive Language Disorder), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that result in a breakdown in the hearing process. In short, our brain cannot make sense of what our ears hear because the auditory signal is distorted in some way. As a result, one of the biggest problems experienced by individuals with CAPD is difficulty listening in background noise.''Children need to understand spoken language before they can use language to express themselves. In most cases, children with a receptive language problem also have an expressive language disorder, which means they have trouble using spoken language.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of auditory processing disorder?,"'The symptoms and signs or receptive language disorder vary from child to child since there is no standard set of symptoms that indicates receptive language disorder. However, symptoms may include:'  Not seeming to listen when you speak to them Appearing to lack interest when storybooks are read to them Difficulty understanding the meaning of words and sentences Difficulty remembering all the words in a sentence in order to make sense of what has been said Inability to understand complicated sentences Inability to follow verbal instructions; especially if the instruction is long or complicated."
What causes auditory processing disorder?,"'The cause of receptive language disorder is often unknown, but is thought to consist of a number of factors working in combination, such as:''In other cases, receptive language disorder is caused by damage to the brain, for example due to trauma, tumors, or disease.''Receptive language disorder may also be related to:'  Genetic susceptibility (family history of receptive language disorder) Limited exposure to hearing language in their day-to-day environment General developmental and cognitive (thinking) diabilities. Receptive language disorder is often associated with developmental disorders such as autism or Down syndrome. (Although for some children, difficulty with language is the only developmental problem they experience.) Hearing impairment: due to decreased exposure to language Vision impairment: due to the absence of cues such as facial expression and gestures Attention disorders: due to difficulties in attending fully to what is being said."
How common is audio processing disorder?,"'It is estimated that between three and five per cent of children have a receptive or expressive language disorder, or a mixture of both. Another name for receptive language disorder is language comprehension deficit. Speech-language therapy is used to treat receptive language disorder.' "
How is auditory processing disorder diagnosed in children?,"'Assessment needs to pinpoint the child’s particular areas of difficulty, especially when they do not respond to spoken language. Diagnosis may include:' Hearing tests (by an audiologist) to check whether the language problems are caused by hearing impairment and to establish whether or not the child is able to pay attention to sound and language (auditory processing assessment) Testing the child’s language comprehension (by a speech pathologist) and comparing the results to the expected skill level for the child’s age. If the child is from a non-English speaking home, assessment of comprehension should be performed in their first language, as well as in English, using culturally-appropriate materials Close observation of the child in a variety of different settings while they interact with a range of people Assessment by a psychologist to help identify any associated cognitive problems Vision tests to check for vision impairment."
What are the treatments auditory processing disorder?,"'Treatment options for receptive language disorder may include:'""A child's progress will depend on a range of individual factors, such as whether or not ""'brain injury'' is present.'  Speech-language therapy (one-on-one or as part of a group, or both, depending on the needs of the child) Providing information to families so that they can facilitate language growth at home Special education classes at school Integration support at preschool or school in cases of severe difficulty Referral to a psychologist for treatment (only if there are also significant behavioral problems)."
What is expressive language disorder? What are the symptoms and signs?,"'A child with receptive language disorder may also have expressive language disorder, which means they have difficulties with using spoken language. Symptoms differ from one child to the next, but can include:' Frequently grasping for the right word Using the wrong words in speech Making grammatical mistakes Relying on short, simple sentence construction Relying on stock standard phrases Inability to 'come to the point' of what they’re trying to say Problems with retelling a story or relaying information Inability to start or hold a conversation."

Plumping your pucker often improves self-confidence and sexual confidence.""'The good news is that you have many options to improve the appearance of your lips. The methods we discuss here also reduce fine lines and ''wrinkles'"" around your lips. It's important to be realistic, too. Injections or implants can enhance and improve your natural look, but they're not about performing miracles. "" "
Who Are the Best Candidates for Lip Augmentation?,"'You must be in good general health overall. You are not a good candidate for lip augmentation if you have: ''Like any other ''cosmetic surgery'"", lip augmentation requires a lot of responsibility. You can only determine for yourself if you're ready. We've included the most popular injections and implants here. This information should serve as a general overview only and should not replace your doctor's advice. Once you've selected a doctor, you will communicate with him or her and decide together which option best suits your needs. ""' As with any medical procedure, you should tell your doctor of any ''allergies'' or any medications that you are taking and you will be required to discuss your medical history. Certain diseases such as ''diabetes'' can increase your chances of complications. If you are a smoker, this may also be a complicating factor.' Current cold sores Certain diseases such as diabetes or lupus Any scarring of the lips  Blood clotting problems"
Injections for Lip Augmentation,"""Your surgeon will most likely use topical anesthesia (painkiller applied directly to the lips) for injections. These are performed on an outpatient basis in your doctor's office or an outpatient center and you will be sent home the same day.""' Here are the options: ' Artecoll is a synthetic material that plumps up the lips. Because it's synthetic, you are at higher risk of having an allergic reaction to it than if you got an injection of collagen or fat, but it lasts longer than either. Autologen is an injection of your own collagen, extracted from another place on your body. There's no risk of allergic reaction, however, the results are only temporary. This may be good for people who aren't ready to commit to a permanent result. Collagen can be extracted from cows and injected into the lips. There's a risk of allergic reaction, so it's best to have your surgeon give you a test dose before proceeding to the full dose. The results are temporary lasting 
	four weeks to three months. Dermalogen is collagen extracted from deceased human donors. This is also a temporary fix, but your body should not reject it. Fascia injections use a specific type of connective tissue harvested either from your own body or from a deceased human donor. It can be implanted surgically or injected. The main drawback is that within a year of injection, your body will reabsorb the fascia. Fat from your own thighs or abdomen can be injected into your lips. There's no risk of allergic reaction and you may achieve permanent results. This can also be implanted surgically (see below). If you gain weight, your lips may enlarge since the fat cells will get bigger.  Hylaform is a material created from a natural body substances known as hyaluronic acid. There's no risk of infection, but you will need repeated treatments to maintain the result as it's only a temporary fix. Restylane is a clear gel. It contains hyaluronic acid. It's biodegradable, so your body will absorb it within about six months of the injection. "
Lip Implants and Surgeries,"""You will most likely receive local anesthesia if you get a lip implant or have lip augmentation surgery. A procedure can take up to two hours at your doctor's office or outpatient center, depending on the complexity, and you will be sent home the same day.""'Here are the options:''Your surgeon may also be able to make an incision along the upper line of your lip.' Alloderm is a sheet of collagen created from deceased humans. Your surgeon inserts them through tiny incisions made on the inside part of the lip. This material offers only a temporary fix, lasting up to 12 months. Fat grafting is the surgical method of inserting your own fat into your lips to achieve the desired fullness. You may achieve permanent results, but this method varies from person to person. Because it's your own fat, there is a chance that your body can reabsorb it. Goretex, SoftForm, and soft ePTFE are synthetic materials that can achieve a permanent result. Unlike some of the other options we've listed above, your body will not absorb these. However, because they are synthetic, there is a risk of allergic reaction. Local flap grafts is a 
  surgical procedure that takes tissue and skin from the inside flap of your 
  mouth. It's far more invasive than any other technique, and is often the last resort among plastic surgeons."
How Long Will Recovery Take After Lip Augmentation?,"""It's important that you have someone with you who can drive you home after a lip augmentation procedure.""'If you are having surgical implants or grafts, your recovery can take up to two weeks after the surgery.'""It's important that you know yourself. Discuss how much time you think you'll need for recovery with your doctor. It may be necessary to take some time off work. You will need at least three days off from work, at minimum.

What is autism?,"'\tAutism is a developmental disorder that is characterized by impaired development in communication, social interaction, and behavior. It affects the lives of many children and their families. It tends to affect more boys than girls.''\tIn the past, autism has been confused with childhood ''schizophrenia'' or childhood psychosis, and may have been misunderstood as ''schizotypal personality disorder'' in some adults. As additional research information about autism becomes available, the scope and definition of the condition continues to become more refined. Some of the past ''confusion'' about the disorder has been resolved.'  "
What are early signs and symptoms of autism in children and adults?,"'The current ''Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', fifth edition (DSM-V) identifies two features that are associated with autism:'   impairment in social interaction and communication, and behavior."
What are the different types of autism?,"""The group of disorders that formerly included autism, pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Asperger's syndrome, and sometimes Rett's disorder and childhood integrative disorder are now referred to as autism spectrum disorders. The range of these disorders varies from severely impaired individuals that were formerly described as suffering from autism to other, more high-functioning individuals who have abnormalities of social interaction but normal intelligence, who were described as having Asperger's syndrome. The ways in which autism spectrum disorders are exhibited can differ greatly. Additionally, autism can be found in association with other disorders such as mental retardation and certain medical conditions. The degree of autism can range from mild to severe. Mildly affected individuals may appear very close to normal. Severely afflicted individuals may have an extreme intellectual disability and be unable to function in almost any setting.""  "
What causes autism?,"'\tSince autism was first added to the psychiatric literature about 50 years ago, there have been numerous studies and theories about its causes. Researchers still have not reached agreement regarding its specific causes. First, it must be recognized that autism is a set of a wide variety of symptoms and may have many causes. This concept is not unusual in medicine. For instance, the set of symptoms that we perceive of as a ""''cold''"" can be caused by literally hundreds of different ''viruses'', bacteria, and even our own immune system.''\tAutism is thought to be a biologically-based disorder. In the past, some researchers had suggested that autism was the result of poor attachment skills on the part of the mother. This belief has caused a great deal of unnecessary ''pain'' and guilt on the part of the parents of children with autism, when in fact, the inability of the individual with autism to interact appropriately is one of the key symptoms of this developmental disorder. Some risk factors for autism include high maternal age at the time of birth of the child, as well as maternal ''prenatal'' medication use, bleeding, or ''gestational diabetes''. Other support of a biological theory of autism includes that several known neurological disorders are associated with autistic features. Autism is one of the symptoms of these disorders. These conditions include:''\tAutism, in short, seems to be the end result or ""final common pathway"" of numerous disorders that affect brain development. Also, brain studies have demonstrated that persons with autism tend to have a number of abnormalities in brain size. In general, however, when clinicians make the diagnosis of autism, they are excluding the known causes of autistic behaviors. However, as the knowledge of conditions that cause autism advances, fewer and fewer cases will likely be thought of as being ""pure"" autism and more individuals will be identified as having autism due to specific causes.''\tThere is a strong association between autism and ''seizures''. This association works in two ways: First, many patients with autism develop ''seizures''. Second, patients with seizures, which are probably due to other causes, may develop autistic-like behaviors. One special and often misunderstood association between autism and seizures is the ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome''. This syndrome is also known as acquired epileptic ''aphasia''. Some children with ''epilepsy'' develop a sudden loss of language skills -- especially receptive language (the ability to understand). Many often also develop the ''symptoms of autism''.''\tThese children often, but not always, have a characteristic pattern of electrical brain activity seen on ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') during deep ''sleep'' called electrographic status epilepticus during ''sleep'' (ESES). The usual age of onset of language loss or regression is around 4 years of age, which makes the Landau-Kleffner syndrome distinguishable from autism on these grounds, in that autism usually is first exhibited in younger children. However, in recent years, some children (very, very few) who did not exhibit overt (observable) seizures were found to have Landau-Kleffner syndrome.''\tThe importance of these findings is that, although rare, the Landau-Kleffner syndrome can resolve spontaneously and in some cases can be treatable with ''prednisone'', a steroid medication related to cortisone. This association between the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and autism has led many clinicians and families to search for the typical EEG pattern (ESES) in individuals with autism. This unusual EEG pattern is seen only in deep sleep, which usually requires prolonged recordings of up to 12 hours. Many, many children and adults with this disorder will display some abnormalities on their sleep EEG, but probably very few have true Landau-Kleffner syndrome that will respond to treatment.''\tIt must also be noted that prednisone, in the very high doses used to treat Landau-Kleffner syndrome, almost invariably produces side effects, which may include ''weight gain'', ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', growth failure, stomach ulcers, irritability, ''mood swings'', ''hyperactivity'', destruction of the hip joint, and susceptibility to infectious disease (suppressed immune system). While most of these side effects are reversible, some of the complications of high-dose prednisone therapy can be irreversible and even fatal.''\tOther treatments ranging from common anticonvulsant therapy to surgery have been proposed and are being tried for Landau-Kleffner syndrome. It is difficult to evaluate the true effects of any treatment for Landau-Kleffner syndrome due to the high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms (remission).'

		cerebral dysgenesis (abnormal development of the brain); 
		Rett syndrome (a mutation of a single gene); and 
		some of the inborn errors of metabolism (biochemical defects)."
Is autism genetic?,"'Because many different disorders can result in autism, this question is complex. Certainly, disorders such as the fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, which are both associated with autism, are inherited. There are many families with more than one child with autism where the autism is not clearly due to another cause. Recent studies have found that the gene for at least one kind of familial autism may be on chromosome 13. In some families, autism seems to be passed from generation to generation. In other families, autism is not found in prior generations, but affects multiple siblings (brothers or sisters). The results of this research make it likely that at least one ""autism gene"" will eventually be found. ''However, the majority of individuals with autism do NOT have a strong family history, which supports the premise that environmental or a combination of environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of autism. In this context, environmental is meant to indicate any nongenetic factor, including infections, toxins, ''nutrition'', or others.' "
Impairment of social interaction and communication,"'Individuals with autism fail to develop normal personal interactions in virtually every setting. This means that affected persons fail to form the normal social contacts that are such an important part of human development. This impairment may be so severe that it even affects the bonding between a mother and an infant. It is important to note that, contrary to popular belief, many, if not most, persons with this disorder are capable of showing affection, demonstrating affection bonding with their mothers or other caregivers. However, the ways in which individuals with autism demonstrate affection and bonding may differ greatly from the ways in which others do so. Their limited socialization may erroneously lead family members and health professionals away from considering the diagnosis of autism.''As the child develops, interaction with others continues to be abnormal. Affected behaviors can include eye contact, facial expressions, and body postures. There is usually an inability to develop normal peer and sibling relationships and the child often seems isolated. There may be little or no joy or interest in normal age-appropriate activities. Affected children or adults do not seek out peers for play or other social interactions. In severe cases, they may not even be aware of the presence of other individuals.''Communication is usually severely impaired in persons with autism. What the individual understands (receptive language) as well as what is actually spoken by the individual (expressive language) are significantly delayed or nonexistent. Deficits in language comprehension include the inability to understand simple directions, questions, or commands. Persons with a high-functioning autism spectrum disorder might understand simple speech but still have difficulty interpreting the more subtle meaning in conversation. There may be an absence of dramatic or pretend play and these children may not be able to engage in simple age-appropriate childhood games such as Simon Says or Hide-and-Go-Seek. ''Teens'' and adults with autism may continue to engage in playing with games that are for young children and may seek to establish friendships with people much younger than them.''Individuals with autism who do speak may be unable to initiate or participate in a two-way conversation (reciprocal). Frequently the way in which a person with this disorder speaks is perceived as unusual. Their speech may seem to lack the normal emotion and sound flat or monotonous. The sentences are often very immature: ""want water"" instead of ""I want some water, please."" Those with autism often repeat words or phrases that are spoken to them. For example, you might say, ""Look at the airplane!"" and the child or adult may respond ""at airplane,"" without any knowledge of what was said. This repetition is known as ''echolalia''. Memorization and recitation of songs, stories, commercials, or even entire scripts is not uncommon. While many feel this is a sign of intelligence, the autistic person usually does not appear to understand any of the content in his or her speech. ' "
Behaviors,"'\tPersons with autism often exhibit a variety of abnormal behaviors. There may be repetitive actions, a hypersensitivity to sensory input through vision, ''hearing'', or touch (tactile). As a result, there may be an extreme intolerance to loud noises or crowds, visual stimulation, or things that are felt. Birthday parties and other celebrations can be disastrous for some of these individuals. Wearing socks or tags on clothing may be perceived as painful. Sticky fingers, playing with modeling clay, eating birthday cake or other foods, or ''walking'' barefoot across the grass can be unbearable. On the other hand, there may be an underdeveloped (hyposensitivity) response to the same type of stimulation. This individual may use abnormal means to experience visual, auditory, or tactile (touch) input. This person may head bang, scratch until blood is drawn, scream instead of speaking in a normal tone, or bring everything into close visual range. He or she might also touch an object, image, or other people thoroughly just to experience the sensory input.''\tChildren and adults who have autism are often tied to routine and many everyday tasks may be ritualistic. Something as simple as a bath might only be accomplished after the precise amount of water is in the tub, the temperature is exact, the same soap is in its assigned spot, and even the same towel is in the same place. Any break in the routine can provoke a severe reaction in the individual and place a tremendous strain on the adult trying to work with him or her.''\tThere may also be nonpurposeful repetition of actions or behaviors. Persistent rocking, ''teeth grinding'', hair or finger twirling, hand flapping, and walking on tiptoe are not uncommon. Frequently, there is a preoccupation with a very limited interest or a specific plaything. A child or adult may continually play with only one type of toy. The child may line up all the dolls or cars and the adult line up their clothes or toiletries, for example, and repeatedly and systematically perform the same action on each one. Any attempt to disrupt the person may result in extreme reactions on the part of the individual with autism, including tantrums or direct physical attack. Objects that spin, open and close, or perform some other action can hold an extreme fascination. If left alone, a person with this disorder may sit for hours turning off and on a light switch, twirling a spinning toy, or stacking nesting objects. Some individuals can also have an inappropriate bonding to specific objects and become hysterical without that piece of string, paper clip, or wad of paper.' "
How is autism diagnosed in children and adults?,"'The essential features of autism are the significantly impaired or abnormal development of communication and social interaction and the abnormally restricted repertoire of behaviors, activities, and interests. This disturbance in normal development must manifest itself by the time the child is a toddler, prior to age 3. While many parents report normal development in the first year of the child, there is actually limited opportunity to observe this, as the child is often not brought to the attention of a practitioner who has specific experience in diagnosing autism until several years later in many cases. If there is a period of normal development, it cannot extend past age 3. As the early onset of the disorder is a key component in its diagnosis, it is important that practitioners screen for the possible presence of autism in all children from infancy on. As identifying autism as early as possible allows more timely and, therefore, more effective treatment, professionals tend to screen infants and toddlers using a variety of questionnaires, tests, and checklists. Examples of such screening tools include the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Screening Test, Second Edition, and the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds.''Any person with a delay or regression (loss) of language or an abnormality of social interaction beginning prior to the age of 3 may be suspected of being autistic. The medical evaluation begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination. This examination should be performed by a health care professional not only familiar with autism, but with other disorders that may appear similar to or mimic the symptoms of autism. The health care professional should have particular expertise in the neurological examination of impaired individuals or recommend consultation with such a professional, as subtle findings may lead the examiner down a particular diagnostic path. For example, the presence of mild ''weakness'' or increased reflexes on one side of the body will lead the examiner to conclude that a structural abnormality in the brain is present and that an ''MRI'' examination of the brain is appropriate.''The history and physical examination will point the examiner to specific diagnostic testing to evaluate for other conditions associated with autism or developmental delay. Any child who has a language delay should have his or her hearing formally evaluated. For example, it is not sufficient to simply determine whether or not a person being examined is able to hear. In order for normal language development to proceed, the individual must have sufficient hearing capabilities at low volumes in the high frequency range. Therefore, even if the person turns his or her head to a clap or shout, he or she may still have enough of a hearing deficit to inhibit language development.''There are two types of hearing tests; 1) behavioral audiometry; and 2) brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER).''If he or she is capable, behavioral audiometry is the preferred method primarily because sedation is not required. Depending upon specific features of the examination and history, the practitioner may want to obtain blood and urine samples for specialized testing to evaluate for some of the inborn errors of metabolism and to obtain DNA for chromosomal studies and fragile X testing.''If the neurological examination is normal, there may be no need for a brain ''CT scan'' or MRI scan. However, if the neurological examination is suggestive of a structural brain lesion, then a neuroimaging study, preferably an MRI, should be performed. Newer imaging procedures such as SPECT or PET scans are used primarily as research tools and have no place in the initial evaluation of the autistic individual. In very specialized instances, such as the autistic person with difficult-to-control seizures, such tests may be useful.''The evaluation of individuals with autism by speech pathologists will provide not only detailed information as to the nature of the language deficits incurred by the afflicted individual, but will also be the first step in formulating a specific treatment plan with respect to language. Occupational assessment may be particularly helpful in determining the day-to-day strengths and vulnerabilities of the individual with autism (for example, sensitivity to clothing and food texture) and assist those who care for the person in promoting his or her strengths and compensating for their challenges.''Given the complex and far-reaching symptoms and effects of autism, it is generally thought that the most accurate and thorough diagnosis of this disorder is obtained by a group of health care professionals from various disciplines, also called a multidisciplinary team, that includes a pediatrician, speech and occupational therapists, educators, and often psychiatrists and others.' Behavioral audiometry is performed by a skilled clinical audiologist. The person being examined is placed in a room and his or her responses to different tones are observed. For the brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) test, the individual is sedated and earphones are placed over the ears. Tones of different volumes and frequencies are played and the electrical response of the brain is monitored."
How is autism treated in children and adults?,'Misinformation about autism is very common. Claims of a cure for autism are constantly presented to families of individuals with autism. There are various treatment models found within both the educational and clinical settings. ' 
What common sociobehavioral interventions are used to treat autism?,"""There is only one treatment approach that has prevailed over time and is effective for all persons, with or without autism. That treatment model is an educational (school or vocational) program that is suitable to a student's developmental level of performance. One such program is the Son-Rise Program. For adults, that treatment model refers to a vocational program that is suitable to the individual's developmental level of functioning.""'Under the federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA) Act of 1990, students with a handicap are guaranteed an ""appropriate education"" in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), which is generally considered to be as normal an educational setting as possible. As a result of this legislation, children with autism have often been placed in a mainstreamed classroom and pulled out for whatever supplementary services were needed. Depending on the child\'s needs, he or she could be placed up to 100% of the school day in a mainstreamed or a special education setting or any combination of the two in order to receive the most appropriate help possible.'""There is an increasing trend, however, in advocacy for children with autism, to segregate these children into small, highly structured and controlled academic and vocational training programs that are almost free from auditory and visual stimulation. All instruction is broken down into manageable segments. Information is presented in tiny units and the child's response is immediately sought. A classic stimulus-response approach is used to maximize learning. Each unit of information is mastered before another is presented. A fundamental behavior such as putting hands on the tabletop, for example, must be mastered before the child is required to perform any other tasks, or before more information is presented. The long-term effects of this type of treatment, as well as the ability of the child to transfer this to a broader context, continue to be evaluated. For people with autism whose symptoms include self injurious behaviors, the focus of treatment has shifted from restriction and punishment to more of a focus on understanding potential motivators for negative behaviors, as well as rewards and other encouragement and support for using appropriate behaviors.""'Children, teens, and adults with autism need to be taught how to communicate and interact with others. This is not a simple task, and it involves the entire family as well as other professionals. Parents of a child or adult with autism must continually educate themselves about new therapies and keep an open mind. Some treatments may be appropriate for some individuals but not for others. Many treatments have yet to be scientifically proven. Treatment decisions should always be made individually after a thorough assessment and based on what is suitable for that person and his or her family.''It is important to remember, despite some recent denials, that autism is usually a lifelong condition. The kind of support that is appropriate will change as the individual develops. Families must beware of treatment programs that give false hope of a cure. Acceptance of the condition in a family member is a very critical, foundational component of any treatment program and is understandably quite difficult.''Psychotherapeutic approaches that have been found to help improve functioning in some persons with autism include comprehensive behavioral therapy to address problematic behaviors. Social skills training and support are important in helping people with autism navigate interactions with others, since many of this population crave social interaction despite their limitations in engaging others socially. Cognitive behavioral treatment in verbal individuals with ''anxiety'' and voice output communication who are less verbal are considered promising areas of treatment as well.' "
Do vaccines play a role in autism?,"'Although some remain convinced that certain ''vaccines'', ''vaccine'' preservatives, or medications taken to treat side effects of ''vaccines'' may cause autism, conventional wisdom is supported by research that continues to consistently demonstrate that immunizations do not cause autism.'  "
What are the common medications used to treat the symptoms of autism? ,"'Several medications have been tried or are being evaluated for the treatment of autism. No medication has consistently proven to be of benefit for either curing or comprehensively managing autism in closely controlled ''clinical trials''. ''In the past, a piece on a television news show prompted a great deal of interest in the hormone secretin as a treatment for autism. A child with autism with chronic gastrointestinal complaints showed dramatic improvement following some routine testing performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' during which a small dose of secretin was administered. The family and their physicians felt that the secretin may have resulted in the improvement in the symptoms of autism. Many physicians began prescribing secretin, which can be expensive. However, studies published appear to completely refute the claim that secretin treatment benefits autistic patients. This example underscores the importance of good clinical trials to determine whether a drug will help patients with autism before it is widely used. ''Some medications have been found to help address some symptoms that may present in autism. For example, ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol'') and ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify'') are thought to help treat aggression and ''methylphenidate'' has been determined to be helpful in addressing hyperactivity and other ''symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') in persons with autism. ''Risperidone'' (''Risperdal'') has been found to be quite helpful in many people whose autistic symptoms include odd, repetitive behaviors (stereotypies), hyperactivity, irritability, throwing tantrums, being aggressive towards others, and of injuring oneself.' "
Can diet and supplements play a role in the treatment of autism?,"'A number of ''dietary supplements'' are often given to persons with autism. Examples of such interventions include ''omega-3 fatty acids''. While a significant percentage of people with autism are given dietary ''supplements'' as part of treatment, there is insufficient research to determine whether or not such interventions are helpful or harmful.'  "
How does autism impact the family?,"'Having a family member with autism presents emotional, social, and financial challenges. The ''stress'"" placed on parents and other family members of people with autism can be influenced by a number of factors. Examples of such factors include how well the person with autism functions, how much social support the family receives, and sometimes the ethnicity of the person's parents. Siblings of children and teens with autism seem to fare better in their understanding and acceptance of the family member with autism when provided with education about their loved one's condition.""  "
What is the prognosis for children and adults with autism?,"'Persons with autism seem to have a higher mortality rate at younger ages compared to average individuals. This is particularly true for mortality that is related to seizures or infection. It is, therefore, important for the autistic population to receive good medical care from health care professionals who have knowledge and experience in addressing their unique medical needs.''Due to a number of potential factors, autistic persons tend to be vulnerable to nutritional problems. Specifically, factors like variations in appetite, refusal of many foods, ''food allergies'"", and side effects to some medications can disproportionately impact the food intake, and therefore, the nutritional status of this population. Individuals with autism have been found to be vulnerable to respiratory problems as well, which results in this population having more doctors' visits than people who do not have autism. As people with autism also are vulnerable to emotional struggles like ""'anxiety'', ''depression'', and attention problems, the help of ''mental health'' professionals should be sought when appropriate.'

Autism screening and diagnosis overview,"'Diagnosing ''autism'"" spectrum disorders (ASDs) can be difficult, since there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorders. Doctors look at the child's behavior and development to make a diagnosis.""'ASDs can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger.  By age 2, a diagnosis by an experienced professional can be considered very reliable. However, many children do not receive a final diagnosis until much older.  This delay means that children with an ''ASD'' might not get the help they need.''Diagnosing an ''ASD'' takes two steps:' "
Developmental screening,"'Developmental screening'' is a short test to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have delays.  During ''developmental screening'' the doctor might ask the parent some questions or talk and play with the child during an exam to see how she learns, speaks, behaves, and moves.  A delay in any of these areas could be a sign of a problem.''All children should be screened for developmental delays and disabilities during regular well-child doctor visits at:''In addition, all children should be screened specifically for ASDs during regular well-child doctor visits at:''It is important for doctors to screen all children for developmental delays, but especially to monitor those who are at a higher risk for developmental problems due to preterm birth, low birth weight, or having a brother or sister with an ASD.'""If your child's doctor does not routinely check your child with this type of developmental screening test, ask that it be done.""'If the doctor sees any signs of a problem, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is needed. ' 9 months 18 months 24 or 30 months Additional screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for developmental problems due to preterm birth, low birth weight or other reasons. 18 months 24 months Additional screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASDs (e.g., having a sister, brother or other family member with an ASD) or if behaviors sometimes associated with ASDs are present"
Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation,"""The second step of diagnosis is a comprehensive evaluation.  This thorough review may include looking at the child's behavior and development and interviewing the parents.  It may also include a ""'hearing'' and vision screening, genetic testing, neurological testing, and other medical testing.''In some cases, the primary care doctor might choose to refer the child and family to a specialist for further assessment and diagnosis. Specialists who can do this type of evaluation include:' Developmental Pediatricians (doctors who have special training in child development and children with special needs) Child Neurologists (doctors who work on the brain, spine, and nerves) Child Psychologists or Psychiatrists (doctors who know about the human mind)"
Do vaccines cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)?,"'Many studies that have looked at whether there is a relationship between vaccines and ''autism'' spectrum disorders (ASDs). To date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with ASDs.''However, CDC knows that some parents and others still have concerns. To address these concerns, CDC is part of the Inter-Agency ''Autism'' Coordinating Committee (IACC), which is working with the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) on this issue. The job of the NVAC is to advise and make recommendations regarding the National Vaccine Program. Communication between the IACC and NVAC will allow each group to share skills and knowledge, improve coordination, and promote better use of research resources on vaccine topics.' "
Is there an ASD epidemic?,"'More people than ever before are being diagnosed with an ASD. It is unclear exactly how much of this increase is due to a broader definition of ASDs and better efforts in diagnosis. However, a true increase in the number of people with an ASD cannot be ruled out. We believe the increase in the diagnosis of ASDs is likely due to a combination of these factors.''CDC is working with partners to study the prevalence of ASDs over time, so that we can find out if the number of children with these disorders is rising, dropping, or staying the same.''We do know that ASDs are more common than we thought before and should be considered an urgent public health concern.''There is still a lot to learn about ASDs. In addition, increased concern in the communities, continued demand for services, and reports estimating a prevalence of about 1 percent show the need for a coordinated and serious national response to improve the lives of people with ASDs.' "
Can adults be diagnosed with an ASD?,"""Yes, adults can be diagnosed with an ASD. Diagnosis includes looking at the person's medical history, watching the person's behavior, and giving the person some psychological tests. But, it can be more challenging to diagnose an adult because it is not always possible to know about the person's development during the first few years of life, and a long history of other diagnoses may complicate an ASD diagnosis. Because the focus of ASDs has been on children, we still have much to learn about the prevalence and causes of ASDs across the lifespan. Behavioral interventions can be effective for adults coping with a new diagnosis of ""'autism''.' "
How many children with ASDs are being served through public special education programs?,"'In 2007, 258,305 children 6 through 21 years of age and 39,434 children 3 through 5 years of age were served under the ""autism"" classification for special education services. Not all children with an ASD receive special education services under the classification of ""autism,"" so the education data are not meant to represent the actual number of people with an ASD.' "
Has the number of children being served under an ASD classification in public special education programs changed?,"'Yes. between1998 to 2007, the number of 6 to 21 year old children receiving services for an ASD in public special education programs increased from 54,064 to 258,305. While it is clear that more children are getting special education services for ASDs than ever before, it is important to remember that this classification was only added in the early 1990s. Growth in the number of children classified may be caused in part by the addition of autism as a special education category.' "
How do the rates of ASDs in special education compare with those of other special education categories?,"'In 2007, according to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act administrative counts, 5,912,586 children 6 through 21 years of age received services through 13 categories in public special education programs. ""Specific ''learning disability''"" was the most frequent education category identified, followed by ""speech and language impairment."" Together, these two categories made up nearly 64% of all special education placements. The intellectual disability classification accounted for about 8% (487,854). Autism accounted for about 4% (256,863).'""CDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) found the autism rate among 8-year-old children in 2000 to be 6.5 per 1,000. That's lower than the rate for intellectual disability/mental retardation (12.0 per 1,000) but higher than the rate for ""'cerebral palsy'' (3.1 per 1,000), ''hearing loss'' (1.2 per 1,000), and vision impairment (1.2 per 1,000) found among children of the same age.' "
What are mitochondrial diseases?,"'Mitochondria are tiny parts of almost every cell in your body. Mitochondria are like the power house of the cells. They turn ''sugar'' and oxygen into energy that the cells need to work. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria cannot efficiently turn ''sugar'' and oxygen into energy, so the cells do not work the way they should.''There are many types of ''mitochondrial disease'', and they can affect different parts of the body: the brain, kidneys, muscles, heart, eyes, ears, and others. Mitochondrial diseases can affect one part of the body or many parts. The effects can be mild or very serious.''Not everyone with a mitochondrial disease will show symptoms. However, among the mitochondrial diseases that tend to affect children, symptoms usually appear in the toddler and preschool years.' "
Is there a link between mitochondrial diseases and ASDs?,"'A child with an ASD may or may not have a mitochondrial disease. When children have both an ASD and a mitochondrial disease, they sometimes have other problems too, including ''epilepsy'', problems with muscle tone, or movement disorders.''More research is needed to find out how common it is for people to have an ASD and a mitochondrial disease. Right now, it seems rare. In general, more research about mitochondrial disease and ASDs is needed.' "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "
What is an autopsy?,"'An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues. In academic institutions, autopsies sometimes are also requested for teaching and research purposes. Forensic autopsies have legal implications and are performed to determine if death was an accident, homicide, ''suicide'', or a natural event. The word autopsy is derived from the Greek word autopsia: ""to see with one\'s own eyes.""' "
Who determines whether an autopsy is performed?,"'A medical examiner can order an autopsy without the consent of the next-of-kin. Deaths that are investigated by the medical examiner or coroner include all suspicious deaths, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include deaths of persons not being treated by a physician for a known medical condition, deaths of those who have been under medical care for less than 24 hours, or deaths that occurred during operations or other medical procedures.''In all other cases, consent must be obtained from the next-of-kin before an autopsy is performed, even at academic institutions or hospitals. The next-of-kin also has the right to limit the scope of the autopsy (for example, excluding the brain from evaluation or limiting the procedure to examination of the abdomen).' "
How is an autopsy performed?,"'The extent of an autopsy can vary from the examination of a single organ such as the ''heart'' or brain, to a very extensive examination. Examination of the chest, abdomen, and brain is probably considered by most pathologists as the standard scope of the autopsy.''The autopsy begins with a complete external examination. The weight and height of the body are recorded, and identifying marks such as ''scars'' and tattoos also are recorded.''The internal examination begins with the creation of a Y or U- shaped incision from both shoulders joining over the sternum and continuing down to the pubic bone. The skin and underlying tissues are then separated to expose the rib cage and abdominal ''cavity''. The front of the rib cage is removed to expose the neck and chest organs. This opening allows the trachea (windpipe), thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, ''esophagus'', heart, thoracic ''aorta'' and ''lungs'' to be removed. Following removal of the neck and chest organs, the abdominal organs are cut (dissected) free. These include the ''intestines'', ''liver'', gallbladder and bile duct system, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, abdominal aorta, and reproductive organs.''To remove the brain, an incision is made in the back of the skull from one ear to the other. The ''scalp'' is cut and separated from the underlying skull and pulled forward. The top of the skull is removed using a vibrating saw. The entire brain is then gently lifted out of the cranial vault. The spinal cord may also be taken by removing the anterior or posterior portion of the spinal column.''The organs are first examined by the pathologist to note any changes visible with the naked eye. Examples of diseases that may produce changes readily recognizable in the organs include ''atherosclerosis'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''coronary artery disease'' in the heart. ''After the organs are removed from the body, they usually are separated from each other and further dissected to reveal any abnormalities, such as tumors, on the inside. Small samples are typically taken from all organs to be made into slide preparations for examination under a microscope. At the end of an autopsy, the incisions made in the body are sewn closed. The organs may be returned to the body or may be retained for teaching, research, and diagnostic purposes. Performance of an autopsy does not interfere with an open casket funeral service, as none of the incisions made in order to accomplish the autopsy are apparent after embalming and dressing of the body by the mortician.' "
What other special studies may be done as part of the autopsy?,"'Pictures of findings may be taken for future reference. Special studies may include cultures to identify infectious agents, chemical analysis for the measurement of drug levels or metabolic abnormalities, or genetic studies. Tissue may be frozen for future diagnostic or research purposes. Organs may be preserved and stored in formalin for later examination, sampling for microscopy, presentation at conferences, or archiving for the training of medical students.' "
What is the autopsy report?,"""After all studies are completed, a detailed report is prepared that describes the autopsy procedure and microscopic findings, gives a list of medical diagnoses, and a summary of the case. The report emphasizes the relationship or correlation between clinical findings (the doctor's examination, laboratory tests, radiology findings, etc.) and pathologic findings (those made from the autopsy)."" "
Why is the autopsy rate declining?,"'Beginning in the 1950s, hospital autopsy rates started falling from an average of around 50% of all deaths to 10% in the late 1990s. Currently, the rates are even lower at non-academic hospitals. In 1970, the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals dropped the requirement that a hospital needed an autopsy rate of 20% to be accredited.''Family factors:'' Certainly the relationship between patients and their doctors has changed dramatically over the past 50 years due to factors such as specialization, managed care, and the disappearance of the ""house call."" Physicians no longer are ""family doctors"" and do not have the same rapport with patients and their families as in past years. This change in the basic doctor-patient relationship may make it increasingly difficult to obtain consent for an autopsy.''Concerns over disfigurement of the remains or delays in funeral arrangements may prevent a vast majority of families from consenting to an autopsy. In reality, however, the visual examination of the body and the removal of tissues and organs for microscopic examination can be completed in a few hours. Furthermore, there are no visible external changes that would preclude an open-casket funeral service.''In the majority of cases and certainly at academic medical centers, there is currently no charge to the family and frequently, no compensation for its performance. More recently, though, some institutions have started to charge and private autopsies at the request of family members that are performed outside of the hospital may cost several thousand dollars.''Clinician factors: ''Most physicians are generally uncomfortable requesting an autopsy because it is not an easy or pleasant task. If, in addition, a physician feels that a family questions the care that their relative was given, the physician may be reluctant to request an autopsy that might prove that the care was indeed incorrect.''Many individuals in medicine feel that modern technology has made the autopsy outdated or obsolete. With modern imaging studies and laboratory tests, it is thought that the autopsy is unlikely to reveal any conditions that were not detected clinically. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis has been the subject of numerous research studies. These studies have consistently shown that in 20% to 40% of autopsied patients, there were important, treatable conditions that were detected at autopsy that were not diagnosed clinically. This consistent and significant discrepancy between clinical and pathologic diagnoses is probably the most compelling argument for continued efforts to revive the autopsy as the ""gold standard"" in evaluating the quality of medical care.''Pathologist factors: ''Some doctors express dissatisfaction with the quality of an autopsy if the pathologist does not provide answers regarding the case. Unfortunately, an autopsy does not guarantee that the cause of death, for example a heart ''arrhythmia'', will be identified.'""Autopsy pathology is a vanishing subspecialty, which, for the most part, has been relegated to a secondary position. At the turn of the century, most of the pathologist's activities revolved around the autopsy. Since that time, laboratory medicine and surgical pathology (examining tissue biopsies from living patients) have become the major activities of practicing pathologists.""'In addition, the autopsy is not one of the favorite activities among the majority of pathologists. For many pathologists, an autopsy is an extra burden with no compensation during a busy day.' "
What are the benefits of autopsies?,"'Benefits for families:'"" For families, the autopsy has both tangible and psychological benefits. Uncertainty regarding the cause of an individual's death can delay payment of insurance benefits. The autopsy can also uncover genetic or environmental (for example, a bacterium or fungus) causes of disease that could affect other family members. Psychologically, the autopsy provides closure by identifying or confirming the cause of death. The autopsy can demonstrate to the family that the care provided was appropriate, thereby alleviating guilt among family members and offering reassurance regarding the quality of medical care. Lastly, the autopsy is a mechanism that enables the family to participate in medical education and research.""'Benefits for the clinician and hospital:'' The procedure can confirm the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses and the appropriateness of medical care. The autopsy findings can be utilized to educate physicians, nurses, residents, and students, thereby contributing to an improved quality of care.''Benefits to society:'' Many of the benefits of the autopsy are experienced by society as a whole. The autopsy aids in the evaluation of new diagnostic tests, the assessment of new therapeutic interventions (''drugs'', devices, surgical techniques), and the investigation of environmental and occupational diseases. Autopsy data are useful in establishing valid mortality statistics. Data derived from death certificates in the absence of autopsy data have repeatedly been shown to be inaccurate. New medical knowledge on existing diseases that is derived from autopsy-based research is clearly important for everyone. Remarkably, new diseases continue to emerge which can only be fully investigated by autopsy.' "
Who pays for autopsies?,"""Presently, there is no direct funding to hospitals or doctors for autopsies. As part of the federal government's Medicare funding to hospitals, reimbursement for autopsies is theoretically included in fixed payments that hospitals receive. Thus, the federal government contends that it is paying for autopsies. Since these funds are not specifically earmarked for autopsies, they may not reach the pathology department or pathologist. Managed care organizations consider the autopsy to be built into their hospital contracts. However, these organizations have stated that they are willing to reimburse for autopsies if and when they are convinced of their value. Sometimes in hospital autopsies performed at the request of physicians, the autopsy is not billed to the patient's family, but they should check with the hospital performing the service. This is different from autopsies the family requests of private pathologists, which may lead to charges billed to the deceased's next-of-kin.""'In our litigation-oriented society, a growing proportion of private-pay autopsies are motivated by distrust, anger, and a desire to sue the potentially responsible physician(s) and hospital. Several groups of pathologists and business persons throughout the country are marketing their autopsy services through direct mail, newspapers, funeral homes, and online. Whether the quality and objectivity of these private autopsies will match those of general hospitals and academic medical centers remains to be determined.' "
What is the history of the autopsy?,"'The earliest anatomists and pathologists could be considered ancient hunters, butchers, and cooks who had to recognize organs and determine if they were suitably edible. In ancient Babylon, perhaps as early as 3500 BC, autopsies on animals were performed not for the study of disease, but rather for the practice of predicting the future by communicating with divine forces. The intestines and liver were believed to contain messages from divine spirits.'""Galen (131-200 A.D.), a disciple of Hippocrates practicing in ancient Greece, performed surgical dismantling (dissection) of animals and humans. He determined that Hippocrates' theory that disease was due to four circulating humours (""'phlegm'', blood, yellow bile, and black bile) was correct. Galen was a highly respected, powerful, and dogmatic individual who dominated the medical thinking of his time and for hundreds of years to follow. It is said that the four humour doctrine paralyzed medical science for about 1400 years.''In general, before 1700 there was a negative attitude regarding dissection of the ''human body''. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and medieval Europeans performed dissections for religious reasons or to learn anatomy, but this was not done in any systematic fashion. There were, however, some notable exceptions. In the late 1200s the law faculty dominated the University of Bologna and would order autopsies to be performed to help solve legal problems. Thus, some of the earliest autopsies were medicolegal cases. In the late 1400s in Padua and Bologna, Italy, the sites of the world\'s first medical schools, Pope Sixtus the IV issued an edict permitting dissection of the human body by medical students. Before such edicts from religious leaders, it was considered a crime to dissect the human body and criminal prosecutions for ""body snatching"" by students of anatomy date back to the early 1300s.''By the 1500s, the autopsy was generally accepted by the Catholic Church, marking the way for an accepted systematic approach for the study of human pathology. While a number of ""giants"" around this time, such as Vesalius (1514-1564), Pare (1510-1590), Lancisi (1654- 1720), and Boerhaave (1668-1738) advanced the autopsy, it is Giovanni Bathista Morgagni (1682-1771) who has been considered the first great autopsist. During his 60 years of observations, Morgagni insisted upon correlation of pathological findings with clinical symptoms, marking the first time that autopsies made major contributions to the understanding of disease in medical science.'""Some historians say that the power of the autopsy in medical education peaked during the 1800s. In the beginning of that century the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Vienna was considered the premiere medical center of the Western World, in large part because of the stature of its Pathology Institute which was headed by Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878). Almost every patient who died was taken to the Rokitansky Institute, which still exists in Vienna, for autopsy. Rokitansky is said to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years. Rokitansky stressed a systematic, almost ritualistic, approach to the autopsy with every patient receiving the same detailed examination. For the sake of objectivity, Rokitansky, unlike Morgagni, did not care to know the clinical history of the patients. Because of this style and his disinclination to apply microscopy in a routine fashion, many of Rokitansky's theories about diseases proved to be incorrect.""'Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902), an eminent German statesman and pathologist, was a younger contemporary and competitor of Rokitansky. Unlike Rokitansky, he grew up with the microscope, and was most influential in the systematic application of microscopy to study disease. Virchow advanced the doctrine which held that cellular pathology was the basis of disease, finally laying to rest the humoural theory of Hippocrates and Galen. In many ways, Virchow could be considered the first molecular biologist. Under Virchow, Berlin replaced Vienna as the premier center of medical education.''Many clinicians, upon returning from study in Berlin, became leaders in North American medicine. The most notable of these physicians was the legendary Sir William Osler, who worked in Canada and the US. Osler was arguably the most respected and revered North American physician of his time. He studied with Rokitansky and Virchow and relied heavily on autopsy studies for his own education. Osler not only performed autopsies himself and taught others from autopsies, but also left detailed instructions for his own autopsy. In speaking of himself, Osler told a friend: ""I\'ve been watching this case for 2 months and I\'m sorry I shall not see the postmortem."" As expected, the autopsy showed that all of Osler\'s diagnoses were correct.''In 1910, Abraham Flexner reported the sorry state of medical education in the U. S. at that time. The Cabot report issued from the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1920, based on approximately 3000 autopsies performed, revealed astonishing diagnostic inaccuracies on the part of clinicians. Resulting medical reforms included the placement of autopsy pathology as a central, integral component of medical education.' "
Should the autopsy be revived?,"'Government agencies that regulate the accreditation of hospitals and ''nursing'' homes are deeply concerned about the decline in autopsy rates. For example, surveys have indicated that less than 1% of nursing home patients who die are autopsied. The U.S. general accounting office, which pays for some nursing home services, recently attempted to prove that particular nursing homes were substandard. Such efforts were thwarted by the lack of hard evidence. The allegations could not be proven because the patients in question were not autopsied and the actual ''causes of death'' could not, therefore, be confirmed.''Some information can only be acquired during an autopsy. The information autopsies can provide benefits society, the medical profession, and families. Many physicians believe that autopsy should be revived. Whether or not it will be revived remains to be seen.' "
What is aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis is a bone condition that results from poor blood supply to an area of bone, causing localized bone death.  This is a serious condition because the dead areas of bone do not function normally, are weakened, and can collapse. Aseptic necrosis is also referred to as avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis. ' "
What causes aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis can be caused by trauma and damage to the blood vessels that supply bone its oxygen. Other causes of poor blood circulation to the bone include a blockage by air or fat (embolism) that obstructs the blood flow through the blood vessels, abnormally thick blood (hypercoagulable state), atherosclerosis (''hardening of the arteries''), or inflammation of the blood vessel walls (''vasculitis''). Steroid medications (cortisone, such as prednisone [Deltasone, Liquid Pred] and methylprednisolone [Medrol, Depo-Medrol]) are the most common medications to cause aseptic necrosis. Typical bones affected by steroids include the femur bone of the hip, the humerus bone of the shoulder, and the tibia bone of the knee, sometimes in combinations and frequently affecting both sides of the body (bilateral). Aseptic necrosis of the jawbone has been associated with the use of medications (bisphosphonates) used to treat high blood calcium levels from ''cancer''.'  "
What are risk factors for aseptic necrosis?,"""Conditions that are risk factors associated with aseptic necrosis include alcoholism, cortisone medications, Cushing's syndrome, radiation exposure, ""'smoking'' cigarettes, sickle cell disease, pancreatitis, ''hyperlipidemia'"", Caisson's disease (dysbarism), ""'Gaucher'' disease, and  ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. Aseptic necrosis of the jawbone has been rarely reported in association with the use of bisphosphonate medication, particularly intravenously including zoledronate (''Zometa'') and pamidronate (''Aredia''). '  "
What are aseptic necrosis symptoms and signs?,"'Aseptic necrosis begins as a painless bone abnormality. It can remain painless. The involved bone often later develops ''pain'', especially with use. For example, if a hip joint develops avascular necrosis in the ball of the hip joint, pain can be noted, especially upon weight-bearing. As the ball of the hip joint collapses from the degeneration of the bone from aseptic necrosis, pain in the groin can be felt with hip rotation and pain can sometimes be noted with rest after weight-bearing. Aseptic necrosis of the knee is often associated with pain or ''limping'' with ''walking''. Aseptic necrosis of the shoulder can be associated with pain and loss of range of motion of the shoulder joint.'  "
How do physicians diagnose aseptic necrosis?,"'The diagnosis of aseptic necrosis can often, but not always, be made with plain film ''X-rays''. By the time changes are apparent by plain film X-ray testing there has been substantial damage to the bone affected. Bone changes visible on plain film X-ray are, therefore, considered a later-stage finding. Earlier signs of avascular necrosis can be detected with an ''MRI'' scan image or suggested by a nuclear ''bone scan'' image.' "
What is the treatment for aseptic necrosis?,"'The treatment of aseptic necrosis is critically dependent on the stage of the condition. Very early stage aseptic necrosis may be managed nonoperatively with rest, partial-weight-bearing crutches, progressive weight-bearing, and observation. Nevertheless, there is often progression of the joint damage. Early aseptic necrosis (before X-ray image changes are evident) can be treated with a surgical operation called a core decompression. This procedure involves removing a core of bone from the involved area and sometimes grafting new bone into the area. This allows new blood supply to form, preserving the bone. Weight-bearing or impact of the involved joint is restricted.''Later stages of aseptic necrosis (when X-ray image changes are apparent) typically lead to seriously damaged bone and joints, requiring joint replacement surgery.'  "
What is the prognosis of aseptic necrosis?,"'Aseptic necrosis causes a serious injury to affected bone. Frequently, this leads to permanent destruction of the adjacent joint. Early core decompression is generally necessary to prevent  collapse of affected bone. Aseptic necrosis can be complicated by complete loss of joint function.' "
Is it possible to prevent aseptic necrosis?,"'People can prevent aseptic necrosis by minimizing the use of steroid medications when possible and by treating underlying medical conditions, such as those described above, that can increase the risk of developing aseptic necrosis. Avoiding trauma to joints can prevent posttraumatic aseptic necrosis. Avoiding ''smoking'' can decrease risk of developing aseptic necrosis.' "
What is bird flu?,"'Bird flu (avian influenza) is a disease caused by strains of influenza virus that primarily affects birds. In the late 1990s, a new strain of bird flu arose that was remarkable for its ability to cause severe disease and death, especially in domesticated birds such as ducks, chickens, or turkeys. As a result, this strain was called highly pathogenic (meaning very severe and contagious) avian influenza and termed H5N1.''A new strain of bird flu was identified in China in 2013. The influenza A virus is termed H7N9 (H7N9 Chinese bird flu). The identification of the virus (H7N9) was reported Mar. 31, 2013; the strain is antigenically different from the H5N1 bird flu virus. Unfortunately, the H7N9 strain of bird flu seems to be genetically unstable. Since its discovery, at least 48 different subtypes of H7N9 have been identified. Because some H7N9 ''viruses'' are persistent in some chicken flocks in China, researchers are concerned that the strains will continue to swap genes with other flu viruses and may start a new pandemic.''Since the identification of highly pathogenic influenza, infected birds have been found in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Careful control measures, including destroying infected flocks and vaccinating healthy birds, have reduced the number of cases, but the virus continues to exist in poultry flocks in areas of Asia and Africa. In 2007-2008, there were small outbreaks in Bangladesh and Pakistan due to infected domestic chicken flocks.''In March 2015 in Arkansas and Missouri, the U.S. Department of Agriculture detected bird flu (H5N2) in several flocks of turkeys, including flocks used to produce the popular Butterball turkeys. This resulted in a number of countries banning U.S. poultry products and had a significant effect on U.S. poultry exports at the time.''Similarly, the Dutch poultry industry was affected by the spread of bird flu in chickens in March 2015. Most experts agree that commercial poultry became infected with bird flu due to contamination by wild bird feces.''As of March 2015, no bird flu infections have been reported in humans in the U.S. Although the ''H1N1'' ""''swine flu''"" pandemic strain contained some bird flu genes, it was not the same strain as the original H5N1 bird flu.''The virus spreads through infected birds shedding the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and droppings. Healthy birds get infected when they come into contact with contaminated secretions or feces from infected birds. Contact with contaminated surfaces such as cages might also allow the virus to transfer from bird to bird. Symptoms in birds range from mild drops in egg production to failure of multiple major organs and death.''The history of bird flu in humans is short. The first human case of illness from highly pathogenic avian influenza (termed HPAI in older literature) was identified in 1997. Since that time, H5N1 has infected 784 individuals with 429 deaths. Human cases of highly pathogenic bird flu have been largely confined to Southeast Asia (India, Bangladesh) and Africa. Mutations often occur in the virus, and it is possible that some mutations could create a more contagious virus that could cause a regional epidemic or a worldwide pandemic of bird flu among humans. Fortunately, the mutations that have occurred to date have not made the virus more contagious, although the concern remains. The identification of H7N9 bird flu strain is worrisome. However, four people in China (two in Shanghai, one in Nanjing, and one in Anhui province) have been identified as being infected with H7N9; two have died. Health officials worldwide are concerned because of the possibility of a bird flu type that could develop easy transmission from birds to humans. Although easy transmission between humans has not yet developed, H7N9 avian influenza virus has infected 622 individuals; 227 of these individuals died from infection to date. The majority of these infections were due to exposure to infected birds or their droppings.''In January 2016, an outbreak of H7N8 was reported in turkeys in Indiana; eventually, nine to 10 farms became infected, and thousands of turkeys were killed and the outbreak halted. There were no reports of human infection.'  "
What causes bird flu?,"'Bird flu is caused by strains of the influenza virus that have evolved to be specially adapted to enter avian cells. There are three main types of influenza: A, B, and C. The virus that causes bird flu is influenza A type with eight RNA strands that make up its genome. Influenza viruses are further classified by analyzing two proteins on the surface of the virus. The proteins are called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are many different types of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. For example, the recent pathogenic bird flu virus has type 5 hemagglutinin and type 1 neuraminidase. Thus, it is named ""H5N1"" influenza A virus (also termed HPAI or highly pathogenic avian influenza). The 2013 virus has different surface proteins, H7 and N9, hence the name H7N9. Other bird flu types include H7N7, H5N8, H5N2, and H9N2.''There are many types of influenza viruses, and most prefer to live in a limited number of animals. Thus, swine flu primarily infects swine, and bird flu primarily infects birds. Human influenza strains are best adapted to humans. A few cases may occur in an accidental host, such as when people who have extensive contact with sick birds get the bird flu. In addition to humans and birds, we know pigs, tigers, leopards, ferrets, and domestic cats and ''dogs'' can sometimes be infected with avian influenza viruses.'""Influenza viruses mutate easily and often. These mutations can arise spontaneously in a single virus or can occur when two different influenza strains get close enough together to exchange genetic material. There are two major types of mutations in influenza viruses: antigenic shifts, where large RNA segments are interchanged between different influenza virus type, and antigenic drifts, where small RNA sequences are changed. The antigenic shifts are usually responsible for developing new strains. For example, the 2009 swine flu pandemic was caused by a virus that included genetic material from pig influenza, avian influenza, and human influenza strains. New mutations can allow the virus to evade the body's immune system and makes older ""'vaccines'' ineffective. In 2011, one strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus mutated in this way, making the existing vaccine used against avian flu ineffective against the new strain. Sometimes a flu virus will mutate in a way that makes it able to infect a new species.''Serious pandemic influenza occurs when a relatively new strain of the influenza virus arises that is highly contagious to humans. The most deadly pandemic in modern history was the 1918 influenza, also known as the Spanish flu (although it did not originate in Spain). The 1918 virus spread rapidly and killed tens of millions of people worldwide. Mortality was especially high in healthy young adults. Although the 1918 virus was a human influenza virus, it had many genes that likely came from a strain of bird flu. One reason health officials carefully watch for and try to limit human contact with birds that develop avian flu is to avoid chances for a new strain to arise that may prefer to develop in human tissue.' "
What are risk factors for bird flu?,"'Humans may get bird flu from contact with infected birds (chickens, for example) or their infected droppings and secretions. Risk factors include caring for sick birds, killing sick birds, and preparing sick birds for consumption. Despite the large number of people who have contact with poultry every day in the world, human cases of bird flu remain rare. This highlights how difficult it is for the bird flu virus to infect human cells, but mutations like antigenic shifts may reduce such difficulties. The H1N1 pandemic that started in Mexico is an example of such a mutation (swine flu to human flu).''Although direct contact with sick poultry poses the highest risk for bird flu, indirect exposure to bird feces or other materials such as bird eggs is also a risk. Contact with unwashed eggs from sick birds or water contaminated by poultry feces poses a potential risk of disease.' "
Is bird flu contagious?,"'Bird flu is very contagious among many bird species. In general, bird flu is not very contagious to humans, even to poultry workers. However, human-to-human spread has occurred in isolated cases. In human outbreaks, the first individual to become infected usually has had contact with infected birds or poultry and then caregivers become infected. Thus, caring for a person infected with bird flu is also a risk factor for the disease. There is a theoretical risk in laboratory workers who handle the avian flu virus. One alleged incident in 2009 occurred when a company inadvertently sent live avian flu virus samples to research laboratories, which subsequently were used to vaccinate ferrets. The contaminated vaccine did not result in any human infections.' "
What types of specialists treat bird flu?,"'Veterinarians and poultry workers usually treat bird flu in commercial outbreaks. In rare human outbreaks, primary-care physicians, pediatricians, and emergency-medicine specialists may initially treat patients but individuals with severe complications may be treated by infectious-disease specialists, critical-care specialists, hospitalists, and pulmonologists.' "
What are bird flu symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms occur approximately two to eight days after exposure, on average. Infected people experience typical ''flu-like symptoms'' that may include''Children get similar symptoms. This viral infection can progress to ''pneumonia'' and even respiratory failure. Bird flu causes a very aggressive form of ''pneumonia'' (''acute respiratory distress syndrome'' or ''ARDS'') that is often fatal.'   fever (above 38 C or 100.4 F), feeling unwell (malaise), cough (usually dry or nonproductive of sputum), sore throat, muscle aches and/or pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, joint pain, lethargy, nasal secretions (runny nose or sneezing), insomnia, and eye infections (conjunctivitis)."
How do physicians diagnose bird flu?,"'Routine tests for human influenza A will be positive in patients with bird flu but are not specific for the avian virus. To make a specific diagnosis of bird flu, specialized tests are needed. In the United States, local health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) can provide access to the specialized testing. The virus can be detected in sputum by several methods, including culture or ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR''). Cultures should be done in laboratories that have an appropriate biosafety certification. PCR detects nucleic acid from the influenza A virus. Specialized PCR testing is available in reference laboratories to identify avian strains; the CDC is a primary source for available tests for the newest strains of bird flu and can identify the specific type of virus (for example, H5N1 or H7N9).''During and after infection with bird flu, the body makes antibodies against the virus. Blood tests can detect these antibodies, but this requires one sample at the onset of disease and another sample several weeks later. Thus, results are usually not available until the patient has recovered or died.' "
What is the treatment for bird flu?,"'Because of the small number of human cases, it has not been possible to conduct rigorous medical or medication treatment trials for bird flu. The CDC suggests the best way to prevent bird flu is to avoid exposure whenever possible to birds and their feces. People are advised not to touch any ill-appearing or dead birds. The CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommend antiviral ''drugs'' ''oseltamivir'' (''Tamiflu'') and ''zanamivir'' (''Relenza'') for the treatment and prevention of avian influenza A viruses along with supportive care. The U.S. government is currently stockpiling H5N1 vaccine in case the virus begins easy person-to-person transmission. Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against H7N9 types of bird flu.' "
What are the complications of bird flu?,"'The complications of bird flu are frequently dire and include''Unfortunately, individuals who become infected with bird flu often have one or more the complications listed above. The mortality (death) rate varies somewhat between strains with H5N1 at about 55%, and H7N9 at about 37%.' shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), abdominal pain, lung collapse, shock, altered mental status, seizures, organ system failure, and death."
What is the prognosis of bird flu?,"'The prognosis in human cases of bird flu remains poor. Many cases occur in people who are poor, live in rural areas in underdeveloped countries, and do not have access to modern intensive-care units or antiviral therapy. Approximately 55% of people diagnosed with H5N1 bird flu eventually die from the disease; the H7N9 strain has a similar death rate of about 37%. Individuals who survive may have long-term problems if organ systems are severely damaged.' "
Is it possible to prevent bird flu with a vaccine?,"'Although the U.S. government has a stockpile of vaccine against H5N1 bird flu, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans against any bird flu strains. However, bird flu can be prevented by avoiding contact with sick poultry originating in countries known to be affected by the virus. Prevention also includes poultry-safety measures such as destroying flocks when sick birds are identified and vaccinating healthy flocks. Combined with import bans, this culling has effectively limited the spread of bird flu in outbreak situations but naturally has negative effects on the poultry and egg industry. Unlike ''SARS'', which some investigators suggest has been eliminated from the world, or ''Ebola'', which has a narrow geographic range (endemic in Africa), the bird flu continues to exist in significant areas of the world and can be spread widely by migrating birds. The poultry industry needs to follow Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines to protect their industry and workers from bird flu.''Properly handling and cooking of poultry and eggs can kill viruses like the bird flu virus. Hands should be washed before and after handling poultry and eggs, and surfaces that have come in contact with the food should be cleaned thoroughly with hot soapy water. Cooked poultry should have an internal temperature of at least 165 F (74 C).''Masks and other respiratory protection should be used when caring for patients with bird flu. If a person has close contact with an infected patient, the exposed person may be offered oseltamivir in an attempt to prevent infection.'""In 2007, the FDA licensed the first vaccine in the U.S. for humans against the highly pathogenic bird flu virus. The vaccine is made from inactivated viruses and does not contain any live viruses. It has been shown to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against the bird flu virus that could presumably protect a person from the bird flu. The vaccine has been purchased by the federal government for inclusion within the CDC's Strategic National Stockpile. It is not available to the general public in part because the United States does not currently have a problem with the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu. Vaccine side effects include a sore arm, ""'fatigue'', or temporary muscle aches. The vaccine has not been tested in large numbers of patients, however, and there may be other side effects that have not yet been detected. The current vaccine is effective against the strain that has caused the large outbreaks of bird flu, but it may not be as effective against a newly mutated strain found in 2011. Consequently, this vaccine seems unlikely to offer protection against the new H7N9 bird flu, but data is not available to date.''Research on ''vaccines'' against influenza viruses is ongoing, and new developments such as a vaccine that is directed against the common and relatively unchanging antigens on the influenza viruses may lead to a vaccine that is protective against most if not all influenza viruses. If such research is successful, potential influenza outbreaks, including avian flu, may be reduced or prevented in the future. Just before the outbreak of H7N9 flu, an article published in 2013 presented data on an experimental vaccine that was effective against flu viruses that possessed the N9 antigen, but it has only been tried in animal models.'
