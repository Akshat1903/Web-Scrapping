Questions,Answer
What is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series (barium swallow), is a radiological test that is used to visualize the structures of the upper ''digestive system'' - the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. (If visualization of the remaining parts of the small intestine is necessary, a small bowel follow through\xa0 can be added to the test.) These structures are observed during the examination, and the images are also\xa0 saved for further review on X-ray film or as digital images. An upper GI series can reveal conditions such as ulcers, tumors, hiatal hernias, scarring, blockages, and abnormalities of the muscular wall of the gastrointestinal tissues.' "
What are the risks of an upper GI series?,"' Any x-ray test procedure involves some risk from ''radiation'' exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques that have been assigned and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils.  Radiology technicians are certified by national certifying boards.''Patients who are or may be pregnant should notify the requesting practitioner and radiology staff, as there is potential risk of harm to the fetus with any  radiation exposure.' "
"How does a patient prepare for an upper GI series, and how is it performed?","'A radiology technologist guides the patient through the upper GI series along with a radiologist (a physician trained in performing and interpreting ''x-rays''). Because an upper GI series involves interpreting images of the gastrointestinal system, it is important that any materials or objects internally or externally that could potentially interfere with interpretation of the X-ray film be avoided. Therefore, patients are requested not to eat or drink anything from four to eight hours before the procedure. Patients also are asked to remove their clothing and all metallic objects such as jewelry.''As barium passes through the digestive system, ''constipation'' can result, especially in patients prone to ''constipation''. Therefore, it generally is advisable that patients who undergo an upper GI series drink extra fluids after the test and consider a ''laxative'' to relieve the bowels of the barium if the barium is not eliminated completely within the next day or two. As it is passing in the ''stool'', barium has a whitish appearance that maybe apparent for several days after the test.'   A patient will be positioned behind X-ray equipment called a fluoroscope for X-ray exposure. The patient then is asked to swallow a liquid that contains barium. The barium fills and then coats the lining of the intestinal tract making the adjacent esophagus, stomach and duodenum visible. (X-rays of the stomach and intestine done without barium provide very little detail and information.) X-ray images are obtained at different angles through the chest and abdomen. The X-ray machine (fluoroscope) produces these images by sending X-ray radiation through the tissues of the body to a film on the opposite side of the patient's body. As the radiation penetrates the body, it is absorbed in varying amounts by different body tissues. Due to differences in their composition, the different organs and certain abnormalities and conditions all become visible on the X-ray film, by blocking the penetration of the X-ray beam to varying degrees. After development of the film, an image of the organs is revealed. The radiologist then examines the X-rays and can identify various normal and abnormal structures of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, further enhancement of the different structures can be obtained by having air as well as barium in the stomach. This is accomplished by swallowing baking soda crystals."
How does the patient obtain the results of the upper GI series?,"'After the radiology technician develops the X-ray film or digital image, it is transferred to the radiologist. This physician interprets the films. The radiologist then generates a report that is transmitted to the physician who requested the test. The radiologist and the practitioner often review the findings together. The practitioner can review the results of the upper GI series with the patient and can proceed with therapy or discuss whether other tests may be necessary.' "
Facts you should know about X-rays,"  X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through solid objects, including the body. X-rays penetrate different objects more or less according to their density. In medicine, X-rays are used to view images of the bones and other structures in the body. X-rays were first discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, a German physics professor. Roentgen also studied X-rays and their ability to pass through human tissues to produce images of the bones and metals visible on developed film. To obtain an X-ray image of a part of the body, a patient is positioned so the part of the body being X-rayed is between the source of the X-ray and an X-ray detector. As the X-rays pass through the body, images appear in shades of black and white, depending on the type of tissue the X-rays pass through. For example, the calcium in your bones makes them denser, so they absorb more radiation and appear white on X-rays. Thus when a bone is broken (fractured), the fracture line will appear as a dark area within the lighter bone on an X-ray film. Less dense tissue such as muscle or fat absorbs less, and these structures appear in shades of gray on X-ray film. Air absorbs little of the X-rays, so the lungs and any air-filled cavities appear black on an X-ray film. If pneumonia or tumors are present in the lungs, they are denser than the air-filled areas of the lungs and they will appear as whiter spots on X-ray film."
What are uses of X-rays?,"'The most common form of X-ray used is X-ray radiography, which can be used to help detect or diagnose: '  
Bone fractures  Infections (such as pneumonia) Calcifications (like kidney stones or 
vascular calcifications) Some tumors 
Arthritis in joints Bone loss (such as osteoporosis) Dental issues Heart problems (such as 
	congestive heart failure) Blood vessel blockages Digestive problems Foreign objects (such as items 
swallowed by children)"
Is it safe to have X-rays while pregnant or breastfeeding?,"'The risk of side effects of an X-ray while you are ''pregnant'' is extremely minimal, but it is always important to protect the developing fetus from harm. You should always tell your health-care professional if you are or think you may be ''pregnant'' if an X-ray exam is prescribed. ''X-ray examinations of areas of the body including the arms, legs, chest, head, or ''teeth'' do not expose your reproductive organs or your unborn child to a direct X-ray beam. X-rays of the abdomen, stomach, kidneys, lower back, or pelvis can potentially expose an unborn child to the direct X-ray beam. Depending on your condition and the area that needs to be X-rayed, your doctor may cancel or postpone your X-ray exam if you are pregnant. The X-ray exam also may be modified to reduce the radiation. Often the risk of not having a necessary X-ray can be greater than the risk of the radiation. ''It is safe to have X-ray tests while ''breastfeeding''. The radiation does not affect the milk or the baby, and ''breastfeeding'' is safe after a regular X-ray. Mammograms may be more difficult to read in a lactating mother, but women who are breastfeeding can continue to do so even if they need a ''mammogram''. In the case of X-rays used with contrast media, it is safe to breastfeed as long as there is no radioactive isotope used in the contrast. If there is a radioactive isotope used, your doctor may recommend you stop breastfeeding for a short time. Ask your doctor about the contrast agent used and let them know that if you are breastfeeding. ' "
What are the types of X-rays?,"'There are many types of X-rays that are used to diagnose conditions and diseases. The following are examples.' 

Mammography is a type of X-ray radiograph that is used to detect breast 
cancer.  Computed tomography (CT) scans combine X-ray with computer processing to 
create detailed pictures (scans) of cross sections of the body that are combined 
to form a three-dimensional X-ray image.  Fluoroscopy uses X-rays and a fluorescent screen to study moving or real-time 
structures in the body, such as viewing the heart beating. It can also be used 
in combination with swallowed or injected contrast agents to view the digestive 
processes or blood flow. 
	Cardiac angioplasty uses fluoroscopy with a contrast 
agent to guide an internally threaded catheter to help open clogged arteries. 
Fluoroscopy is also used to precisely place instruments in certain locations 
within the body, such as during epidural injections or joint aspirations. Other uses for X-rays and other types of radiation include cancer treatment. 
High-energy radiation in much higher doses than what is used for X-ray imaging 
may be utilized to help destroy cancerous cells and tumors by damaging their 
DNA. "
What are the dangers and risks of X-rays?,"'Radiation does have some risks to consider, but it is also important to remember X-rays can help detect disease or injury at early stages so the ailment can be treated appropriately. Sometimes X-ray testing can be life-saving. ''The risk from X-rays comes from the radiation they produce, which can harm living tissues. This risk is relatively small, but it increases with cumulative exposure. That is, the more you are exposed to radiation over your lifetime, the higher your risk of harm from the radiation. ''There is a slight increased risk of developing ''cancer'' later in life after X-ray exposure. X-rays have also been linked to ''cataracts'' in the eyes and ''skin burns'', but only at extremely high levels of radiation. ''Things that are risk factors for X-ray damage include:''Things you can do to reduce radiation risks from X-rays: ' A higher number of X-ray exams Receiving X-rays at a younger age Being female (women have a slightly 
higher lifetime risk than men for developing radiation-associated cancer) Keep track of your X-ray history and 
make sure your doctors are aware of it Ask your health-care professional if there 
are alternative tests to X-ray exams If you are pregnant or think you may be 
pregnant, tell the X-ray technician or radiologist"
How do I prepare for an X-ray exam?,"'There is no special preparation needed for a regular diagnostic X-ray. You may be asked to strip down and wear a hospital gown, or at least remove clothing on the part of the body that needs to be X-rayed. You may be asked to remove any metal objects such as ''eyeglasses'', jewelry, or watches that may interfere. If you are getting an X-ray with contrast such as barium or ''iodine'', you may be given a liquid to swallow, an injection, or enema with the agent prior to the X-ray. If you are getting an X-ray of your gastrointestinal tract you may be told not to eat or drink anything for 8 or more hours before the procedure so your stomach is empty. Your doctor will tell you if you need to do this.''An X-ray technician will position you on an exam table and give instructions on how you should position your body for the X-ray. You can ask questions if you have them. ' "
How do medical professionals perform an X-ray?,"'The X-ray test works by positioning the part of the body being X-rayed between the source of the X-ray and an X-ray detector (such as a film). You usually will need to lie on a table or stand against a flat surface to ensure your body is in the right place for the X-rays to pass through the body part being examined. You will be asked to stay still so the image will be as clear as possible. This will provide the most accurate image. ''Dental X-rays'' usually involve biting on a piece of film.''A radiology technician will aim the X-ray machine at the body part that needs to be X-rayed, and then they will leave the room or go behind a screen to turn on the machine. The actual X-ray usually only takes a fraction of a second, and you will not feel anything when it occurs.''The radiology technician may return and reposition your body or the X-ray slide to take additional X-rays from multiple angles.''The entire procedure for a regular usually only takes a few minutes. If contrast agents are used, a procedure may take an hour or more.' "
What are the side effects of contrast agents?,"'If contrast agents are used, you may experience some side effects. ''Side effects of barium include: ''Side effects of iodine include: '  Nausea Vomiting Stomach cramps Diarrhea Constipation Allergic reactions (tell your doctor 
immediately if these occur): hives, itching, skin redness, swelling of the 
throat, hoarseness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, agitation, confusion, 
fast heartbeat Nausea  Vomiting  Metallic taste in the mouth  Headache  Itching  Flushing 
 Lightheadedness  Skin rash or hives  Wheezing  Abnormal heart rhythms  High or low 
blood pressure  Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing"
What happens after the X-ray procedure?,"'There are no side effects or after-effects of a regular X-ray and you should be able to return to your normal daily activities immediately. ''If you had an X-ray with contrast, there may be some temporary side effects. Barium may cause your ''stool'' to turn a whitish color, and iodine injections may cause some people to feel sick or develop a ''rash''. Injections given to relax the stomach before an X-ray of that body part may cause temporary ''blurred vision''. You will likely be instructed to drink plenty of fluids after an X-ray with contrast to help your body rid itself of these agents. ' "
When and how will I receive the results of my X-rays?,"'After an X-ray is taken, the image is produced immediately. However, the time it takes to learn the results varies. '""If your X-ray is taken in a doctor's or dentist's office, the doctor or dentist will likely read the X-ray and discuss results with you in the same visit. If your X-ray is taken while you are in a hospital's emergency department, or in-patient in a hospital it will be read by the emergency physician or sent to a radiologist to read. Depending on how busy the hospital is, this can take a few hours. Once read, it will be sent to the physician treating you, who will discuss the findings. ""'Sometimes, you may be sent to an imaging center to have your X-rays taken. Once the X-rays are done, they will be read by a radiologist on staff at the imaging center, and then transmitted to your doctor who ordered the tests. This may take a day or more. Once your doctor receives the results, they will likely call you to discuss the results over the phone or suggest a follow-up visit in office, or they may refer you to another doctor depending on the findings. ' "
"What is 
XDR TB?","'Extensively drug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (XDR ''TB'') is a relatively rare type of multidrug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (MDR ''TB''). It is resistant to almost all ''drugs'' used to treat TB, including the two best first-line drugs: ''isoniazid'' and rifampin. XDR TB is also resistant to the best second-line medications: fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). ' "
How is XDR TB spread?,"'Drug-susceptible (regular) TB and XDR TB are spread the same way. TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the ''lungs'' or throat ''coughs'', sneezes, speaks, or sings. These germs can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB germs can become infected. ''TB is not spread by' shaking someone's hand sharing food or drink touching bed linens or toilet 
seats sharing toothbrushes kissing smoking or sharing cigarettes"
"Why is XDR TB 
so serious?","'Because XDR TB is resistant to the most powerful first-line and second-line drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective and often have worse treatment outcomes. XDR TB is of special concern for persons with ''HIV'' infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB disease. ' "
Who is at risk for getting XDR TB?,"'Drug-resistant TB (MDR or XDR) is more common in people who: '   Do not take their TB medicine regularly Do not take all of their TB medicines 
as told by their doctor or nurse Develop active TB disease again, after having 
taken TB medicine in the past Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant 
TB is common Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB 
disease"
How can I prevent myself from getting TB?,"'Avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments like clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. ' "
Can the TB vaccine (BCG) help prevent XDR TB?,"'There is a ''vaccine'' for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB in adults. The effect of BCG against XDR TB would likely be similar to the effect on drug-susceptible TB. ' "
"If I have regular (drug-susceptible) TB, how can I prevent getting 
drug-resistant TB?","'The most important thing is for you to continue taking all your TB medicines exactly as prescribed. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. You should tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medications. If you plan to travel, make sure you have enough medicine to last while away. ' "
Can XDR TB be treated and cured?,"'Yes, in some cases. Some TB control programs have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% of affected people. Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the ''drug resistance'"", the severity of the disease, and whether the patient's immune system is weakened."" "
What are the symptoms of XDR TB?,"'The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fever'', and ''night sweats''. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include ''coughing'', ''chest pain'', and ''coughing up blood''. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department. ' "
What should I do if I have been around someone who has XDR TB?,"'If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G), a blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person. ' "
How long does it take to find out if you have XDR TB?,"'If TB bacteria are found in the sputum (''phlegm''), the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two, but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible (regular) TB and drug-resistant TB. To determine drug susceptibility, the bacteria need to be grown and tested in a laboratory. Final diagnosis for TB, and especially for XDR TB, may take from 6 to 16 weeks. ' "
Is XDR TB a problem in the United States?,"'The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the United States appears to be relatively low. However, it is important to acknowledge the ease at which TB can spread. As long as XDR TB exists, the United States is at risk and must address the threat. ' "
How many cases of XDR TB have been reported in the United States?,"'In the United States, 49 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2006. ' "
Is it safe to travel where cases of XDR TB have been reported?,"'Although MDR and XDR TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. ''HIV''-infected ''travelers'' are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB.''All ''travelers'' should avoid high risk settings where there are no infection control measures in place. Documented places where transmission has occurred include crowded hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, and other settings where susceptible persons come in contact with persons with TB disease. ''Air travel itself carries a relatively low risk of infection with TB of any kind. ' "
What can health care providers do to prevent XDR TB?,"""Health care providers can help prevent MDR and XDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients' response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed. ""'Providers should also ensure proper implementation of infection control procedures to prevent exposure to TB in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen. ' "
Are immigrants putting the U.S. at increased risk for TB?,"'Persons applying to enter the U.S. with immigrant or refugee visas must complete a questionnaire about any symptoms of TB they may have and obtain a chest radiograph. If positive, the person submits sputum specimens for examination for TB bacteria. Persons identified as having infectious TB are not granted entry to the United States, until they have been treated. ' "
Why haven't we heard about XDR TB before now?,"'For some years we have seen isolated cases of very highly resistant TB around the world that we would today call XDR TB. The drugs used to treat TB have been around a long time and drug resistance has taken many years to develop. Over time, countries have improved their laboratory capacity to test for drug resistance and their ability to track the number of cases. All of these factors have contributed to an increase in reporting of cases of drug-resistant TB. With more cases being identified, the problem was more closely examined, defined, and given a name. ' "
What is CDC doing to prevent XDR TB from becoming a bigger problem?,"'CDC is collaborating with other federal agencies and international partners to raise awareness and enhance strategies for TB ''prevention'' worldwide by ''SOURCE: ''Centers for Disease Control & Prevention' Strengthening TB services for people living with HIV/AIDS Assembling outbreak

What is dry mouth?,"'Dry mouth'' is a condition that results from a decreased volume of saliva in the mouth. ''Dry mouth'' is also called xerostomia. Xerostomia can make it difficult to speak, eat, and digest food and can lead to malnutrition. Extreme dry mouth and salivary gland dysfunction can produce significant ''anxiety'"", permanent mouth, and throat disorders, and can impair a person's quality of life.""  "
How common is dry mouth?,'Dry mouth affects about 10% of all people and tends to be more prevalent in women than men. Disorders of saliva production affect elderly people and those who are taking prescription and nonprescription medications most frequently.' 
What are the benefits of saliva?,"'Saliva is an essential part of a healthy mouth and is often taken for granted. The lubricating properties of saliva provide comfort and help protect the oral tissues against ulcers, sores, and other frictional movements that accompany normal eating and speaking. Saliva neutralizes acids and helps defend against ''tooth decay'', and bacterial, viral, or fungal threats. Saliva helps digest food and helps ''teeth'"" in remineralization. Saliva is also a very essential contributor to a person's ability to taste, as it acts as a solvent for the taste stimuli. When saliva volume is insufficient, all of these functions are impaired."" "
What causes dry mouth?,"'There are many causes of dry mouth. Dry mouth most commonly occurs as a side effect of medications that cause decreased saliva production, including ''high blood pressure'' medications, ''antihistamines'', ''antidepressants'' (such as ''Wellbutrin'', ''Lexapro'' and ''Zoloft''), diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, steroids (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''), ''amphetamines'' (such as ''Adderall''), and many others. There are over 400 commonly used medications that can cause dry mouth. Sometimes the dry mouth goes away, but usually it continues as long as the medication is being used. Other causes of dry mouth include ''dehydration'', ''radiation'' treatments to treat cancerous tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland diseases, removal of salivary glands, ''diabetes'', ''smoking'', using ''chewing tobacco'', hormonal imbalances, ''sinusitis'', mouth ''breathing'', ''sleep apnea'', ''cystic fibrosis'', ''mumps'', ''hypothyroidism'"", and autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', and ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. ''Eating disorders'', such as ''bulimia'' and ''anorexia'', are other risk factors for developing xerostomia. Salivary production can be decreased if a major salivary duct becomes blocked, such as from a salivary stone or infection. Other risk factors include ''stress'', ''anxiety'', and ''depression''. '""Alzheimer's""' disease and '""Parkinson's""' disease often lead to ''dehydration'', making a person constantly at risk for dry mouth. These along with ''stroke'' can cause a perception of dry mouth even if salivary function is adequate, due to the diminished ability to perceive oral sensations.''Nerve damage or ''trauma'' to the head and neck can affect the nerves that provide sensation to the mouth and result in a feeling of dry mouth.''Shortness of breath'' may be caused by a ''panic attack'', or ''anxiety'', which can cause dry mouth. But shortness of breath may also be an indicator of serious respiratory or circulatory problems (such as a ''heart attack'').''Dry mouth often occurs in ''pregnancy'' or ''breastfeeding'' due to dehydration and hormonal changes and is often accompanied by ''nausea''.''Those undergoing treatment for obstructive ''sleep apnea'', including ''CPAP'', may experience dry mouth. This is typically due to any of the following:''Consultation with the physician managing the ''sleep'' apnea can be helpful.'   A mask leak Sleeping with an open mouth Non-humidified air"
What are dry mouth symptoms and signs?,"'People complaining of dry mouth may exhibit some or all of the following symptoms:''Fungal infections'"" occurring in an individual with dry mouth may be associated with another underlying disease or disorder such as Addison's disease, ""'HIV'', or ''diabetes''. The most common sign of fungal infection of the mouth is burning tongue or white or dark plaque on the tongue or soft tissues of the mouth. Frequently, a dry mouth may manifest mostly at night during sleeping, especially in mouth-breathers.' Dry feeling in mouth Dry feeling in throat, sore throat Frequent thirst Difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing (dysphagia) Increased need to drink liquids in order to swallow Diminished or altered sense of taste Chapped or cracked lips Hoarseness Dry eyes Pale gums Headaches, dizziness Bad breath Persistent cough Dry nasal passages Dry corners of mouth Nausea Mouth sores, ulcers Difficulty wearing dentures White tongue indicative of a fungal infection like yeast (candidiasis) Burning, sore, or tingling sensation in mouth, tongue, or throat Red, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and periodontitis Tooth decay -- especially around the gum line or on the root surfaces"
What specialists treat dry mouth?,"'The type of doctor who should treat dry mouth depends on the cause. A person noticing symptoms of dry mouth should first consult with their dentist for a consult and exam. A general dentist will do a review of medications, health history, lifestyle, ''diet'', and other things that could contribute to dry mouth. They will then perform an intraoral examination to confirm diminished salivary flow and to determine the effects it has had on the dentition and oral tissues. The management and maintenance of ''oral health'' will be the most important element of this relationship.''If it is determined that there is salivary gland dysfunction, the dentist may partner with an ENT physician who specializes in salivary gland disorders to help improve the condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose dry mouth?,"'When dry mouth is observed, the dentist can be helpful in determining the cause of dry mouth and obtaining a proper diagnosis. The diagnosis will help in developing a plan for management and treatment. The dentist will inspect the main salivary glands and ducts to check for blockages and may measure both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow. The lips, tongue, and oral tissues will all be inspected for dryness. Sometimes a patient will still complain of dry mouth even if salivary flow is adequate. Since the symptoms of dry mouth vary greatly from individual to individual, treatments vary. Sometimes treatments are given for prolonged, chronic complaint of dry mouth, even without clinical signs of changes within the mouth. The dentist can be an important resource for specific information to manage dry mouth.' "
What are home remedies and treatment options for dry mouth?,"'Those seeking treatment for dry mouth will most likely want something to provide comfort and relief. Most are ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) remedies. Treatment for dry mouth can be divided into the following four categories: saliva preservation, saliva substitution, saliva stimulation, and ''prevention'' of ''caries'', and yeast (''Candida'') infection.''Saliva preservation'': If salivary content is low, one must do as much as possible to keep the oral tissues as moist as possible and limit the things that can dry the mouth out. Those experiencing dry mouth should try to breathe through their nose as much as possible, and limit mouth breathing. Avoiding ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'"", and tobacco is very important. Using a humidifier to introduce more moisture to a room or at bedside can be helpful, especially while sleeping. Don't use OTC antihistamines or decongestants, as they can dry the mouth out as well.""'Saliva substitution'"": There are many home remedies to help replace the moisture that saliva provides to the mouth. These include drinking water more frequently throughout the day, especially while eating. Sucking ice chips throughout the day will help the mouth remain as moist as possible. A mouthwash can be helpful, but it can also be harmful. When selecting a mouthwash, the person must choose a product that doesn't contain alcohol, such as Biotene, for alcohol-based products will only cause further mouth dryness. Closys mouthwash can be extremely beneficial due to its absence of alcohol and excellent germ-killing properties. Artificial OTC saliva substitutes and oral lubricants containing ""'glycerin'"" will provide help during eating and speaking. They won't cure xerostomia, but will provide some relief. Moisturizing the lips with a balm or Vaseline can also be helpful.""'Saliva stimulation'': Chewing gum can help stimulate salivary flow, but it is important to remember not to use gum or candies that have ''sugar'' in them or the person will be placed at greater risk for developing ''cavities''. ''Sugar''-free lemon drops, lozenges, or other hard candies can also help stimulate the salivary glands. Other remedies include medications that help increase salivary flow such as ''pilocarpine'' (''Salagen'') and ''cevimeline'' (''Evoxac''). These prescription medications are to be avoided by people with ''asthma'' or ''glaucoma''.''Prevention of caries and ''Candida'' infection'': ''Cavities'', ''gingivitis'', periodontal disease, and fungal infections are common complications of dry mouth. A dry oral environment makes plaque control more difficult, so meticulous oral care and hygiene becomes essential in preventing rampant caries, ''gingivitis'', and periodontal disease. The affected individual should incorporate a low-sugar ''diet'' and begin daily use of fluoride treatments and antimicrobial rinses to combat the effects oral dryness has on the ''teeth'' and oral tissues. Prescription toothpastes that contain more fluoride, calcium, and phosphate will help protect and remineralize teeth where necessary. Frequent visits to the dentist are necessary to help manage these complications. Since people with dry mouth often develop fungal infections such as ''thrush'' (''oral candidiasis''), they may require topical antifungal treatment such as rinses and dissolving tablets. ''Dentures'' often harbor fungal infections, so they should be soaked daily in chlorhexidine or 1% bleach.'  "
Is it possible to prevent dry mouth?,"'There is really no prevention of dry mouth, only the side effects of dry mouth. It is vital to detect, diagnose, and treat xerostomia as early as possible to avoid the devastating consequences of chronic dry mouth on dental and overall health.' "
What is the prognosis of dry mouth?,"'The prognosis (outlook) depends on the underlying cause of the dry mouth. Management should be focused on eliminating the cause when possible, such as with dehydration, ''anemia'', and ''stress'"". If the cause can't be eliminated, then it is necessary to keep the affected person as comfortable and free from caries and ""'Candida'' ''yeast infection'' as possible. By using simple techniques to help stimulate saliva, substitute for saliva, and protect the teeth and surrounding tissues, one can expect a very good prognosis for avoiding the side effects of dry mouth.'
