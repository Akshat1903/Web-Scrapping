Questions,Answer
What is Naegleria fowleri?,"'Naegleria fowleri'' is a heat-loving, single-celled amoeba (also spelled amoeba) in the phylum of protozoa called Percolozoa. It is free-living, meaning that it normally lives in freshwater and soil, consuming organic matter and bacteria. The organism goes through three stages in its life cycle: ''cyst'', flagellate, and trophozoite. ''Cysts'' are highly stable in the environment and can withstand near-freezing temperatures. The flagellate form is an intermediate stage that moves about but does not consume nutrients or reproduce. The trophozoite form is the active, eating, reproducing phase. Animals and humans are ""accidental hosts."" PAM occurs only when an animal or human enters the environment at a time when amebae are actively reproducing and seeking food. ''Naegleria'' are ""thermophilic,"" meaning that they become active in warm water during summer months. They live in both tropical and temperate climates throughout the world. The organism is commonly found in any freshwater, including rivers, lakes, drainage ditches, ponds, or any other water exposed to soil. It is also common in hot springs (geothermal water) or in localized areas where warmer water is discharged into lakes. Where the water temperature is cool, ''Naegleria'' will encyst. The protective ''cyst'' form may be found in the sediment at the bottom of lakes, where it survives winters. The most infectious form is the trophozoite stage, but cysts may also become infectious within a few hours of detecting favorable conditions. The flagellated stage can become a trophozoite within minutes.''It has been found in poorly chlorinated and unchlorinated swimming pools, as well as water parks using non-chlorine-based water treatment methods. In 2016, a young woman contracted amebic meningoencephalitis after white water rafting at a popular artificial rafting park in North Carolina. The park did not use recommended chlorination as for swimming pools. Public health authorities found extremely high levels of ''Naegleria fowleri'' in the water.''Travelers'' outside the U.S. may also be exposed to ''Naegleria'' due to variances in water treatment. In 2013, an American boy was infected after swimming in an unchlorinated hotel pool in Costa Rica that was fed by a hot spring. In Pakistan, where many water supplies may not have consistent chlorination, several deaths from ''Naegleria'' infection occur every year, due to rinsing of the nose with tap water prior to prayer. In 2015, a young woman contracted ''Naegleria'' infection after visiting a popular water resort in Pakistan.''In recent years, ''Naegleria fowleri'' was discovered in public drinking water and plumbing in New Orleans. ''Naegleria'"" is resistant to low levels of chlorine, and chlorine dissipates the further treated water travels from a treatment plant. This was discovered after three fatal cases in which the only risk factors were flushing of sinuses with tap water and playing on a hose-fed Slip 'N Slide. ""'Naegleria'' was found in the hose, in drinking water, and hot water heaters in these cases. Australia has known of ''Naegleria'' in drinking water for 30 years, when the first cases of PAM were described related to public drinking water. Since then, Australia has maintained a water treatment system that eliminates it. Louisiana implemented the Australian model in 2013, which includes regular monitoring for ''Naegleria'' and chlorine and increasing chlorine for 60 days if the ameba is found. (This is called a ""chlorine ''burn''."")''While most cases of amebic meningoencephalitis in the U.S. have been reported in the southern-tier states, warming temperature trends have shifted cases north as far as Maryland and Minnesota in recent years.''Naegleria fowleri'' cannot live in saltwater and is not found in the ocean.''Although there are many species of ''Naegleria'', only ''Naegleria fowleri'' causes human and animal infection. There are other free-living amoebae that cause human disease, including ''Balamuthia mandrillaris'', various ''Acanthamoeba'' species, and ''Sappinia'' species.' "
What causes a Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'N. fowleri'' exposure occurs when warm fresh water is forced up the nose when swimming, diving, water skiing, playing with hose-fed water toys, or other recreational activity. Public drinking water and well water may also pose a risk. Although contact with infected water is common in the United States, symptomatic disease caused by ''N. fowleri'' is not often reported. ''Naegleria'' infection mainly affects the nervous system.''PAM occurs when ''N. fowleri'' is aspirated or forced high into the nasal ''cavity''. The ameba produces enzymes that digest ''mucus'' and protein, which it swallows up with its ""food cups"" or amoebastomes. ''N. fowleri'' is attracted to chemicals released by nerve cells. The olfactory nerves (nerves of smell) travel from the roof of the nasal ''cavity'' through openings in the skull (cribriform plate) into the base of the brain. The ameba consumes the nerve cells, migrating along these tracts until it reaches the brain. The brain is an especially rich food source, with high oxygen levels, glucose, and living cells. Damage to the brain is caused by severe inflammation, direct injury, and bleeding. Death is caused by the resulting severe swelling of the brain tissue.'  "
What are risk factors for Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'The source of nearly all of the ''Naegleria fowleri'' infections reported since 1962 in the U.S. has been exposure to untreated freshwater during the summer. Activities that pose a risk include submerging the head, jumping ''feet'' first, diving, and sports that pull a person behind a boat, like wakeboarding, tubing, and water skiing. Water sources include freshwater lakes, rivers, drainage ditches, and ponds. Other freshwater sources have included hot springs, poorly chlorinated swimming pools and water parks, untreated well water, water heaters, neti pots, hose water, and warm water discharge from power plants.''Cases have historically occurred in the South, primarily Florida and Texas. In recent years, cases have been reported as far north as Minnesota, Maryland, Lake Havasu City in Arizona, Los Angeles in California, and other sites. Climate change is thought to be playing a role in its spread.''Of the 37 cases reported from 2005 to 2015, 33 people acquired PAM from recreational exposure to freshwater, three from using a ''neti pot'"" with contaminated tap water, and one from playing on a hose-fed Slip 'N Slide toy. Most patients are young, healthy, and active, between 10-14 years of age. The full range of ages is 5-19.""'Neti pots are sinus irrigation systems that are designed to ''flush'' water deep into the nasal cavity. They are often successfully used by ''allergy'' and sinus sufferers. Many people are not aware that public drinking water is not tested for amebae and is only chlorinated enough to kill some ''diarrhea''-causing bacteria; drinking water is not sterile and contains a living ecosystem of bacteria, fungi, and amebae. These are usually harmless but occasionally are not. Higher levels of chlorine are needed to kill most infection-causing parasites like ameba and other protozoa. In addition, private water cisterns and water storage tanks may pose a risk.''In parts of the world where chlorination is poor, nasal rinsing may be used to purify the body before prayer -- an act called ritual ablution. In Pakistan, recent years have seen reports from 10-15 cases per year of PAM, and chlorination of drinking water or pools has been lax.''It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of invasive ''Naegleria fowleri'' infection compared to the many more probable exposures. It is easy to consider, however, that cases are missed because health professionals lack awareness, there is misdiagnosis or trouble making a diagnosis before death, or there is a lack of diagnosis because ''autopsy'"" is not routinely performed. Few medical situations require a legally mandatory autopsy by the medical examiner, and many facilities don't do them anymore. Autopsies are not covered by insurance and cost up to $5,000. Most death certificates are signed by a doctor based on a best guess. Underreporting may occur because there is no mandatory federal reporting, and states differ in the requirement to report diseases related to amebae.""'Other ameba have been transmitted by transplanted tissue, but ''Naegleria fowleri'' has not caused disease. Between 1995 and 2012, 21 organs have been transplanted from individuals who died from PAM; however, no cases of transplant-related PAM have been recorded, which is reassuring. The risk is not zero, because ''Naegleria'' can spread in the blood to other organs, probably when the blood-brain barrier has been destroyed.''Swallowing the ameba has not been associated with infection. Properly chlorinated and maintained recreational water systems or seawater have not been associated with infection.''Humidifiers or vaporizers do not pose a risk; droplets produced by these devices are very small and cannot carry an ameba or cyst without the organism drying out.' "
Is Naegleria fowleri infection contagious?,'PAM is not ''contagious'' from person to person. The only way to become infected with ''Naegleria fowleri'' is for the ameba to reach the tissues far up at the roof of the nasal cavity.' 
What are signs and symptoms of a Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'After exposure to a contaminated water source, symptoms of PAM develop within 2-12 days of exposure, usually within 1 week (incubation period). Initial symptoms may include disturbance of taste or smell, but this may not be noticed. Most cases begin with''As the illness progresses over several hours to a few days, most cases describe''The infection progresses so quickly that the disease may not be diagnosed until after death if an autopsy is performed. Most victims die within 2-4 days of first symptoms from severe inflammation and swelling of the brain.'   frontal headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, and stiffness of the neck (unable to touch the chin to the chest). seizures, confusion or loss of attention to surroundings, hallucinations, coma, and death."
What types of specialists treat Naegleria fowleri infections?,"'The first health professional a person with PAM sees may be a primary care provider such as a pediatrician, family medicine doctor, internal medicine doctor, or nurse practitioner, but most go to an emergency room when symptoms like ''headache and fever'' are severe or are not going away. People with suspected PAM are usually hospitalized under the care of a personal physician, a hospitalist, or a critical care doctor, and an infectious disease doctor often assists with evaluation and treatment decisions. A neurosurgeon (brain surgeon) may be consulted for intrathecal catheter placement and intracranial pressure monitoring.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'Naegleria fowleri'' should be quickly suspected in people with exposure to freshwater who have the symptoms of meningitis or meningoencephalitis listed above. The characteristics of the presentation may be nonspecific at first, leading clinicians to suspect more common diseases such as bacterial or viral meningitis. Routine tests may show a high blood white cell count, but brain scan may be normal. It is important not to delay a spinal tap if at all possible while waiting for a brain scan. If performed early, the spinal fluid may not suggest serious infection, and some victims were sent home from the emergency room, only to return with worsening disease. If suspicion is high, the spinal tap should be repeated in 8-12 hours. Spinal fluid reflects inflammation with elevated levels of white blood cells and ''red blood cells''. Routine Gram staining does not detect the ameba, however, it may be seen on the routine Wright-Giemsa stain that is performed for the cell count. A wet mount of fresh spinal fluid must be performed immediately to look for the moving amebae under the microscope. The ameba do not move unless the fluid is warmed. They will also move if a drop of distilled water is added to spinal fluid on the slide. This examination may be unsuccessful if there are many white blood cells due to intense inflammation; ameba and white blood cells appear very similar to most technicians who are not experienced in looking for ''Naegleria''.''The CDC Emergency Operations Center offers 24/7 assistance with diagnosis and should be consulted immediately at 770-488-7100.''Definitive tests for ''N. fowleri'' infection are done in only a few labs in the country, including the CDC. They use one of the following three methods:''The CDC PCR test is highly sensitive and specific for ''Naegleria fowleri'', meaning it picks up even small numbers of amebae and is rarely negative if the ameba is truly present.' N. fowleri nucleic acid tests in CSF or biopsy tissue using PCR N. fowleri antigen tests in CSF or biopsy tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) It is also possible to culture N. fowleri on a petri dish that is covered with a layer of bacteria. The culture is then observed for winding trails caused by the amebae consuming the bacteria. This is not routinely done."
What is the treatment for a Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'Because ''Naegleria'' meningoencephalitis is so uncommonly diagnosed and rapidly progresses to death, there are no studies comparing one treatment regimen to another. Performing comparative human studies would be unethical. This makes all uses of medications against ''N. fowleri'' ""off label."" Treatment is currently very intensive, and based on prior successful regimens, combinations of ''drugs'', and advances in managing traumatic brain injuries.''Amphotericin B is an intravenous (IV) drug usually used for ''fungal infections''. It is the drug of choice but often fails if given alone. In addition to intravenous treatment, amphotericin B can be instilled directly into the spinal fluid (intrathecally). Other antifungal drugs that have shown success include ''fluconazole'' or ''miconazole''; these may be given via IV and intrathecally. Antibiotics that kill ''Naegleria'' include ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'', AzaSite) and rifampin (''Rifadin'') and are given via IV, as well.''In 2016, miltefosine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of a parasitic infection, ''leishmaniasis'', and it is now commercially available. Profunda, INC, in Orlando, Florida, has made a treatment supply of miltefosine available to hospitals on a consignment basis. The hospitals can stock the drug on-site in the event it is needed to treat PAM; they are charged for the drug only if it is used, and the company will restock it when it expires.''In addition to antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory and other drugs are used to reduce brain swelling. Brain swelling may be relieved by insertion of a shunt tube (ventriculostomy) to drain excess spinal fluid. The body may be cooled to 93 F (''hypothermia''). The use of artificial ''respiration'' techniques such as ""''hyperventilation''"" and induced coma also help reduce swelling and protect brain function while the amebae are killed.''The most important advance in treatment is the availability of miltefosine in the U.S. This drug, which is highly active against amebae, was not available outside of Europe until the FDA approved its use by the CDC under an experimental treatment protocol. This made it possible to stock the drug at the CDC, from where it could be shipped within hours to a hospital. In 2013, miltefosine was used in two cases, and both patients survived. One recovered with minimal ''brain damage'' and was discharged home after 2 months hospitalization. The other (who was treated late into illness) suffered permanent disability. In 2016, a patient in Orlando survived with minimal residual problems after very rapid diagnosis and start of treatment that included miltefosine. Miltefosine has been provided in other cases without success; it is usually days into the infection.''It is strongly recommended that an infectious disease doctor and the CDC Emergency Operations Center be consulted immediately to guide therapy. The CDC Emergency Operations Center is available 24/7 at 770-488-7100.' "
Is it possible to prevent Naegleria fowleri infections?,"'PAM is preventable. The risk can be eliminated by avoiding untreated freshwater recreation during hot periods of the year. Consistent use of nose clips is probably next best, by keeping freshwater out of the nose. Avoidance of jumping, diving, and submerging the head are basic precautions. While it is recommended to avoid stirring up the bottom of lakes, ameba are present at all levels in the water column where water temperatures are between 76 F-115 F. This makes warm surface water in the middle of a lake a risk, as well as the shore.''While common sense suggests that signs will be posted if there is a risk, this is rarely the case, and safety is in the hands of the swimmer. Most untreated freshwater is not tested for microbes. Recreational lakes and rivers with beaches may be tested for bacteria that cause diarrheal illness but rarely for amebae. Even testing of such waters is not reassuring, because it may be found one week and not the next. The CDC recommends that all swimmers assume there is a low risk of amoebic meningitis at all times in untreated freshwater during hot months and take precautions to keep water out of the nose.''It is not possible to eliminate the ameba from untreated freshwater since, like fish, it is simply a part of the life cycle. Chlorination to a level of 1 part per million (ppm) of free chlorine is needed to eliminate amebae and other waterborne pathogens from pools; 3 ppm is recommended for hot tubs.''In addition to untreated freshwater, chlorine levels may be low in plumbing systems the further they are from a treatment plant. Chlorine also may dissipate in unused water pipes in a home; hot water heaters are excellent incubators at temperatures under 120 F. Hot water heaters should be kept at minimum 120 F (higher may pose a scalding risk to children and the elderly). All the faucets should be run regularly with very hot water. Children should be taught not to suck water up the nose in the tub or shower. Outdoor hoses should not be used for drinking as they are contaminated and may force water up the nose by accident. If a filter is attached to the end of a hose used to fill kiddie pools or water toys, it should be labeled as NSF-certified to filter ""cysts,"" or filter particles down to 1 micron. Care should be taken to clean and dry water play items in between uses and keep them away from dirt.''Those who flush their sinuses or nose should never use water straight from the faucet to prepare irrigation solution. The water should be boiled for at least 1 minute (longer at higher altitudes above sea level) and then allowed to cool. It can be used for a day or so. Purified or distilled water may also be purchased for this use.''Public swimming pools may not always be well maintained, especially during heavy use or traveling, but anyone can use standard pool test strips to check the chlorine and pH of a public facility before going in. People can empower themselves and get free pool test strips at HealthyPools.org (''https://waterandhealth.org/healthy-pools/pool-test-kit-chlorine-ph-strips/'').' "
What is the prognosis of a Naegleria fowleri infection?,"'The prognosis for infected patients is very poor, as 99% of infections are fatal despite intensive treatment. The rare survivor may have residual neurological problems, such as ''seizure disorders''.''There is reason for hope, however, if treatment is started immediately with a regimen that includes miltefosine. At least two cases in recent years were cured with rapid diagnosis and prompt, intensive therapy that included miltefosine. Both have had little residual problems. This is the best reason for providers and the public to be aware of the risk factors and make the diagnosis quickly. Otherwise, the easiest and cheapest treatment is prevention.' "
Where can people find additional information about Naegleria fowleri infections?,'The CDC is the most thorough and evidence-based source of information on ''Naegleria fowleri'' and other free-living amoebae: ''http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/general.html''.' 
What is fatty liver disease? What is nonalcoholic liver disease (NASH)?,"'Fatty liver is a condition in which the cells of the liver accumulate abnormally increased amounts of fat. Although excessive consumption of ''alcohol'' is a very common cause of fatty liver (alcoholic fatty liver), there is another form of fatty liver, termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), in which alcohol has been excluded as a cause. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, other recognized causes of fatty liver that are less common causes than alcohol also are excluded.''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a manifestation of an abnormality of metabolism within the liver. The liver is an important organ in the metabolism (handling) of fat. The liver makes and exports fat to other parts of the body. It also removes fat from the blood that has been released by other tissues in the body, for example, by fat cells, or absorbed from the food we eat. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the handling of fat by liver cells is disturbed. Increased amounts of fat are removed from the blood and/or are produced by liver cells, and not enough is disposed of or exported by the cells. As a result, fat accumulates in the liver.''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is classified as either fatty liver (sometimes referred to as isolated fatty liver or IFL) or steatohepatitis (NASH). In both isolated fatty liver and NASH there is an abnormal amount of fat in the liver cells, but, in addition, in NASH there is inflammation within the liver, and, as a result, the liver cells are damaged, they die, and are replaced by ''scar tissue''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fatty liver disease?,"'Fatty liver disease rarely causes symptoms until the liver disease is far advanced. Doctors usually find or suspect fatty liver when ''abnormal liver tests'' appear in routine blood testing, fat is seen in the liver when ''ultrasonography'' of the abdomen is performed for other reasons, for example, the diagnosis of ''gallstones'', and infrequently when the liver is enlarged on physical examination of a patient.''When the liver disease is far advanced (cirrhosis), signs and symptoms of cirrhosis predominate. These include:'   Excessive bleeding due to the inability of the liver to make blood-clotting proteins Jaundice due to the inability of the liver to eliminate bilirubin from the blood Gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension that increases the pressure in intestinal blood vessels Fluid accumulation due to portal hypertension that causes fluid to leak from blood vessels and the inability of the liver to make the major blood protein, albumin Mental changes (encephalopathy) due to the liver's inability to eliminate chemicals from the body that are toxic to the brain. Coma may occur. Liver cancer"
What causes NASH?,"'The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is complex and not completely understood. ''The most important factors appear to be the presence of obesity and ''diabetes''.'' It used to be thought that obesity was nothing more than the simple accumulation of fat in the body. Fat tissues were thought to be inert, that is, they served as simply storage sites for fat and had little activity or interactions with other tissues. We now know that fat tissue is very active metabolically and has interactions and effects on tissues throughout the body.''When large amounts of fat are present as they are in obesity, the fat becomes metabolically active (actually inflamed) and gives rise to the production of many hormones and proteins that are released into the blood and have effects on cells throughout the body. One of the many effects of these hormones and proteins is to promote ''insulin resistance'' in cells.''Insulin'' resistance is a state in which the cells of the body do not respond adequately to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin is important because it is a major promoter of glucose (''sugar'') uptake from the blood by cells. At first, the pancreas compensates for the insensitivity to insulin by making and releasing more insulin, but eventually it can no longer produce sufficient quantities of insulin and, in fact, may begin to produce decreasing amounts. At this point, not enough ''sugar'' enters cells, and it begins to accumulate in the blood, a state known as diabetes. Although sugar in the blood is present in large amounts, the insensitivity to insulin prevents the cells from receiving enough sugar. Since sugar is an important source of energy for cells and allows them to carry out their specialized functions, the lack of sugar begins to alter the way in which the cells function.''In addition to releasing hormones and proteins, the fat cells also begin to release some of the fat that is being stored in them in the form of fatty acids. As a result, there is an increase in the blood levels of fatty acids. This is important because large amounts of certain types of fatty acids are toxic to cells.''The release of hormones, proteins, and fatty acids from fat cells affects cells throughout the body in different ways. Liver cells, like many other cells in the body, become insulin resistant, and their metabolic processes, including their handling of fat, become altered. The liver cells increase their uptake of fatty acids from the blood where fatty acids are in abundance. Within the liver cells, the fatty acids are changed into storage fat, and the fat accumulates. At the same time, the ability of the liver to dispose of or export the accumulated fat is reduced. In addition, the liver itself continues to produce fat and to receive fat from the ''diet''. The result is that fat accumulates to an even greater extent.'  "
Can obesity and diabetes cause NASH?,"'Obesity and diabetes have important roles in the development of fatty liver. Whereas one third of the general population (which includes obese and people with diabetes) may develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, more than two thirds of people with diabetes develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Among patients who are very obese and undergoing surgery for their obesity, the majority have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, whereas the risk of NASH is less than 5% among lean persons, the risk is more than a third among the obese. Fatty liver increases both in prevalence as well as severity as the degree of obesity increases. The increases begin at weights that are considered ''overweight'' - i.e., less than obese.' "
Can metabolic syndrome cause NASH?,"'Metabolic syndrome is a syndrome defined by the association of several metabolic abnormalities that are believed to have a common cause. These metabolic abnormalities result in obesity, elevated blood ''triglycerides'', low density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"" ''cholesterol'') and high density lipoprotein (''HDL'') cholesterol, ''high blood pressure'', and elevated blood sugar (diabetes).''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a manifestation of metabolic syndrome and thus occurs frequently with the other manifestations of the syndrome. Occasionally, it may occur without the other abnormalities of the syndrome.' "
Can alcohol or drug abuse cause NASH?,"'Several identifiable causes of fatty liver that are not nonalcoholic fatty liver disease so often causes ''confusion''. The most common causes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are excessive alcohol consumption and ''hepatitis C'"". Other causes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease include Wilson's disease, ""'lipodystrophy'' (a disease of fat storage), starvation, intravenous ''nutrition'', and abetalipoproteinemia (a disease of fat transport).''Several drugs also cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, for example cortilcosteroids, ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'').' "
Can NASH occur in children?,"'Since the current epidemic of obesity begins in childhood, it is not surprising to find that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurs in children. Only a few studies are available, but the estimated prevalence among children 2-19 years of age is approximately 10%, the prevalence increases with the degree of obesity, and there is progression to cirrhosis. Although there is concern about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among children, there is not enough evidence of benefit of treatment, and, therefore, no general recommendation has been made to screen overweight and obese children for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is recommended, however, that children with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in whom the diagnosis is not clear should have a liver biopsy. Children should not be started on any drug treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without a biopsy showing NASH. Although there have not been studies in children to support the recommendations, loss of weight and ''exercise'' are the recommended treatment for children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.' "
Is fatty liver disease serious?,"'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is important for several reasons, ''it is a common disease, and is increasing in prevalence, NASH is an important cause of serious liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and the complications of cirrhosis - liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver ''cancer''. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with other very common and serious non-liver diseases, perhaps the most important being cardiovascular disease that leads to ''heart disease'' and ''strokes''. Fatty liver probably is not the cause of these other diseases, but is a manifestation of an underlying cause that the diseases share. Fatty liver, therefore, is a clue to the presence of these other serious medical conditions, which need to be addressed.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose NASH?,"'Fatty liver generally does not cause symptoms or signs, and any symptoms and signs are more likely to be due to the accompanying diseases such as obesity, diabetes, ''vascular disease'', etc. In anyone with obesity or diabetes, fatty liver should be suspected. In a minority of patients, abnormal ''liver tests'' are found on routine blood testing although the abnormalities usually are mild. Probably the most common method by which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is diagnosed is by imaging studies like ultrasonography, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''); that are obtained for reasons other than diagnosing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease also may be discovered when patients develop complications of the liver disease - cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer - due to the presence of NASH.''It is not possible to distinguish between isolated fatty liver and NASH with imaging studies. Although a combination of several blood tests has been suggested as a means of separating the two, and tests are being developed to identify NASH, biopsy of the liver is the best means to differentiate between the presence of fat, or fat and inflammation (NASH). Although the majority of individuals will have isolated fatty liver and not NASH, it is important to identify patients with NASH, because of the need to look for complications of liver disease and to enter these patients into trials of treatment with the hope of preventing progression of the liver disease. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes are good candidates to undergo biopsy of the liver since the incidence of NASH is higher among these groups.''One of the difficulties in diagnosing NASH as the cause of severe scaring or cirrhosis is that as the scaring progresses to cirrhosis, the fat disappears. This results in a condition that is referred to as ''cryptogenic cirrhosis'', cirrhosis in which there is no clear cause. (Specifically, in cryptogenic cirrhosis the two most common causes of cirrhosis - alcohol and ''viral hepatitis'' - are not involved.) Cryptogenic cirrhosis has puzzled physicians for many years as to its cause. However, it now appears that half of cryptogenic cirrhosis occurs in patients with obesity and/or diabetes and probably is due to NASH.' "
What is the treatment for NASH?,"'Treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease includes lifestyle changes (exercise, ''weight loss'', diet), medications, ''supplements'' and antioxidantsOmega-3 fatty acids, surgery, and liver transplantation.' "
Which foods and supplements should be avoided? Can you drink alcohol?,"'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been associated in human or animal studies with reduced amounts of unsaturated ''fats'' (a diet high in saturated fat) and increased amounts of fructose (which is most commonly added to the diet as high-fructose ''corn'' syrup). Benefits of increasing unsaturated fat (a diet lower in saturated fat, and higher unsaturated fat) and reducing high fructose ''corn'' syrup on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have not been demonstrated; however, there is little harm in doing so, especially since there may be benefits of these dietary modifications unrelated to the liver.''An interesting observation - though unexplained - is that there is less scarring (fibrosis) in the livers of patients with NASH who drink more than two cups of coffee per day. (Scarring or fibrosis is the process that ultimately leads to cirrhosis.) Similar benefits of coffee have been associated with lesser degrees of liver disease in both alcoholic cirrhosis and ''hepatitis C''. It is not unreasonable to recommend drinking coffee in moderate amounts in view of the lack of harmful side effects.''Vitamin D deficiency'' is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Although there is no reason to think that this deficiency contributes to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it is reasonable to measure ''vitamin D'' levels in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and treat them with ''vitamin D'' if they are deficient.''There is no evidence of harmful effects of light alcohol consumption (two or fewer ''drinks'' per day for men, one or fewer for women) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease though there also is no evidence that it is safe. Everyone, including individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol.'  "
Weight loss and exercise for NASH,"'Since the serious complications of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are primarily seen in patients with NASH, treatment of NASH is of great importance. Unfortunately, there are no clearly effective treatments for these patients. One of the difficulties in identifying effective treatments is the need for long-term studies since the progression of NASH to cirrhosis and its complications occurs slowly. Several treatments have resulted in a reduction of fat in the liver, but few have shown that the progression of NASH is slowed.''Weight loss'' and exercise are among the most promising of treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It does not take large amounts of weight loss to result in a decrease in liver fat. A less than 10% decrease in weight may be enough. Vigorous exercise results in a reduction of liver fat and may reduce the inflammation of NASH. The long-term effects of weight loss and exercise on the important development of cirrhosis and its complications are unknown. Nevertheless, now, the best theoretical approach to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is weight loss and vigorous exercise. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients are able to accomplish these.' "
Medications and other treatment options,"'There are no drugs that are approved for the treatment of fatty liver or NASH.''Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is a drug used for treating diabetes. It works by increasing the insulin sensitivity of cells, directly counteracting the insulin resistance that accompanies nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as the metabolic syndrome. It has been studied but, unfortunately, has not been found clearly to improve the liver injury associated with NASH.''''Pioglitazone'' (''Actos'') and ''rosiglitazone'' (''Avandia'') are drugs that treat diabetes because they increase insulin sensitivity. They are most used among patients with diabetes for control of their diabetes. There has been a reduction in liver fat and signs of liver injury with both drugs, and pioglitazone might reduce the scarring that results from the inflammation of NASH. Two problems that occur with treatment are ''weight gain'' and, with rosiglitazone, an increase in ''heart attacks''. Pioglitazone may be used to treat NASH; however, it needs to be recognized that its long-term effectiveness and safety have not been well-established.''Vitamin E'' has been studied in NASH because of its general effects of opposing inflammation. It has been shown to reduce liver fat and inflammation and possibly fibrosis, but its long-term effectiveness and safety have not been well-studied. Moreover, treatment of patients with vitamin E who do not have NASH is associated with a higher mortality and ''prostate cancer''. Vitamin E can be used for treating NASH, but it should be used selectively (not in all patients), and patients should understand the potential risks.''Pentoxifylline'' (''Trental'') has been studied for the treatment of NASH in small groups of patients with encouraging results; however, there is not enough experience or knowledge of its effectiveness and safety to recommend treatment outside of research studies.''Small studies have shown some benefit with ''omega-3''-fatty acids in reducing liver fat in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and larger studies are underway. In large groups of individuals (not selected because of the presence or absence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), omega-3-fatty acids were shown to reduce cardiovascular events such as ''heart attacks'' and overall mortality. Therefore, omega-3-fatty acids may be appropriate treatment for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the metabolic syndrome because these patients have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and death.''Lipid''-lowering drugs, specifically the ''statins'' and ''ezetimibe'' (''Zetia''), have been used to treat the abnormal blood ''lipids'' associated with the metabolic syndrome. Although there is evidence of beneficial effects of these drugs on the liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, there is not enough experience to recommend them in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease unless they are primarily being used for treating abnormal blood lipids.''Ursodeoxycholic acid (''Ursodiol'') has been studied in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease but has been abandoned because of its ineffectiveness and concerns about toxicity at very high doses.'  "
Bariatric surgery,"'Bariatric surgery is surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that results in loss of weight, and there are several different types of bariatric surgery. Since obesity is believed to be an important factor in the causation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and loss of weight has been shown to have beneficial effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery has been considered as a potential treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Only one study has reported the effects of bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and has demonstrated that fat and inflammation decrease, and progression from mild fibrosis to more severe fibrosis is arrested. (Patients with more severe fibrosis were not studied and, therefore it is not known if the progression from more severe fibrosis also is arrested.) Nevertheless, because appropriate studies to determine both the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery have not been done, it is recommended that bariatric surgery should not be used as a treatment for NASH. Instead, patients should be selected for surgery irrespective of the presence or absence of NASH.' "
Liver transplantation,"'Once a liver has become cirrhotic and complications have developed, the options for treatment are either treating the complications as they arise or to replace the diseased liver with a transplanted liver. In fact, NASH has become the third most common cause of transplanting livers, only surpassed by alcoholic liver disease and ''hepatitis C'', but it is expected to climb to the number one position due to the epidemic of obesity and diabetes that is occurring in the U.S. Unfortunately, NASH recurs frequently in the transplanted liver and then progresses to cirrhosis, presumably because the underlying causes - obesity and diabetes continue.' "
What are the complications of NASH?,"'The complications of nonalcoholic liver disease are essentially those of NASH that has progressed to cirrhosis and include liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver cancer.' "
What diseases are associated with NASH?,"'The diseases of the metabolic syndrome that are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have already been discussed. Other associations exist including fatty pancreas, ''hypothyroidism'', ''colon polyps'', elevated blood uric acid, ''vitamin D'' deficiency, polycystic ovary disease (PCOD), and obstructive ''sleep apnea''.''For example, half of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have obstructive ''sleep apnea'', and most patients with obstructive ''sleep'' apnea have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Associations do not prove causation, and in most cases, it is not clear why the associations exist--whether the associations are due to a causal relationship or they reflect an underlying common cause.' "
What is the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and heart disease?,"'Cardiovascular disease, especially ''heart attacks'' and strokes, is commonly seen in patients with fatty liver. In fact, cardiovascular ''causes of death'' occur more frequently than liver-related deaths. Whereas the components of the metabolic syndrome are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been found to be a risk factor that is independent of the metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk two-fold. Since the means of treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are limited, it is important that the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome - obesity, diabetes, ''high blood pressure'', dyslipidemia (abnormalities of fats or lipids in the blood) be aggressively treated.' "
What is the difference between nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis (NASH)?,"'As discussed previously, the difference between isolated, nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis (NASH) is the presence of inflammation and damage to the liver cells in NASH; in both, the liver has increased amounts of fat. Although about a third of the general population has fatty liver, approximately 10% have NASH. Approximately one third of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have NASH. Although fatty liver and NASH appear to arise under the same conditions, it does not appear that fatty liver progresses to NASH. Thus, whether a patient is to develop fatty liver versus NASH is determined very early during the accumulation of fat, although it is unclear what factors determine this. It is believed that the inflammation and damage of liver cells are caused by the toxic effects of the fatty acids released by fat cells, but fatty acids in the blood are elevated in both fatty liver and NASH. Perhaps the difference is explained by genetic susceptibility as suggested by preliminary data.''The consequences of fat in the liver depend greatly on the presence or absence of inflammation and damage in the liver, i.e., whether there is fat alone or NASH is present. Isolated fatty liver does not progress to important liver disease. NASH, on the other hand, can progress through the formation of ''scar'' (fibrous tissue) to cirrhosis. The complications of cirrhosis, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding, liver failure, and liver cancer, then may occur.' "
Facts you should know about narcissistic personality disorder," Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental disorder that is characterized by an established pattern of being fixated on oneself, permeating the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the sufferer, and their relationships with other people. People with NPD tend to alternate between feeling omnipotent and devalued. Narcissistic personality disorder occurs as often as in 6% of adults, more often in men than in women. Like most mental illness, narcissistic personality disorder tends to have biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to its development. Narcissists demonstrate a pervasive pattern of the external appearance of having significantly inflated self-esteem, a need for admiration, and lack of empathy for others that begins by early adulthood and manifests in a number of different aspects of their life. While the primary treatment for narcissistic personality disorder is talk therapy rather than medication, medication may be appropriate to address some co-occurring symptoms. One of the major obstacles to a good prognosis for narcissistic individuals is their perception that other people are the cause of their problems rather than their own self-centered tendencies."
What is narcissistic personality disorder?,"'In order to understand narcissistic personality disorder, the concept of personality is important. As with normal personality, that of the person with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has a pervasive way of thinking, feeling, and interacting with other people that tends to be fairly established and fixed by the time the individual reaches adulthood. A narcissist is someone who has therefore established a long-standing pattern of being fixated on him- or herself that permeates their thoughts, feelings, actions, and relationships.''The word ''narcissism'' comes from the story of Narcissus, a ''hunter'' in Greek mythology well known for his ''beauty'' and for being completely in love with himself. His all-consuming self-love resulted in his eventual death, caused by his becoming so attracted to his own reflection in a pool that he was unable to stop staring at his image.''People with narcissism tend to interact with others and the world in general by distorting things such that they alternate between feeling omnipotent or devalued. Children of a narcissistic parent often feel like they are never good enough. Narcissistic personality disorder has an average occurrence rate of about 1% of the population occurs as often as in 6% of adults. Some research indicates that the incidence of NPD more than doubled from 1999 to 2009.''Medical professionals diagnose NPD more often in men than in women. It is also more often found in people who are involved with the court system compared to the public. ''Antisocial personality disorder'' is an illness that commonly co-occurs with narcissistic personality disorder.' "
What are causes and risk factors for narcissistic personality disorder?,"'As with most ''mental health'' disorders, narcissistic personality disorder does not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with this illness tend to have biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to its development. Biologically, narcissists have a tendency to have a smaller part of the brain that is related to having empathy for others.''Psychologically, individuals with narcissism tend to have trouble having opposing self-images of excessive admiration and devaluing in their minds and in their relationships. They are excessively emotionally sensitive.''Early psychoanalytic theory on the emotional motivations for the development of NPD focused on the relationship between mothers and sons. Specifically, medical professionals believed that men develop this disorder as the result of having an excessively close relationship with their mother that is contingent upon always doing what she wants, with a resulting paranoid fear of retaliation by their father and humiliation or abandonment by their mother. Since those early theories, the social risk factors for developing NPD have been expanded to include excessive admiration or neglect by either parent.''In addition to receiving excessive, unrealistic admiration, praise, and overindulgence, or excessive criticism for misbehavior during childhood, theories about other social risk factors of narcissistic personality disorder include emotional abuse, unpredictable parental care and parent-child interactions, as well as learning manipulation from caregivers.'  "
What are narcissistic personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'In order to be assessed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, an individual must demonstrate a pervasive pattern of significantly inflated self-esteem (grandiosity), a need to be admired and lack of empathy for others that begins by early adulthood and is present in a number of different aspects of their life. According to the ''DSM-5''/''DSM-V'' (the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition''), the diagnostic reference that is written and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association, specific symptoms and signs of this illness have remained consistent from the previous edition (''DSM-IV-Text Revision'') and include the following:''Mental health professionals describe individuals who have some ''symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder'' but not enough for the full-blown diagnosis as having narcissistic personality traits.'   An excessive sense of self-importance, with an expectation of being seen as superior for no reason Preoccupation with self-aggrandizing fantasies: unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or love Excessive belief that he or she is special or unique and therefore should only associate with other high-status people A need for excessive admiration A sense of entitlement to receiving especially favorable treatment or compliance with their wishes A tendency to take advantage of others to achieve their own ends Lacking empathy for the needs and feelings of people Frequently envious of others or thinking others are envious of him or her Exhibits haughty, arrogant thoughts or behaviors"
How do medical professionals diagnose narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Many providers of health care may help make the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, including pediatricians, primary care providers, licensed mental health therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants and social workers. As part of this examination, the sufferer will likely undergo a full physical examination and laboratory tests in an attempt to rule out any medical condition that may contribute to the symptoms described. The person with NPD may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of the illness. Given the low level of insight that narcissistic individuals have regarding their symptoms, there is a lower tendency for them to self-report symptoms. Therefore, mental health professionals may seek information from the family members as part of the assessment of people with NPD. A medical professional will conduct a thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental health symptoms such that narcissistic personality disorder can be distinguished from other personality traits or disorders like histrionic personality disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''antisocial personality disorder''. The mental health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present, since narcissism is often also associated with ''depression'"" or perfectionism. In addition to demonstrating a pattern of grandiose thoughts or behaviors, self-absorption, need for admiration, and lack of empathy for others characterized by at least five of the previously described symptoms, other diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder include the sufferer's pattern of such behaviors being pervasive throughout the person's life, as well as stable, longstanding symptoms that are not better explained by another mental illness, the effects of a substance, or a medical condition."" "
What is the treatment for narcissistic personality disorder?,"'The primary treatment for narcissistic personality disorder is talk therapy (''psychotherapy'') rather than medication. However, medication may be appropriate to address some co-occurring mental health symptoms like ''depression'', irritability, or ''anxiety'"". Psychotherapy tends to focus on how the person with the disorder interacts with the therapist during therapy, examining and changing the individual's grandiose sense of self and excessively vulnerable thinking, teaching the sufferer ways to regulate their emotions, and correcting self-centered behaviors to more healthy self-confidence and prosocial ways of interacting with others. Some studies indicate that limited reparenting of the person with NPD by the therapist may help decrease the symptoms of the disorder. That approach, referred to as schema-focused therapy, involves accessing the aspects of the person consistent with a vulnerable child then helping the person emotionally mature to thinking and behaving like a mature adult.""'Providing family members of people with pathological narcissism with therapy that teaches them about the illness of their loved one as well as ways to improve their communication and problem-solving skills helps decrease symptoms in their narcissistic loved one.'  "
What are possible complications of narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Compared to people without mental illness, people with narcissistic personality disorder are at higher risk of becoming ''depressed'', anxious, and socially isolated. They tend to have problematic relationships, as well. They are also more prone to developing cardiovascular illnesses, abusing substances, becoming aggressive, and having ''suicidal thoughts'' on a long-term basis.' "
What is the prognosis of narcissistic personality disorder?,"""How well or poorly people with narcissistic personality disorder progress over time seems to be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the person receives appropriate treatment. Simultaneously suffering from other mental health problems, like ""'major depression'', ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', or another personality disorder, is associated with a lower likelihood of symptoms of NPD being alleviated with treatment. One of the major obstacles to treatment and therefore to a good prognosis for narcissistic individuals is the perception by these individuals that their problems are caused by others rather than by their own self-centered tendencies.' "
Is it possible to prevent narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like ''prevention'' of ''child abuse'', ''domestic violence'', and ''substance abuse'' in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems, including narcissistic personality disorder.'

What is narcolepsy?,"'Narcolepsy is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is the main symptom and is present in 100% of patients with narcolepsy. Other primary symptoms of narcolepsy include:''Additional symptoms include disturbed nocturnal sleep and automatic behavior (patients carry out certain actions without conscious awareness). A 2014 study in the ''Journal of Sleep Medicine'' also reported that ''nightmares'' may be more prevalent in people with narcolepsy than in the general population. All the symptoms of narcolepsy may be present in various combinations and degrees of severity.''Narcolepsy usually begins in teenagers or young adults and affects both sexes equally. The first symptom of narcolepsy to appear is excessive daytime sleepiness, which may remain unrecognized for a long time in that it develops gradually over time. The other symptoms can follow excessive daytime sleepiness by months or years. Cataplexy may appear before symptoms of narcolepsy.' loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), distorted perceptions (hypnagogic hallucinations), and inability to move or talk (sleep paralysis)."
What are the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy?,"'Signs and symptoms of narcolepsy include:''Other signs and symptoms include:''Disturbed nocturnal sleep with frequent awakenings and increased body movements may develop after the onset of the primary symptoms of narcolepsy. This additional symptom, along with excessive daytime sleepiness and the REM related abnormalities (cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis), from the so-called ""narcolepsy pentad"" (a set of five symptoms).''Automatic behavior may occur in 60% to 80% of patients with narcolepsy. Automatic behavior is when patients carry out certain actions without conscious awareness, often with the unusual use of words (irrelevant words, lapses in speech). This behavior occurs while the patient is fluctuating between sleep and wakefulness.''Other complaints associated with narcolepsy may include eye disturbances due to sleepiness, such as blurred vision, ''double vision'', and droopy eyelids.' Excessive daytime sleepiness Cataplexy Hypnagogic hallucinations Sleep paralysis Disturbed nocturnal sleep Automatic behavior Other complaints such as blurred vision, double vision, or droopy eyelids"
Narcolepsy with cataplexy symptoms,"'Cataplexy is a sudden, temporary loss of muscle control in a person with narcolepsy. An attack of cataplexy usually is triggered by strong emotional reactions such as laughter, excitement, surprise, or anger. Factors that contribute to the attacks of cataplexy include physical ''fatigue'', ''stress'', and sleepiness.''Severe attacks of cataplexy may result in a complete physical collapse with a fall to the ground and risk of injury. Milder forms of cataplexy are more common. These involve regional muscle groups and result in symptoms such as a drooping head, sagging jaw, slurred speech, buckling of the knees, or ''weakness'' in the arms. This muscle weakness can be quite subtle. The patient is conscious but usually unable to speak.''Cataplectic attacks may last from a few seconds to several minutes. They may vary from a few per year to numerous attacks per day that could disable the patient. Cataplexy is present in nearly 75% of patients with narcolepsy, according to the National Institutes of Health. The onset of cataplexy may coincide with the onset of excessive daytime sleepiness, but cataplexy often develops years later, so the absence of cataplexy should not rule out the diagnosis of narcolepsy.''Other symptoms may seem unrelated, but may accompany cataplexy. A study in the ''American Academy of Sleep Medicine'' also found that nearly one-quarter of patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy reported binge eating at least twice a week.'  "
Hypnagogic hallucinations and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) symptoms,"'Hypnagogic hallucinations may be present in up to 50% of patients with narcolepsy. Hypnagogic hallucinations are dream-like experiences that occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, whereas hypnopompic hallucinations occur during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. These hallucinations may involve ''hearing'"", vision, touch, balance, or movement. They often incorporate images of the patient's environment into the dream-like images. The hallucinations are frequently vivid, bizarre, frightening, and disturbing for the patients. As a result, the patients may become fearful that they have or will develop a ""'mental illness''.''The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), causes the patient to tend to fall asleep easily. This can happen in relaxed situations and also at inappropriate times and places. Patients may fall asleep while watching TV, reading a book, driving, attending a meeting, or engaging in a conversation. The daytime sleepiness is present even after normal nighttime sleep. Patients may describe this symptom as being tired, fatigued, sleepy, feeling lazy, or having low energy.'""Excessive daytime sleepiness is present throughout the day but the patient, with extreme effort, may be able to resist the sleepiness for some time. Finally, it becomes overwhelming and results in a sleep episode of varied duration (seconds to minutes). In addition to daytime sleepiness, repetitive, irresistible, and unintentional, sudden attacks of sleep may occur throughout the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness usually impairs a patient's functioning because it reduces motivation and vigilance, interferes with concentration and memory, and increases irritability.""  "
Sleep paralysis symptoms,"'Sleep paralysis may be present in up to 50% of patients with narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or talk that occurs during sleep-to- wake or wake-to-sleep transitions. It may feel like muscle paralysis, but it is not the same thing. Episodes of sleep paralysis may last seconds to minutes. They can occur at the same time as hypnagogic (or hypnopompic) hallucinations. During sleep paralysis, ''breathing'' is maintained, although some patients may experience a frightening sensation of not being able to breathe.''Cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis in patients with narcolepsy are referred to as ''REM related abnormalities'' because they are caused by ''REM sleep'' intrusions into wakefulness. (See the discussion of REM sleep in the section on sleep laboratory tests below.)' "
What causes narcolepsy?,"'Advances have been made in the last few years in determining the cause of narcolepsy. The newest discovery has been the finding of abnormalities in the structure and function of a particular group of nerve cells, called hypocretin neurons, in the brains of patients with narcolepsy. These cells are located in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and they normally secrete neurotransmitter substances (chemicals released by nerve cells to transmit messages to other cells) called hypocretins.''Abnormalities in the hypocretin system may be responsible for the daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep found in narcolepsy. (See the section below on sleep laboratory tests for a discussion of REM sleep.)''Experiments in ''dogs'' and mice with narcolepsy suggest an abnormal hypocretin system as a cause for the development of their narcolepsy. People with narcolepsy have been found to have a markedly decreased number of hypocretin nerve cells in the brain. They also have a decreased level of hypocretins in the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord).'""Narcolepsy is associated with a specific type of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). HLAs are genetically determined proteins on the surface of white blood cells. They are a part of the body's immune (defense) system. The finding of a very high HLA- association in narcolepsy led to the proposal that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease, similar to other HLA-associated diseases such as ""'multiple sclerosis'' and ''ankylosing spondylitis''.''It is theorized that an autoimmune reaction causes the loss of nerve cells in the brain in patients with narcolepsy. The environment (for example, infection or ''trauma'"") might trigger an autoimmune reaction where normal brain cells are attacked by the body's own immune system. As a result, the neurons are damaged and ultimately destroyed, and they and their neurotransmitter chemicals disappear. Whether narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease remains to be proven.""'The role of heredity in humans with narcolepsy is not completely understood. No consistent pattern of heredity has been recognized in families so far. It is estimated that relatives of patients with narcolepsy may have a higher predisposition to develop narcolepsy or sleep-related abnormalities, such as increased daytime sleepiness, increased REM sleep, or others. In dogs with narcolepsy, the disease is ''inherited'' in a predictable pattern. In these animals, the narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in a particular gene that is normally responsible for producing a receptor (binder) in the brain for the hypocretin neurotransmitter.' "
How is narcolepsy diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on a clinical evaluation, specific questionnaires, sleep logs or diaries, and the results of sleep laboratory tests.''Clinical evaluation includes a detailed medical history and physical examination by a physician.''Questionnaires''Questionnaires may be used in the assessment of patients with symptoms that suggest narcolepsy. The Stanford Narcolepsy Questionnaire is an extensive questionnaire that can provide the physician with valuable information on all symptoms of narcolepsy, but especially on cataplexy. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a brief self-administered questionnaire that provides an estimate of the degree of daytime sleepiness. A person rates the likelihood of falling asleep during specific activities. Using the scale from 0 to 3 below, the person ranks their risk of dozing in the chart below.''After ranking each category, the total score is calculated. The range is 0 to 24, with the higher the score the more sleepiness.''Scoring:'""Sleep logs or sleep diaries for 2 to 3 weeks are recommended in the evaluation of any patient with excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep diaries record the patient's usual sleep patterns (sleep deprivation, irregular sleep/wake pattern, interrupted sleep), ""'alcohol'' and/or ''drug use'', and common behaviors that cause the patient to lose sleep (for example, Internet syndrome - surfing the Internet until late at night, causing sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness.) This information may be helpful in the evaluation of a patient with excessive daytime sleepiness.''Sleep laboratory tests (""sleep studies"") for narcolepsy include polysomnography (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). Polysomnography (PSG) is a full night recording of several different physiological factors of a patient\'s sleep. A PSG is necessary to insure good quality sleep to identify any untreated causes for daytime sleepiness such as obstructive ''sleep apnea'"" (OSA). The PSG is followed the next day by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which is a recording of the patient's tendency to fall asleep during the day. These procedures provide objective measures of daytime sleepiness and REM sleep abnormalities.""'Daytime sleepiness is measured in the MSLT by the sleep latency (SL) time. This is the time from the beginning of the recording to the onset of sleep. In healthy individuals, the SL time is more than 10 minutes, whereas in narcolepsy, it could be as short as 0.5 minutes (an almost immediate onset of sleep).''REM sleep'' '' is named for the rapid eye movements (REM) that characterize this phase of sleep. In REM sleep dreams are vivid, muscle activity is suppressed, and brain activity is high. The REM sleep abnormality that is characteristic of narcolepsy is referred to as sleep onset REM periods. In healthy individuals, the first REM sleep period occurs about 80 to 120 minutes after the onset of sleep. By contrast, in narcolepsy, the initial REM sleep period usually occurs within 15 minutes of the onset of sleep. In addition, narcolepsy patients will have two or more sleep onset REM periods during the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) in the daytime.''PSG is also helpful in excluding other causes of daytime sleepiness, such as ''sleep apnea'' syndrome (SAS), periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), and sleep disruptions. In some cases, repeat tests may be recommended if there is worsening of the symptoms of narcolepsy despite treatment or if an additional sleep disorder is suspected (for example, sleep apnea syndrome).''Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) may be used to evaluate the effects of the treatment for narcolepsy. This test is a recording that measures the ability of a subject to stay awake during the day.''The diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy are described in the International Classification of ''Sleep Disorders''. These criteria indicate that the diagnosis may be based on clinical symptoms alone if both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are present. If cataplexy is not present, however, the diagnosis should be based on the clinical symptoms and polysomnographic findings.'""The blood test for a type of HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) has been observed to have a very high association with narcolepsy. Certain types of HLA are part of an individual's genetic or hereditary ""'makeup'' and can be characteristic of certain conditions, especially autoimmune diseases. The particular HLA type associated with narcolepsy is not unique for this condition as it is also found in 20% of the general population. Therefore, HLA typing is used for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. However, there is a strong association with certain genes in patients diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy. Many patients are known to have a specific HLA gene variant called DQB1*0602. Scientists continue to work in this area to better understand the pathogenesis of narcolepsy.' 0 to 9 = Average daytime sleepiness 10 to 15 = Excessive daytime sleepiness 16 to 24 = Moderate to severe daytime sleepiness"
What medications are used for the treatment for narcolepsy with cataplexy?,"'The types, number, and severity of the symptoms determine which ''drugs'' are used to treat the narcolepsy.''Anticataplectic medication'' is the general name for drugs that are used to treat cataplexy. These drugs may also be used for the other REM related symptoms, such as hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis.'' Tricyclic ''antidepressants'' (TCAs)'', used in lower than ''antidepressant'' doses, are often effective in controlling cataplexy. These medications act on neurotransmitter systems to produce suppression of REM sleep and consequently improve the symptoms of cataplexy.''The most frequently used TCAs for the treatment of cataplexy and other REM related symptoms are protriptyline (Vivactil), ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''clomipramine'' (''Anafranil''), ''desipramine'' (Norpramine), and ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''). Sedating TCAs such as clomipramine, amitriptyline, and imipramine, are usually prescribed for evening use, whereas the alerting ones (protriptyline and desipramine) are recommended for use during the day.''Sodium oxybate (Xyrem),'' also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate or GHB, is approved by the FDA to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This drug is usually administered in two doses; the first is given at bedtime and the second four hours later. It unifies sleep and improves the disturbed nighttime sleep characteristic of narcolepsy. This nighttime benefit may help decrease daytime drowsiness and cataplexy. Sodium oxybate is unrelated to drugs that are known to be sleep-inducing (hypnotic) and is not used for ''insomnia''. It can cause drowsiness and should only be taken at night.' "
What medications are used for the treatment of narcolepsy with EDS?,"'Alerting medications'' are used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness.''Amphetamines'' (for example, ''dextroamphetamine'' [''Dexedrine''], ''methamphetamine hydrochloride'' [''Desoxyn''], ''amphetamine and dextroamphetamine'' [''Adderall'']) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) are generalized central nervous system stimulants. These medications are used in narcolepsy to decrease sleepiness and improve alertness. However, they can also produce undesirable side effects including elevation of ''blood pressure'', nervousness, irritability, and rarely, paranoid reactions. Alerting medications can also lead to drug dependency due to the feeling of ''euphoria'' they can cause. However, drug dependency has rarely been described in individuals with narcolepsy.''Pemoline'' (''Cylert'') ''is used as an alerting medication but it is less effective than traditional stimulants. This drug has the potential risk of toxic side effects on the ''liver'' and ''liver blood tests'' need to be monitored frequently.''Modafinil (Provigil)'' has alerting effects similar to those of the traditional stimulant. Modafinil is not a general CNS stimulant like amphetamines, but the precise way it works is unknown. This drug has a much lower risk for ''high blood pressure'' and mental side effects because it acts in a different way than classic stimulants. It does not have significant effects on the sympathetic nervous system and does not cause ''mood changes'', ''euphoria'', or dependence. Furthermore, modafinil does not become ineffective with prolonged use. ''Headache'' and ''nausea'' are the most commonly reported side effects, and they are usually mild and temporary. These side effects can be reduced by a slow increase from a low initial dose up to the desired dose. This medication does not affect cataplexy and other REM sleep symptoms.''Modafinil is usually used in a single daily dose. Switching patients from amphetamines to modafinil may cause the reappearance of cataplexy in patients previously well controlled. Increasing the dose or adding an anti-cataplectic medication usually solves this problem.''Armodafinil'' (Nuvigil)'' is an oral drug used to promote wakefulness. It is similar to modafinil (Provigil).Armodafinil promotes wakefulness by stimulating the brain; however, the exact mechanism of action of armodafinil is unknown. Armodafinil may work by increasing the amount of ''dopamine'' (a chemical neurotransmitter that nerves use to communicate with each other) in the brain by reducing the reuptake of dopamine into nerves. The most common side effect of ararmodafinil is ''headache''. Other side effects including ''anxiety'', ''dizziness'', ''diarrhea'', ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', nausea, ''fatigue'', and ''rash'' may occur.The drug is recommended for single daily dosing, either in the morning, or one hour prior to a work shift.''Monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs''):'' A class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also be used for treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness. This includes phenelzine (Nardil) and ''selegiline'' (''Eldepryl'').''Anticataplectic medication'' is the general name for drugs that are used to treat cataplexy. These drugs may also be used for the other REM related symptoms, such as hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), used in lower than antidepressant doses, are often effective in controlling cataplexy. These medications act on neurotransmitter systems to produce suppression of REM sleep and consequently improve the symptoms of cataplexy.''In some cases, the side effects may limit the use of TCAs, although in most cases the side effects are temporary. The most frequent side effects are called ""anticholinergic side effects,"" including ''dry mouth'', ''dry eyes'', blurred vision, urine retention, ''constipation'', ''impotence'', increased appetite, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, restlessness, and ''headache''. Some of the TCAs may increase periodic limb movements in sleep, which could further disrupt already disturbed nighttime sleep in narcoleptic patients. If TCAs are abruptly discontinued, a significant worsening of the cataplexy and other REM related symptoms could occur. This ""rebound phenomenon"" may appear in 72 hours after discontinuation of the medication and peak in approximately 10 days from the withdrawal.''The most frequently used TCAs for the treatment of cataplexy and other REM related symptoms are protriptyline (Vivactil), imipramine (Tofranil), clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramine), and amitriptyline (Elavil). Sedating TCAs such as clomipramine, amitriptyline, and imipramine, are usually prescribed for evening use, whereas the alerting ones (protriptyline and desipramine) are recommended for use during the day.''Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)'' are also useful in treating cataplexy at doses that are comparable to those used to treat ''depression''. The most frequently used SSRIs for treatment of cataplexy and REM related symptoms are fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and venlafaxine (Effexor). The SSRIs may not be as effective as the TCAs, but they have fewer side effects. The most frequently reported side effects are dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, and mild ''tremor''. Rarely, mild constipation or ''diarrhea'' may occur. Fluoxetine (Prozac) given late in the day may cause insomnia.''Sodium oxybate (Xyrem)'', also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate or GHB, is approved by the FDA to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This drug is usually administered in two doses; the first is given at bedtime and the second four hours later. It unifies sleep and improves the disturbed nighttime sleep characteristic of narcolepsy. This nighttime benefit may help decrease daytime drowsiness and cataplexy. Sodium oxybate is unrelated to drugs that are known to be sleep-inducing (hypnotic) and is not used for insomnia. It can cause drowsiness and should only be taken at night.' "
Non-drug treatments,"'Non-drug treatments include education of the patient and family members and modification of behavior patterns. Understanding the symptoms of narcolepsy may help relieve some of the frustrations, fears, anger, ''depression'', and resentment of patients and family members. Emotional reactions are responses to both the unusual nature of the symptoms and society\'s ignorance of this disease. National organizations and local narcolepsy support groups are additional sources of information and assistance. (See ""For more information"" below.)''Behavioral approaches include establishing a regular, structured sleep-wake schedule. Planned naps of 15 to 30 minutes or longer may be beneficial in reducing daytime sleepiness. Certain dietary restrictions should be observed (for example, avoidance of large meals and alcohol). Regular ''exercise'"" and exposure to bright light can improve alertness. Occupational, marriage, and family counseling may help improve the patient's quality of life.""'Special considerations may be needed for school schedules and working conditions. Occupations that require working in shifts, changing the work schedule, or driving should be avoided. The dangers of driving while sleepy and/or experiencing cataplexy need to be addressed and the patients should be advised to avoid driving with these symptoms. However, many patients with narcolepsy are able to drive for short distances at certain times of the day and after taking their stimulant medications. Reporting requirements to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) differ from state to state. Some states require that individuals who have any lapses of consciousness or sleepiness be reported to the DMV.' "
Can narcolepsy be cured?,"""Narcolepsy is a life-long disease. The symptoms may vary in severity during the patient's lifespan, but they never disappear completely. Symptoms usually gradually worsen over time, and then tend to become stable. Even then, the excessive daytime sleepiness may become more pronounced and require additional medication. At other times, cataplexy or the other symptoms may decrease or even disappear for a time.""""Different factors contribute to changes in a patient's symptoms, including an irregular sleep/wake schedule, the use of substances or drugs that affect the central nervous system, infections of the brain, and the development of additional ""'sleep disorders'"", such as sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), periodic limb movements in sleep syndrome (PLMS), or others. Regular doctor check-ups and adherence to the drug plan and behavioral treatment may diminish these fluctuations and improve the patient's symptoms and quality of life.""'A primary care physician, usually in collaboration with a sleep medicine specialist, can recognize the symptoms of narcolepsy, initiate the proper evaluation, and manage the treatment that is recommended by the specialist.' "
How many people have narcolepsy?,"'The prevalence of narcolepsy is similar to that of '""Parkinson's""' disease and ''multiple sclerosis''. In the United States, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' estimates narcolepsy affects one in every 3,000 people.''Narcolepsy often remains undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for several years. This may occur because doctors do not consider the diagnosis of narcolepsy frequently enough. They may think of narcolepsy only in people who have the main symptom of excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy may not be considered in the evaluation of patients who come to doctors complaining of ''fatigue'', ''tiredness'', or problems with concentration, attention, memory, and performance, and other illnesses (''seizures'', mental illness, etc.)' "

What specialists treat narcolepsy?,"'There are many specialties of doctors a person with narcolepsy might consult for treatment, including:' A primary care physician (such as a general practitioner, family practitioner, internal medicine specialist, and a pediatrician): This is usually the primary health care professional. Neurologist: This is a physician who treats disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Sleep medicine specialist: This is often a neurologist or pulmonologist, but can be another qualified doctor. Psychiatrist: This is a physician who spcializes in the treatment of mental, emotional, and addition disorders."
What is deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy/turbinoplasty?,'Nasal obstruction is often caused by a deviated or crooked septum or enlarged tissues (inferior turbinates or inferior nasal conchae) within the nose. A septoplasty is an operation to correct a deformity of the partition (the septum) between the two sides of the nose. A turbinectomy is the surgical reduction or actual removal of an abnormally enlarged turbinate from inside the nose to improve ''breathing''.''The goals of nasal airway surgery include the following:' Improve airflow through the nose Control nosebleeds Enhance visualization of the inside of the nose (to identify other nasal problems) Relieve nasal or sinus headaches associated with swelling of the inside of the nose Promote drainage of the sinus cavities
What are risks and complications of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'Although the surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results, patients have the right to be informed that the surgery may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, anesthetic reactions, and healing outcomes, ultimately, there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications. Furthermore, surgical outcomes may be dependent on preexisting or concurrent medical conditions. Additional surgery may be necessary after the nose has had a chance to heal after surgery. Moreover, adherence to follow-up instructions and appointments by the patient can influence the surgical results.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for information only, not to frighten patients, but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning these surgical procedures. Although many of these complications are rare, they can occur even in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standard of care for the procedure. Anyone who is contemplating surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery. The following is a list of complications that may occur with these nasal surgeries:' Nasal obstruction due to failure to straighten the septum or later re-deviation of the septum, or the re-growth or swelling of the turbinates. This may necessitate revision surgery. Failure to resolve coexisting sinus infections or recurrence of coexisting sinus problems and/or polyps, or need for further or more aggressive surgery. Bleeding. In rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion. Chronic nasal drainage, or excessive dryness or crusting of the nose or sinuses Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is neither a cure for nor a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illnesses such as, but not limited to asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and have many causes that are not due to nasal septum or turbinates. Patients may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. Brain fluid (CSF) leak or infection. Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Septal perforation, which is a hole inside the nose (septum) that produces an open connection between the right and left sides of the nose. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste, or failure to relieve nosebleeds."
What happens before deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either a hospital or surgicenter. In both facilities, quality health care is provided. An anesthesiologist will monitor the sedated patient throughout the procedures. If the doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, patients should arrange to have these done several days in advance. Patients should bring a copy of these results with them the day of surgery for the anesthesiologist and surgeon to review. Patients need to arrange for someone to transport them home from the surgical facility, and to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, as previously mentioned.'""After surgery, the doctor may ask patients to start using salt water (saline) irrigation's. The doctor will instruct the patient on how, what, and when to start and using irrigation.""'Patients should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the surgery date. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'') should not be taken within 7 days prior to the surgery date. If you are on any blood thinners, sucha as Courmadin or ''Eliquis'', tell your doctor, and follow any instructions. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or ibuprofen type ''drugs'"" so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question individuals should call the health care professional's office or consult a Pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the doctor will give necessary prescription medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.'""Patients will receive instructions about eating and drinking limitations prior to surgery. These instructions also will include water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. Patient's who smoke should make every effort to stop ""'smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. Patients should discuss this precaution specifically with their surgeon and specifically inform the anesthesiologist about their ''smoking'"" history so that the doctors clearly understand the patient's preoperative condition.""'If patients are sick or have a ''fever'"" the day before surgery, they should call the doctor's office. If they wake up sick the day of surgery, they could still proceed to the surgical facility as planned for an evaluation. The doctor will decide if it's safe to proceed with surgery."" "
What happens the day of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'It is important for patients to know precisely what time to check in with the surgical facility, and to allow sufficient preparation time. Patients should bring all papers and forms with them including any pre-operative orders and history sheets. They should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes which do not have to be pulled over the head. All jewelry and valuables should be left at home. All make-up should be removed with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. They should not apply make-up, lotion, or cream to the face.''Patients should not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and patients may be given a sedative medication to help them relax.' "
"What happens during deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or 
turbinectomy?","'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthetic sedation at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored with devices including a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and a cardiac rhythm monitor (''EKG'""). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The entire procedure takes approximately one hour, however this can vary greatly depending on the patient's anatomical considerations for the surgeon. The doctor will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely transported to the recovery room."" "
What happens after deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient. They will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. The patient will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility and take them home. It may be necessary for the family member or friend to spend the first night with the patient after surgery for assistance.''When patients arrive home from the surgical facility, they should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'' they can minimize fluid accumulation in the tissues (''edema'') and swelling. They may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. Patients should avoid straining while urinating or passing ''stool''. If constipated they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Patients may have some swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling will gradually resolve and is normal. They can help reduce the swelling by putting ice on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetable in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which is more likely to conform to the face.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal, and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed only when saturated. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. After a few days, patients will usually no longer need to use the dressing. Patients should not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') such as ibuprofen or naproxen for three weeks following surgery.''It is best for patients to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once recovered fully from the anesthetic. Hot liquids should be avoided for several days. Even though the individual may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to proceed slowly with food intake to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, the person may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if ''vomiting'' persists, the doctor can prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills that have been prescribed. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed. If patients require narcotics, they are cautioned not to drive. In some situations, the doctor may prescribe steroids to reduce inflammation either preoperatively and/or postoperatively. It is very important that patients take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. If patients have ''nausea'' or vomiting postoperatively, they may be prescribed ''anti-nausea'' medications (''antiemetics''). If patients have any questions or they feel they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, they should consult their doctor. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed the medications with the doctor.' "
General instructions and follow-up care for deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy,"'In most situations, packs will have been placed in the nose to control bleeding; often times a septal splint is placed that will be removed by the surgeon at the first post-operative visit. The doctor will let the patient know when they are to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment and should arrange for someone to drive them to and from the office for this first visit. They should eat a light meal before going, and avoid taking excessive pain medications. They may also have several subsequent office visits to assess healing, remove crusts (debris) that may accumulate at the surgical site, especially if combined with ''sinus surgery''. Such visits help insure a speedy recovery. The nose will probably be tender after surgery, so the doctor will spray it with a special numbing medication before removing crusts.'""After the packing has been removed, patients may breathe through the nose, but are not to blow or sneeze through the nose for 7 to 10 days. If the person must sneeze, they should open their mouth. Patients can expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply ice and rest quietly with head elevated while holding the nose. If bleeding continues, they should call the surgeon's office for advice.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery is nasal irrigation (rinsing). Immediately after the nasal packs are removed they should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusts from forming in their nose. Patients are to continue using irrigation until the doctor tells them to stop. Many patients will use irrigations (for example, neti-pots) indefinitely or when they have an ''upper respiratory infection''. Failure to irrigate especially as instructed after surgery will likely cause the surgery to fail.''Patients may go back to work or school only when the doctor indicates it is safe to return. They should rest for the first week following surgery. They must also avoid excessive talking, smiling, chewing hard foods, strenuous activities, bumping their nose, bending over, and lifting heavy objects. They should not rest glasses on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subsides. They may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any irritation has resolved. ''Alcohol'' and tobacco products should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. Facial tanning is discouraged for six months after surgery. If patients must be in the sun they should use a number 15 or greater sun block. Patients may use their usual make-up any time after surgery.''Patients should lubricate the nostrils, as instructed with a Q-tip and Vaseline to soften crusts that are hard and firmly attached to healing tissue. Peroxide helps to loosen crusts. After several days they may notice a few of the absorbable ''sutures'' and should not try to disturb or remove them. They must be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. These teeth will often be tender for several weeks, and there may be some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''After three weeks if patients are not having problems with bleeding, they may resume ''exercise'' and ''swimming'', but no diving for two months. They should plan to stay in town and not travel for three weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs.' "
When to call the doctor after septoplasty or turbinectomy,"'Patients should notify the doctor if they have:''Most surgeons want to know about complications or problems that develop with their patients, so do not\xa0hesitate to call the surgeon to inform them and ask questions about any problems you are experiencing.' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid and acetaminophen (Tylenol). A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour. Persistent sharp pain or headache which is not relieved by the pain medication prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes."
Key points," Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasopharynx. Ethnic background and being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus can affect the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer. Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer include trouble breathing, speaking, or hearing. Tests that examine the nose and throat are used to detect (find) and diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options."
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasopharynx.,'The nasopharynx is the upper part of the pharynx (throat) behind the nose. The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and ''esophagus'' (the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach). Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus. The nostrils lead into the nasopharynx. An opening on each side of the nasopharynx leads into an ear. Nasopharyngeal cancer most commonly starts in the squamous cells that line the nasopharynx.''Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of ''head and neck cancer''.' 
Ethnic background and being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus can affect the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.,"""Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for nasopharyngeal cancer include the following:"" Having Chinese or Asian ancestry. Being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus: The Epstein-Barr virus has been associated with certain cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and some lymphomas. Drinking large amounts of alcohol."
"Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer include trouble breathing, speaking, or hearing.",'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'   A lump in the nose or neck. A sore throat. Trouble breathing or speaking. Nosebleeds. Trouble hearing. Pain or ringing in the ear. Headaches.
Tests that examine the nose and throat are used to detect (find) and diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:'   Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as swollen lymph nodes in the neck or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Neurological exam: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:Nasoscopy: A procedure to look inside the nose for abnormal areas. A nasoscope is inserted through the nose. A nasoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.Upper endoscopy: A procedure to look at the inside of the nose, throat, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Nasoscopy: A procedure to look inside the nose for abnormal areas.

It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET scans may be used to find nasopharyngeal cancers that have spread to the bone. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus and DNA markers of the Epstein-Barr virus. These are found in the blood of patients who have been infected with EBV. Hearing test: A procedure to check whether soft and loud sounds and low- and high-pitched sounds can be heard. Each ear is checked separately."
"After nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body.",'The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the nasopharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)' 
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.,"'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer:,"'In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the nasopharynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called ''carcinoma in situ''.''In stage I, cancer has formed and the cancer:''The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the ''tonsils''.''In stage II nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:''The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the ''tonsils''. The parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.''In stage III nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:''The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. The parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.''Stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.''Recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated.

Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller. Stage IVA: Cancer has spread beyond the nasopharynx and may have spread to the cranial nerves, the hypopharynx (bottom part of the throat), areas in and around the side of the skull or jawbone, and/or the bone around the eye. Cancer may also have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes between the collarbone and the top of the shoulder and/or the affected lymph nodes are larger than 6 centimeters. Stage IVC: Cancer has spread beyond nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body."
There are different types of treatment for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.,"'Different types of treatment are available for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Three types of standard treatment are used:''Radiation therapy'' is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of ''radiation'' to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer.''External radiation therapy to the thyroid or the ''pituitary gland'' may change the way the thyroid gland works. A blood test to check the ''thyroid hormone'' level in the blood is done before and after therapy to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly. It is also important that a dentist check the patient’s ''teeth'', gums, and mouth, and fix any existing problems before radiation therapy begins.''Chemotherapy'' is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Chemotherapy may be given after radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after radiation therapy, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Surgery is a procedure to find out whether cancer is present, to remove cancer from the body, or to repair a body part. Also called an operation. Surgery is sometimes used for nasopharyngeal cancer that does not respond to radiation therapy. If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the doctor may remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck.''For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.''Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.'   External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. Compared to standard radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy may be less likely to cause dry mouth. Stereotactic radiation therapy: A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Treatment options by stage,"'Treatment of stage I nasopharyngeal cancer is usually radiation therapy to the tumor and lymph nodes in the neck.''Treatment of stage II nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:' Chemotherapy given with radiation therapy, followed by more chemotherapy. Radiation therapy to the tumor and lymph nodes in the neck. Chemotherapy given with radiation therapy, which may be followed by more chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy followed by surgery to remove cancer -containing lymph nodes in the neck that remain or come back after radiation therapy. A clinical trial of chemotherapy given before, with, or after radiation therapy. Chemotherapy given with radiation therapy, followed by more chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy followed by surgery to remove cancer -containing lymph nodes in the neck that remain or come back after radiation therapy. Chemotherapy for cancer that has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body. A clinical trial of chemotherapy given before, with, or after radiation therapy."
Treatment options for recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer,"'Treatment of recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer may include the following:' Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, or internal radiation therapy. Surgery. Chemotherapy. A clinical trial of chemotherapy. A clinical trial of stereotactic radiation therapy."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the nasopharynx, involves the whole nasopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body). The type of nasopharyngeal cancer. The size of the tumor. The patient’s age and general health."
What are the definitions of mild and severe sunburns? What are their symptoms and signs?,"   Sunburn is the result of too much exposure to the sun, or a sun-equivalent (such as a tanning bed or other UV source). Sunburn is most common during the summer when the sun’s rays are the strongest. Mild sunburn symptoms include skin redness and pain. After about 4-7 days, skin peeling may occur. Severe sunburn symptoms are called sun poisoning and may include: Skin burning and blistering Fluid loss (dehydration) Electrolyte imbalance Infection To prevent sunburn: Stay out of the sun Cover your skin Wear protective eyewear When in the sun (you can get burned even if it's cloudy) use SPF (sun protection factor) 30 or higher Avoid tanning beds If you are sunburned, stay out of the run until the burn fades. Drink lots of water, sports drinks, or juice to stay hydrated, and keep your house cool using air conditioning or fans. Home remedies for sunburn include cool compresses and baths, some essential oils and herbs, certain foods or supplements, and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers."
What home remedies get rid of mild to moderate sunburns fast? What about severe sunburns (pictures)?,"   Place a cool compress on sunburned skin for immediate sunburn pain relief, for example, a compress containing Burow's solution (such as Domeboro Powder Packets -1 packet in 1 pint of water) to comfort and soothe sunburn. Take a cool shower or bath to cool your sunburned skin. Some natural bath therapies to soothe sunburn pain and other symptoms include:Add one cup of apple cider vinegar to a bath to help balance the pH (acid or alkalinity) of sunburned skin, and promote healing.Soak in an oatmeal bath. This is especially helpful for itchy, sunburned skin.Add some lavender or chamomile essential oil to the bath to help relieve some of the stinging and pain.Add 2 cups of baking soda to the bath to help ease irritation and redness from sunburn.Avoid soap or perfumes in the bath water as these can be drying on already dry and sunburned skin.

Add 2 cups of baking soda to the bath to help ease irritation and redness from sunburn. Avoid soap or perfumes in the bath water as these can be drying on already dry and sunburned skin."
"Essential oils, herbs, and natural products to relieve pain and other sunburn symptoms","'Once the initial sunburn has calmed down, ''coconut oil ''can be used as a skin moisturizer. ''Do not use coconut oil as ''sunscreen''! Coconut oil does not provide any ''sun protection'' factor (''SPF'') or UV protection, so you are more likely to be sunburned if you use coconut oil in place of sunblock with SPF.'   Essential oils such as lavender or Helichrysum can be applied in small amounts to the skin to soothe sunburn. Use lotions that contain aloe Vera to soothe and moisturize sunburnt skin. Some aloe products contain lidocaine, an anesthetic that can help relieve sunburn pain. Aloe Vera is also a good moisturizer for peeling skin. Apply freshly brewed tea after it has cooled to sunburned skin using a clean cloth. The tannic acid in black tea reportedly helps draw heat from sunburned skin, and aids in restoring the pH balance. Add mint to the tea for a more cooling effect. Apply teabags soaked in cold water to sunburned eyelids to soothe the burn and reduce inflammation. Witch hazel when applied to the skin can help reduce inflammation, and can help relieve sunburn. Apply petroleum jelly or Aquaphor ointment on sunburned lips to keep them moisturized."
Foods and vitamins to sooth and relieve sunburn pain,"   Apply cool, not cold, milk with a clean cloth to your sunburned skin. The milk will create a protein film that helps ease sunburn discomfort. Like milk, yogurt applied to sunburned skin also can be soothing. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, and can help decrease inflammation caused by sunburn. Use Vitamin E oil on the skin, or take a regular dose of the supplement. Vitamin E oil also can be rubbed onto peeling skin. Cucumbers have natural antioxidant and analgesic (pain relieving) properties. Chill cucumbers, then mash in a blender to create a paste, and apply to affected sunburned areas including the face. Cucumber also can be soothing for peeling skin following a sunburn. Boil and mash peeled potatoes, let cool, and apply as a dressing to sunburned areas. It is believed the starch in the potatoes helps draw out heat, which may reduce pain and speed healing. Cornstarch also can be mixed with water to form a paste that can be applied to skin to help soothe the sunburn."
Over the counter (OTC) medicine for sunburn pain relief,"'If you are taking any medications that make your skin more ''sensitive to the sun'' (such as tetracyclines, ''thiazides'', ''sulfonamides'', phenothiazines, ''oral contraceptives'', diuretics, ''drugs for diabetes'') contact your doctor to see if there are different medications you can take that will make you less likely to get sunburned. ''Do not stop taking any prescribed medication without first consulting your doctor.' Take OTC pain relievers like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) to help relieve sunburn pain and inflammation. Topical over-the-counter (OTC) 1% hydrocortisone cream may help relieve sunburn symptoms such as pain, itch, and swelling."
How to care for blisters and peeling from a severe sunburn (pictures)," If your skin is peeling following a bad sunburn, avoid picking at it or peeling it further. If you have blisters, this is a sign of a severe sunburn. It is best to cover them to prevent tearing and leave them alone until they heal. The best remedy against sunburn is prevention. Always use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, wear protective clothing and sunglasses, and avoid direct sun exposure."
Other tips for a bad sunburn (pictures of blisters from second-degree burns)," Hydrate, drink a lot of water, juice, or sports drinks. Your skin is dry and dehydrated. Replacing lost body fluids will help your skin heal from sunburn more quickly. If you feel hot from your sunburn, keep your house cool. Turn down the A/C and use fans to help blow cool air over the skin. Go inside or in the shade, and stay out of the sun until your sunburn fades. Exposure to more sunlight will only make things worse."
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
What is nature vs. nurture (definitions)?,"'In the context of the nature vs. nurture debate, “nature” refers to biological/genetic predispositions’ impact on human traits, and nurture describes the influence of learning and other influences from one’s environment. The debate over whether the strengths and weaknesses of people are the result of nature or nurture has, and somewhat continues to rage on between scholars and lay people alike. This debate has had significant social implications, particularly concerning what are thought to determine people’s ability to learn/intelligence (Lynch, 2016).' "
What is the nature vs. nurture? Who created the theory?,"'The initial use of the Nature vs. Nurture Theory was credited to psychologist Sir Francis Galton in 1869 (Bynum, 2002). However, it is unclear who initially described the impact of genes and biology versus environmental influences. Scientists, doctors, researchers, psychologists, behaviorists, and many others have debated these theories since Hippocrates was alive.''Around 400 B.C.E., Hippocrates described human behaviors as being biological, the result of four different body fluid types called humors.''In contrast, many centuries later, philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke independently thought that people are born as blank slates (i.e. ""tabula rasa""), and that their eventual individual differences develop solely due to the result of environmental influences (Psychology Encyclopedia, 2017; Duschinsky, 2012; Nesterak, 2015). Twentieth century behavioral psychologist John Watson shared a similar perspective, believing that the events that take place during early childhood have far more influence on what kind of adults we become compared to the effects of our genes (Haggbloom et al, 2002).'

How does nature vs. nurture affect our genes?,'Most conventional theories of nature vs. nurture consider the differences in humans a result of elements of both your genetic ''makeup'' and your environment.' 
What are examples of nature vs. nurture?,"'While certain physical traits like skin and eye color and diseases like ''sickle cell anemia'' and Huntington’s chorea have been found to be the result of direct genetic inheritance, virtually any pattern of thinking or behavior can be understood from the perspective of a combination of nature and nurture. In the animal kingdom, domestication of many species is understood to be the result of encouraging domesticated behaviors (nurture), then having animals that most successfully adopt those behaviors breed with each other so it becomes part of their nature (Bouchard, 1994).''In humans, many studies in more than the past 20 years involve identical or fraternal twins who are separated at birth. The question of nature vs. nurture somewhat continues to be debated concerning human behavior, intelligence, and in the development of personality traits (Psychology Encyclopedia, 2017).' "
How does nature vs. nurture affect our mental and physical health?,"'It is understood that certain physical traits, as well as the susceptibility to most physical and ''mental health'' disorders tend to run in families. Specifically, whatever illnesses your parents, grandparents, siblings, and other biological family members have does not guarantee you will inherit them, but it does increase the likelihood that you may develop them.''On the other hand, it is understood that environmental factors often have a significant effect on whether or not you develop the health problems that run in your family. (You can change your gene expressions).''A couple of examples of how the ''environment (nurture) can provide a benefit'', and possibly decrease your risk in getting an illness from your family are:' If you are at risk for heart disease or diabetes, eat a healthy diet and exercise. If you are at risk for other conditions, for example, breast or colon cancer, get regular health screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies per your doctor's recommendations. Exposure to community violence increasing the likelihood of anxiety Depression and negative behaviors Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke may develop cancers more often than those who do not have that experience (Nesterak, 2015)."
Is our intelligence based on nature or nurture?,"'As with most human traits, intelligence is now understood to be the result of some combination of both nature and nurture. While genes have a great influence on the size and biochemistry of the brain, its full development does not usually occur until after the first 20 years of life. Also, the heredity of intelligence tends to vary between different aspects of cognition.''Intelligence and subsequent learning also are viewed as being largely molded by the environment the person grows up in, both before and after birth. (European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2007; Kan et al, 2013). Therefore, to reduce your risk of inheriting diseases or illness from your family (or passing them on to your children):' Eat a healthy diet. If you are pregnant, don't drink alcohol or use other illegal drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure that any current drugs or supplements you are taking will not harm your baby. It is imperative to have safe communities and schools that nurture learning and confidence for all children so that the quest can continue to promote high cognitive development in each child."
What is nausea? What is vomiting?,"'Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of an underlying illness and due to a not a specific disease. Nausea is the sensation that the stomach wants to empty itself, while vomiting (emesis) or throwing up, is the act of forcible emptying of the stomach. The term ""dry heaves"" (retching) refers to an episode of vomiting where there is no food in the stomach to vomit, and only small amounts of clear secretions are vomited.''Vomiting is a violent act in which the stomach, the ''esophagus'', stomach, and small intestine forcibly expel contents of the stomach (and sometimes the small intestine) in a coordinated fashion.'  "
What causes nausea and vomiting?,"'There are many causes of nausea and vomiting, for example:'   Acute gastritis (direct irritation of the stomach lining) Central causes in which signals from the vomiting center in the brain cause nausea and vomiting Other illnesses not due to stomach problems, for example, brain tumors, pancreatitis, and appendicitis Medications, medical treatments, and illicit or illegal drugs, drug or alcohol overdose Mechanical obstruction of the bowel"
"Gastrointestinal (GI, digestive) causes of anusea and vomiting","'Acute gastritis or ''esophagitis'' often caused by something that irritates the lining of the stomach or throat, for example:' Infections: Infections are often the cause of stomach irritation, whether it is a common virus or another type of infection. There may be associated crampy upper abdominal pain that is associated with nausea and vomiting. Fever and chills may be present. Common viral infections include noroviruses and rotavirus. Infection by bacteria in the Helicobacter family (such as H. Pylori) can also be the infectious agent. Stomach flu: Stomach flu (gastroenteritis) is when vomiting and diarrhea occur together and is associated with a viral infection that is outside of the stomach. It should not be confused with the flu (influenza), a viral infection with symptoms include fever, chills, cough, and muscle pain. Food poisoning: Food poisoning may cause significant vomiting, and the most common cause is a toxin released by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Symptoms of food poisoning begin within a couple hours of eating contaminated or poorly prepared food. Other bacterial causes of food poisoning include Salmonella,  Campylobacter,  Shigella, E. coli, Listeria, or Clostridium botulinum (botulism). Other stomach irritants: alcohol, smoking, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen may irritate the stomach lining and cause nausea and vomiting. Peptic ulcer disease: Peptic ulcer disease can range from mild irritation of the stomach lining to the formation of a defect in the protective lining of the stomach called an ulcer. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, reflux esophagitis): Nausea or vomiting is also associated with GERD (acid from the stomach is refluxed into the esophagus)."
During pregnancy (morning sickness) cuases of nausea and vomiting,"'Vomiting in pregnancy is caused by hormone level changes in the bloodstream. Most women have moderate symptoms of ''morning sickness'', especially during the\xa0''first trimester''. The symptoms of morning sickness during pregnancy usually resolve by the fourth month. Rarely, a woman may experience severe vomiting, dehydration, and ''weight loss'', which is referred to as\xa0''hyperemesis gravidarum''.' "
Neurological causes of nausea and vomiting," Headache: especially migraine because it commonly is associated with nausea and vomiting. Inner ear: Motion sickness, labyrinthitis, benign positional vertigo, or Meniere's disease Increased pressure in the head (intracranial pressure): Any illness or injury that increases the pressure within the skull can cause vomiting.Brain swelling due to trauma (includes bleeding within the brain)Infection (meningitis or encephalitis)Tumors (benign or malignant)Abnormal electrolyte concentrations in the bloodstream and associated water imbalanceConcussion, patients with head injuries do not have to have detectable bleeding in the brain or brain swelling to have symptoms of brain irritation, which can include a headache, nausea, vomiting, changes in vision, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. Brain swelling due to trauma (includes bleeding within the brain) Infection (meningitis or encephalitis) Tumors (benign or malignant) Abnormal electrolyte concentrations in the bloodstream and associated water imbalance Concussion, patients with head injuries do not have to have detectable bleeding in the brain or brain swelling to have symptoms of brain irritation, which can include a headache, nausea, vomiting, changes in vision, confusion, difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. Smells, sounds, and trauma: Certain smells or sounds can cause nausea and vomiting that originates in the brain. Whether it is the pain of a broken bone or the emotional shock of observing an event, vasovagal events can cause significant symptoms. In a vasovagal episode, the vagus nerve (one of the nerves that helps control basic body functions like heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure) is overly stimulated and can cause the heart rate to slow and blood vessels to dilate. This decreases the flow of blood to the brain and can cause fainting (syncope). Heat-related illness: For example heat exhaustion, extreme sunburn, or dehydration"
"Diabetes, diseases, and eating disorders","'People with ''diabetes'' can also develop nausea and vomiting should their blood sugars become abnormally high or low (''hyperglycemia'' or ''hypoglycemia'') because the ''sugar'' and ''insulin'' balance is disturbed.' Diabetes: Persons with diabetes may develop nausea because of gastroparesis, a condition in which the stomach fails to empty properly and is likely due to the generalized neuropathy (failure of the nerves in the body to send proper signals to and from the brain or regeneration of nerves in the stomach) that is a complication of the disease. Diseases, illness, or conditions: Many illnesses associated with the intra-abdominal organs can produce the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. These include digestive organ disease such as:HepatitisGallbladder diseasePancreatitisCrohn's diseaseKidney diseases (for example, kidney stones, infection, kidney failure)Some forms of cancerAppendicitis Hepatitis Gallbladder disease Pancreatitis Crohn's disease Kidney diseases (for example, kidney stones, infection, kidney failure) Some forms of cancer Appendicitis Abdominal adhesions. Abdominal pain and distention, nausea and vomiting, and inability to pass flatus (gas) or have a bowel movement are symptoms of intestinal (bowel obstruction). Common causes of bowel obstruction include previous surgery with the formation of adhesions, hernias, abnormal twisting of the GI tract, tumors, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.. Vomiting as an atypical symptom of another disease: Some additional illnesses will cause nausea and vomiting, even though there is no direct involvement of the stomach or gastrointestinal tract.Heart attack victims may experience nausea and vomiting as an atypical symptom of angina, especially if the heart attack affects the inferior or lower part of the heart.Lung infections, for example, pneumonia and bronchitis, may also cause nausea and vomiting, especially if the area of lung involved is near the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest form the abdomen. Heart attack victims may experience nausea and vomiting as an atypical symptom of angina, especially if the heart attack affects the inferior or lower part of the heart. Lung infections, for example, pneumonia and bronchitis, may also cause nausea and vomiting, especially if the area of lung involved is near the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest form the abdomen. Sepsis: An overwhelming body infection spread through the bloodstream may also be associated with nausea and vomiting. Eating disorders: Patients with bulimia will have self-induced vomiting, purging as part of their psychiatric illness"
Nausea and vomitnig caused by drug side effects,"   Side effects from medications: The side effect of many medications include stomach irritation and/or nausea and vomiting. Anti-cancer drugs used for chemotherapy commonly cause nausea and vomiting that is not easily relieved. Narcotic pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, steroids, and antibiotics all have nausea and vomiting listed as common side effects. Radiation therapy: Nausea and vomiting can be associated with radiation therapy. Chemotherapy for cancer"
Vomiting in infants,"'It may be hard to decide if an infant is vomiting or spitting up. If the episodes occur shortly after feeding and only a small amount comes up, this may be spitting up.' Forceful vomiting: In the first two or three months, if the vomiting is forceful after eating (imagine it flying across the room), this may be a sign of pyloric stenosis, or an abnormal narrowing of the pylorus, the location where the stomach empties into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). The vomiting is impressive and is described as a projectile. The diagnosis is often made by history and physical examination, confirmed by ultrasound. The treatment is surgery. Vomiting associated with pain: if the infant cries uncontrollably, and if the stool is bloody or red, the diagnosis may be an intussusception (the pushing of one segment of the bowel into an adjacent segment). The stool is classically described as currant jelly, but any blood in the stool is not normal and should always be a cause for concern. It is reasonable to seek medical care for an inconsolable infant. Viral infection: If there is vomiting with associated diarrhea that is not bloody, then a viral infection is a possibility. Alternatively, there may be an issue with intolerance to the type of baby formula. Infants and children are at greater risk of dehydration if the vomiting episodes last for more than 24 hours. If dehydration is suspected, seek medical care. Signs and symptoms of dehydration in an infant include dry mouth, lack of sweat in the armpits and groin, sunken eyes, weakness with a poor cry, and decreased muscle tone."
How is the cause of nausea and vomiting diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis often can be made when the health care professional takes a careful history and performs a physical examination. Any tests that need to be ordered will be based on the information from the history and physical exam, and sometimes no further testing is required to make the diagnosis.''Laboratory tests and ''X-rays'' may be ordered to assess the stability of the patient and not necessarily to make the diagnosis. For example, a patient with food poisoning may need blood tests ordered to measure the electrolytes(''minerals'') and other chemicals, since the patient may lose significant amounts of sodium, potassium, and chloride from the body from persistent vomiting and ''diarrhea''.''Urinalysis'' may be helpful in assessing hydration status. Concentrated, ''dark urine'' is associated with dehydration because the kidneys try to preserve as much water as possible in the body. Ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.' "
What treatments and drugs help relieve nausea or vomiting?,"'Nausea and vomiting can be treated with medication at the same time as the search for the underlying diagnosis are being carried out. Ideally, these symptoms should resolve when the underlying illness is treated and controlled.''Nausea and vomiting are often made worse when you are dehydrated, resulting in a vicious cycle. Nausea makes it difficult to drink fluid, making the dehydration worse, which then increases nausea. Intravenous fluids may be provided to correct this issue and break the cycle.''There are varieties of ''anti-nausea'' medications (''antiemetics'') that your doctor may prescribe. These drugs can be administered in different ways depending upon your ability to take them. Medications are available by pill, liquid, or tablets that dissolve on or under the tongue, by intravenous or intramuscular injection, or by rectal suppository.''Common medications used to control nausea and vomiting include:'""The decision as to which medication to use will depend on the patient's condition."" promethazine (Phenergan), prochlorperazine (Compazine), droperidol (Inapsine) metoclopramide (Reglan), and ondansetron (Zofran)."
What natural home remedies help relieve nausea and vomiting?,"'It is important to rest the stomach and yet still avoid dehydration. Clear fluids should be attempted for the first 24 hours of an illness, and then the ''diet'' should be advanced as tolerated.''Clear fluids are easy for the stomach to absorb and include:'""It is important not to take too much fluid at one time since stretching the stomach theoretically may cause nausea to worsen. One to two ounces of fluid at a time, taken every 10-15 minutes, may be all that the stomach will be able to tolerate. In infants and children, the amount may be as little as 5 or 10 cc's or less than a third of an ounce at a time.""'Milk products should be avoided for the first 24-48 hours during an episode of nausea and vomiting. If the infection involves the small intestine, the enzyme that helps digest milk is located in cells lining the small intestine can become depleted. This can reduce the tolerance to milk and milk-containing products and lead to, ''bloating'', vomiting, and diarrhea. As the affected individual begins to feel better, they can begin to reintroduce foods, but to help the stomach readjust, health care professionals often recommend limiting the ''diet'' to bland foods such as bananas, applesauce, rice, toast (the BRAT diet).' Water Sports drinks Clear broths Popsicles Jell-O"
When should I call the doctor for nausea and vomiting?,"'If the symptoms last for more than 24 hours, if the diagnosis is uncertain, if there is concern about dehydration, or if the patient has underlying medical conditions that make them more fragile, medical care should be accessed sooner, rather than later.''Infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration and may not have as much reserve as an adult. If there is concern about dehydration or the inability to tolerate fluids, a health care professional should be contacted.''If nausea and vomiting are associated with pain, fever, ''vomiting blood'', or having bloody or black, tarry bowel movements, medical care should be sought immediately.''Vomiting is a symptom of an illness, if the symptom persists for more than 24-48 hours, it may be wise to contact a health care professional.'

What is a nerve conduction velocity test (NCV)?,"'A nerve conduction velocity test (NCV) is an electrical test that is used to determine the adequacy of the conduction of the nerve impulse as it courses down a nerve. This test is used to detect signs of nerve injury. '""In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated, and the electrical impulse 'down stream' from the stimulus is measured. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease or abnormal pressure on the nerve. A nerve conduction velocity test is often done at the same time as an ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''). An EMG is carried out in order to exclude or detect muscle conditions which may be present due to muscular or neurologic disease. '  "
Why the nerve conduction velocity test is performed,"'Symptoms that might prompt a health care professional to order a nerve conduction velocity test test include numbness, tingling, and/or burning sensations. The nerve conduction velocity test test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as ''peripheral neuropathy'' and mononeuritis multiplex) or conditions whereby nerves are affected by mechanical compression injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome'' and other compression neuropathies). A normal body temperature must be maintained for the nerve conduction velocity test, because low body temperatures slow the speed of nerve conduction.' "
What is NDM-1?,"'Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria (not ''viruses'' or fungi). There are different groups of antibiotics, based on how they work to kill bacteria. Beta-lactam antibiotics (or beta-lactams) are the largest group of antibiotics used against common infections. Carbapenems are another class of antibiotics typically used as a last resort when beta-lactams no longer work.''When bacteria are no longer killed by an antibiotic, they are called resistant to that antibiotic. Some bacteria are resistant to so many antibiotics there are few or no treatments left. These are often called ""superbugs.""''The beta-lactam group includes penicillins and cephalosporins. There are many types of beta-lactamases. Bacteria can become resistant by producing substances that destroy beta-lactams; these are beta-lactamases. The carbapenem antibiotics are destroyed by carbapenemases. Few bacteria have resistance to carbapenems. Carbapenems are often the last resort antibiotic for resistant bacteria that beta-lactams can no longer kill.''NDM-1 stands for the carbapenemase ''New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1''. It is produced by bacteria containing the resistance gene '' ''bla''NDM-1. There are many types of carbapenemases that destroy penicillins, cephalosporins, and the last resort carbapenems, mostly produced by a large group of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae. These carbapenemase-producers are also called ''carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae'' or CRE bacteria. NDM-1 bacteria are only one of the many CRE that threaten health today.''NDM-1 infection was first recognized in 2009, in residents or travelers from India and Pakistan. Antibiotic use in India is poorly restricted, and it appears likely that overuse of carbapenems allowed NDM-1 to develop. Medical tourism may cause NDM-1 to spread among countries. Medical tourism refers to people who travel to a country to get medical care that is not available or is more expensive in their own country. The three first cases of NDM-1 infection in the United States were identified in June 2010 in Americans who had recently sought medical care in India. Vacation and business travel have also played a role in introducing NDM-1 bacteria into countries outside of the Indian subcontinent. Cases have now been detected in many countries, including Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Japan, and the United States. The number of cases is growing, and the concern is that these highly resistant bacteria could replace more antibiotic-susceptible strains. If this happens, many of the antibiotics that have been developed over the last 80 years will be useless. There are few new ways to kill bacteria that have not already been discovered, and it is feared that infections will return us to the days before antibiotics existed. Currently, NDM-1 bacteria are found mostly in health-care facilities, where antibiotics are used frequently. Therefore, these strains have also acquired resistance genes against other classes of antibiotics. These bacteria are true superbugs resistant to virtually all commonly used antibiotics.''NDM-1 and other resistant bacteria spread from person to person through contact with contaminated hands or items. Good hand hygiene is critical in hospitals to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses. This includes washing hands with plain soap and water (antibacterial soap causes more resistance) or disinfecting hands with alcohol-based sanitizer.''Most NDM-1 strains must be treated with an older antibiotic called colistin, which had fallen out of use because it can be toxic to kidneys. Some strains may be treatable with the antibiotic aztreonam, or a newer one, ''tigecycline'' (''Tygacil'').''Although NDM-1 has gotten a lot of attention, other CREs with different enzymes have been identified and have spread. This includes the CRE ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' species, also called KPC.' "
What causes NDM-1 to be produced in bacteria?,"'The ''bla''NDM-1 gene has been found on bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Plasmids are small segments of genetic material. Plasmids and other mobile genes can pass from one bacterial strain to another and even between completely different kinds.''Bacteria may develop gene mutations causing resistance spontaneously or on mobile genes. When a group of bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic, the ones that are resistant survive to multiply more of that bacteria. The more antibiotics are given, the more resistant bacteria are produced. This is called ""antibiotic pressure"" toward resistance. Reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure allows populations of bacteria to revert to more susceptible strains.' "
What are symptoms and signs of a person infected with bacteria carrying NDM-1?,"'Bacteria from the ''Enterobacteriaceae'' family are the most common cause of urinary infections. They can also cause bloodstream infections (''sepsis''), ''pneumonia'', or ''wound'' infections. Symptoms and signs depend on the location of the infection. Most people will have ''fever'' and ''fatigue'' and sometimes ''confusion''. If bacteria enter the bloodstream, patients may go into ''shock''. Symptoms do not differ between bacteria that express NDM-1 and those that do not. However, patients who have bacteria producing NDM-1 will not respond to most conventional antibiotics and are at high risk for complications or death.' "
How are bacteria that produce NDM-1 identified?,"'Laboratories routinely test bacteria for susceptibility to antibiotics. Strains that produce NDM-1 will show resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Because carbapenem resistance is still uncommon, resistance to these agents raises suspicion of an NDM-1 or CRE strain, although not all will be NDM-1. If the patient has recently been to an area where NDM-1 is common, like India or Pakistan, this increases the probability that the strain is producing NDM-1.''Specific testing for NDM-1 is not routinely available in most laboratories. Fortunately, most NDM-1 or CRE are susceptible to colistin and other ''drugs''. If a carbapenem-resistant isolate is recovered from a patient who has received medical care in India or Pakistan, it is sent to a state public-health laboratory. The state lab forwards it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for specific testing for NDM-1, and the movement of these strains can be closely tracked.' "
What is the treatment for an infection caused by bacteria that make NDM-1?,"'Many NDM-1 infections will respond to treatment. Colistin is an older antibiotic that has not been used much in recent decades due to toxicity. A few NDM-1 strains have been sensitive to tigecycline (Tygacil), but this agent is not the first choice in serious infections, because it does not achieve high levels in the blood. Further, it only stops bacteria from multiplying, rather than destroying them. A few NDM-1s have been susceptible to aztreonam, although most U.S. strains have not. Research for new treatments is ongoing.'  "
What is the prognosis for a person infected with NDM-1 producing bacteria?,"'NDM-1 infections can be successfully treated if they are recognized early and if colistin or other appropriate agents are used promptly. If a ''CRE infection'' is severe or the bacteria is aggressive, death is very possible. Death rate from KPC infections, for example, may be as high as 40%.' "
Is it possible to prevent infections with bacteria containing NDM-1?,"""Several major guidelines have been published about preventing resistant bacteria, and hospital accrediting organizations cannot accredit facilities that do not adhere to them. Hospital Infection Control programs monitor for resistant bacteria and use methods of blocking the spread of disease. Barriers between contaminated surfaces and health-care workers prevent transfer of bacteria from an infected patient to another patient or worker. Barriers for NDM-1 must be extremely strict to contain it. Patients with NDM-1 strains are placed in private rooms. Health-care workers must put on a gown and gloves when entering the room and carefully dispose of them in the room before leaving. The number of people caring for the patient, entering and leaving the room, and the patient's movements out of the room are minimized.""'Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs are also critical to controlling resistant bacteria. Such programs help to ensure that antibiotics are used for the right reason, at the right dose, and for the minimum time necessary to treat ''bacterial infections'"". This may involve an infectious-disease doctor and pharmacist reviewing antibiotic use and providing personalized feedback to patients' doctors. Carbapenem antibiotics are only given intravenously and should only be used when bacteria are resistant to other drugs.""'In the community, it is important that primary-care doctors and other health professionals prescribe antibiotics just as carefully. People should become informed about the pros and cons of antibiotics. Antibiotics do not kill viruses that cause most colds, ear and sinus infections, and ''bronchitis''. They do kill friendly flora though, which can result in worse infections and ''antibiotic resistance''. In addition, antibiotic ''allergies'' can be life-threatening; if you develop ''allergies'' to antibiotics because of overuse, it can reduce your options for treating serious infections even more than having an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection.' "
Where can people find more information about NDM-1 producing bacteria?,'More information about NDM-1 is available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.' 
Introduction,"'An ''asthma'' nebulizer, also known as a ''breathing'' machine, changes ''asthma'' medication from a liquid to a mist, so that it can be more easily inhaled into the ''lungs''. Home nebulizer therapy is particularly effective in delivering ''asthma medications'' to infants and small children and to anyone who is unable to use ''asthma'' inhalers with spacers.''To obtain an asthma nebulizer, you need a prescription from your physician. Home nebulizers vary in cost (approximately $200-250) and are usually covered under the durable medical equipment portion of health insurance policies. However, most insurance companies will require you to work with a specified durable medical equipment supplier. Check with your insurance company before purchasing or renting to ensure it will be covered. Your health care provider should be able to assist you with these arrangements.' "
How do I use a home nebulizer?,"'First, you will need the following supplies:''Once you have the necessary supplies:''During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may shake the cup to loosen the droplets.'  Air compressor Nebulizer cup Mask or mouthpiece Medication (either unit dose vials or bottles with measuring devices) Compressor tubing Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight. Plug the cord from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. Before asthma treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the nebulizer cup. Most medications today come in premeasured unit dose vials so measuring is not necessary. If you do measure, use a separate, clean measuring device for each medication. Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece. Connect the tubing to both the aerosol compressor and nebulizer cup. Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly. You should see a light mist coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpiece. Sit up straight on a comfortable chair. If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit on your lap. If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on your or your child's face. If you are using a mouthpiece, place it between your or your child's teeth and seal the lips around it. Take slow, deep breaths. If possible, hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before breathing out. This allows the medication to settle into the airways. Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes). The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little medication remaining. If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes. Continue the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly. If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a problem with future treatments, inform your doctor."
How do I care for my home nebulizer?,"'Cleaning and disinfecting your home nebulizer equipment is simple and very important. Proper care prevents infection. Cleaning should be done in a dust- and smoke-free area away from open windows.''Follow these instructions when cleaning your equipment:''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Pulmonary, ''Allergy'' and Critical Care Medicine.''''Edited by James E. Gerace, MD, December 1, 2006.Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess water, and let air dry. At the end of each day, the nebulizer cup, mask or mouthpiece should be washed in warm soapy water using a mild detergent, rinsed thoroughly, and allowed to air dry. You do not need to clean the compressor tubing. Every third day, after washing your equipment, disinfect the equipment using either a vinegar/water solution or the disinfectant solution your equipment supplier suggests. To use the vinegar solution, mix 1/2 cup white vinegar with 1 1/2 cups of water. Soak the equipment for 20 minutes and rinse well under a steady stream of water. Shake off the excess water and allow to air dry on a paper towel. Always allow the equipment to completely dry before storing in a plastic, zippered bag. Cover the compressor with a clean cloth when not in use. Keep it clean by wiping it with a clean, damp cloth as needed. Do not put the air compressor on the floor either for treatments or for storage. Medications should be stored in a cool, dry place. Check them often. If they have changed color or formed crystals, throw them away and replace them with new ones. Always have an extra nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpiece in case you need it. Check the air compressor's filter as directed. Replace or clean according to the directions from your equipment supplier."
How a Neck Lift Is Done,"'Typically, the procedure will last two to three hours. Of course, if you are having a neck lift in conjunction with liposuction, ''facelift'', brow lift, or other surgeries, the time will vary accordingly. Your exact procedure will depend on your desired results and your own personal circumstances. In order to undergo a neck lift, you must be in good general health, both physically and mentally. '""What do you dislike about your neck? Be honest with yourself! You're putting a lot of time and effort into researching the surgery, so make sure you get the results you want. You also should write down your thoughts on what you'd like to correct and have that with you at the time of your pre-operative consultation.""'Here are some of the most common concerns:' Turkey wattle neck Excess fat Too much skin"
Turkey Wattle; Weakened or Loose Neck Muscles,"'If you have weakened or loose neck muscles, this may cause the ""turkey wattle"" or appearance of neck ""bands."" ''To correct this, your surgeon may recommend platysmaplasty surgery. The surgeon makes incisions under your chin and/or behind your ears to access the platysma (neck muscle) and manipulate it accordingly. Sometimes, that may even mean removing some muscle. Your surgeon may also use permanent ''sutures'' to hold the tissue in place. ''There are new less invasive procedures, where your surgeon may be able to make smaller incisions and use an endoscope (small camera attached to a thin tube) to complete your surgery. Make sure you ask your surgeon for all your options during your consultation. '""You and your surgeon will discuss what type of anesthesia to use, depending on your level of comfort. If you want to remain asleep during the procedure, you should request general anesthesia. Otherwise, your surgeon can use local anesthesia with sedation. It's up to you, however, to make that determination.""'Instead of surgery or in addition to it, ''Botox'' injections can relax parts of the platysma that are responsible for the ""band"" appearance or look of fullness. The injections are completed on an outpatient basis and typically can be completed within 15 minutes.'  "
Excess fat in the neck area,"'During liposuction, your surgeon will make a small incision below the chin and remove the excess fat. If you are undergoing multiple procedures during your neck lift, it is very common for ''plastic'"" surgeons to begin with liposuction.If this is the only procedure you'll need, you should plan to spend up to an hour undergoing the operation. """"You will be able to determine this with your doctor during your pre-operative consultation. Your incisions will be stitched and bandaged. It's very important to follow your doctor's instructions on properly caring for the ""'stitches'' and bandage in the days following surgery. ' "
Too much skin in the neck area,"'Just like the platysmaplasty, your surgeon will make similar incisions for a cervicoplasty, trimming parts of the skin and lifting it into place. ''It will be secured with tissue glue or stitches. The cervicoplasty can be completed in about two to four hours, depending on the complexity of your procedure. Again, your anesthesia will depend on your own personal comfort level. '""Your surgeon will fit you with a compression bandage that you will have to wear for at least one week, unless instructed otherwise. It's important to follow his or her instructions to ensure proper recovery. "" "
How should I prepare for a neck lift?,"'During your consultation, your surgeon will instruct you on what medications to avoid prior to your surgery. Certain medications and ''vitamins'' thin your blood and can cause increased bleeding. ''If you are a smoker, you will need to quit at least two weeks before the surgery and two weeks after. You cannot just plan to cut down. You must not smoke for this time period to ensure proper healing. ''Also, this is no time for a ''diet'': make sure that you eat properly because this will help your body heal. ''Make sure you wear loose, comfortable clothing on the day of surgery. You should especially plan to wear a button-down blouse or shirt that does not have to be pulled over your neck or head. ''You should plan to take at least one week off from work to recover. However, your doctor can determine this based on your personal situation. '""If you are having platysmaplasty, cervicoplasty, or a combination of any of the procedures we've discussed here, you should plan on having a home recovery area set up before you undergo surgery."" Ice packs Gauze and towels Thermometer Supply of comfortable, loose clothing (preferably button down shirts or blouses that do not have to be pulled over your neck and head) Petroleum jelly and antibacterial ointment for incision sites Telephone within reaching distance of where you'll be lying or sitting most of the time Supply of pillows which will allow you to keep your head in a comfortable position Someone who can stay with you at least the first 24 hours after surgery"
What is the expected recovery from a neck lift?,"""Recovery takes time and it's important that you're patient with the process. Most people can return to work in 10-14 days. """"If you participate in other sports or are physically active, you will have to wait at least three weeks, if not longer, to resume those activities. Don't rush! It's not worth it.

What are the complications and side effects of neck lift surgery?,"'You will have swelling and ''bruising'' that can last for several days. You may feel tightness or tingling, and different sensations including burning or pulling. You also will experience numbness. These are all very normal in the first few weeks following surgery and should not be cause for concern. ''As with any surgery, you run the risk of infection. Please keep a watchful eye on your temperature. At the first sign of a ''fever'', contact your doctor. If you have unusual discharge from the incision site, such as pus, contact your doctor immediately. '""Although it's very rare, you could have an ""'allergic reaction'"" to the anesthesia. That's why it's very important to disclose any drug ""'allergies'' to your doctor in a pre-operative consultation.'  "
Does insurance cover this procedure?,"'Insurance carriers are all different, but one thing is the same: They typically agree NOT to cover elective, ''cosmetic surgery''. '""If your procedures will in any way correct a medical condition, it's important that you express this to your insurance carrier. Your surgeon can write a letter detailing your case.""""Also, it's important to realize that cosmetic or ""'plastic surgery'' can affect future coverage under certain insurance carriers.

What is neck pain? What are common causes and risk factors for neck pain?,"'Pain'' located in the neck is a common medical condition. ''Neck pain'' can come from a number of disorders and diseases and can involve any of the tissues in the neck. Examples of common conditions causing neck ''pain'' are ''degenerative disc disease'', neck strain, ''osteoarthritis'', cervical spondylosis, spinal stenosis, poor posture,\xa0''neck injury'' such as in ''whiplash'', a ''herniated disc'', or a ''pinched nerve''\xa0(cervical ''radiculopathy''). Neck pain can come from common infections, such as virus infection of the throat, leading to ''lymph node'' (gland) swelling and neck pain. Neck pain can also come from rare infections, such as ''tuberculosis'' of the neck, infection of the spine bones in the neck (''osteomyelitis'' and septic discitis), and meningitis (often accompanied by ''neck stiffness''). Neck pain can also come from conditions directly affecting the muscles of the neck, such as ''fibromyalgia'' and ''polymyalgia rheumatica'' as well as from uncomfortable positioning of the neck while sleeping with the head on a pillow. Neck pain is also referred to as cervical pain.''Risk factors for neck pain include injury from involvement in contact sports, motor-vehicle accidents, bull or bronco horse riding, etc. ''Prevention'' of neck pain in the context of these activities should include neck strengthening exercises and often neck bracing.'  "
What are other symptoms that are associated with neck pain?,"'Neck pain is a symptom commonly associated with dull aching. Sometimes pain in the neck is worsened with movement of the neck or turning the head. Other symptoms associated with some forms of neck pain include numbness, tingling, tenderness, sharp shooting pain, range-of-motion difficulties, fullness, ''difficulty swallowing'', pulsations, swishing sounds in the head, ''dizziness'' or ''lightheadedness'', and lymph node (gland) swelling.''Neck pain can also be associated with symptoms such as\xa0''headache'', facial pain, ''shoulder pain'', and arm numbness or tingling (upper extremity paresthesias). These associated symptoms are often a result of nerves becoming pinched in the neck. Depending on the condition, sometimes neck pain is accompanied by symptoms such as upper back and/or ''lower back pain'', as is common in inflammation of the spine from ''ankylosing spondylitis''.'  "
What are the structures of the neck?,"'There are seven vertebrae that are the bony building blocks of the spine in the neck (the cervical spine) that surround the spinal cord and canal. Between these vertebrae are discs, and nearby pass the nerves of the neck. Within the neck, structures include the skin, neck muscles, arteries, veins, ''lymph nodes'', thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, ''esophagus'', larynx, and trachea. Diseases or conditions that affect any of these tissues of the neck can lead to neck pain.' "
What specialties of doctors treat neck pain?,"'Doctors who treat neck pain can include general medicine physicians, including family medicine doctors and internists, as well as orthopedists, ''rheumatologists'', neurosurgeons, neurologists, ENT specialists, emergency physicians, physiatrists, and chiropractors. Other ancillary health professionals who treat neck pain include physical therapists, ''massage'' therapists, and acupuncturists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose neck pain?,"'In diagnosing the cause of neck pain, it is important to review the history of the symptoms. In reviewing the medical history, the doctor will note the location, intensity, duration, and ''radiation'' of the pain. Is the pain worsened or improved with turning or repositioning of the head? Any past injury to the neck and past treatments are noted. Aggravating and/or relieving positions or motions are also recorded. The neck is examined at rest and in motion. Tenderness is detected during palpation of the neck. An examination of the nervous system is performed to determine whether or not nerve involvement is present.''Further testing of undiagnosed neck pain can include X-ray evaluation, ''CT scan'', ''bone scan'', ''MRI'' scan, myelogram, and electrical tests such as electromyography (''EMG'') and ''nerve conduction velocity test'' (NCV).' "
What is the treatment for neck pain? What are home remedies for neck pain relief?,"'The treatment of neck pain depends on its precise cause. Treatment options include rest, heat or ''cold'' applications, traction, soft-collar traction, physical therapy (''ultrasound'', massage, manipulation), local injections of cortisone or anesthetics, topical anesthetic creams, topical pain-relief patches, muscle relaxants, ''over-the-counter'' anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', and surgical procedures. Self-care measures for treatment, such as Jacuzzi treatment, neck pain relief exercises and stretches, and neck pain relief products such as neck pillows for ''sleep'' and hot pads can be very beneficial for relief of some forms of neck pain. There are many treatment options, depending on the particular neck problem and past treatment experiences. Alternative treatments that have been used for relief of chronic neck pain include ''acupuncture''.'  "
What is the prognosis for neck pain?,"'The outlook for neck pain depends on the precise cause. Most forms of neck pain can resolve with conservative measures including rest, avoiding reinjury, and gradual rehabilitation.' "
Is it possible to prevent neck pain?,"'Neck pain can really only be prevented by avoiding injury to the neck. This would include minimizing the risks of injury during sports activities. Athletes who participate in collision sports can prevent neck injury with appropriate equipment, neck strengthening exercises, and occasional neck bracing.' "
What is neck pain?,"'Neck pain'' is any degree of discomfort in the front or back of the neck between the head and the shoulders. ''Neck pain'' can feel dull, aching, sharp, piercing, shooting, burning, and may increase or decrease with certain movements of the neck. Neck ''pain'' can range from mild to severe.' "
What is dizziness?,'Dizziness'' can be characterized as either ''vertigo'' with disequilibrium or ''lightheadedness'' associated with feeling faint or the potential to lose consciousness or “pass out.” Poor balance generally accompanies ''dizziness''. Dizziness may or may not be associated with ''pain'' or other symptoms.' 
What are the causes and risk factors of neck pain?,"'Causes of neck pain can include:''Risk factors for neck pain include:'  Injury or trauma Muscle strain Degenerative disc disease Disc herniation and cervical radiculopathy Ligament damage Thyroid disease Lymphadenopathy Fractures Virus infection Bacterial infection Fungus infection Scrofula Carotiditis Tumors Cancer Shingles Burns Trauma injury Athletic activity Whiplash injury Aging Heavy lifting Viral, bacterial, and fungal infections of mouth, throat, or neck"
What are the causes and risk factors of dizziness?,"'Causes of dizziness can include:''Risk factors for dizziness include:'  Dehydration Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Low blood pressure Heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias) Heart attack (myocardial infarction) Anemia Inadequate oxygen supply (hypoxia) Migraine headaches Benign positional vertigo Meniere’s disease Drugs, alcohol or medications Encephalitis Meningitis Stroke Brain tumor or hemorrhage Inner ear infection or tumors Heart disease Aging Diabetes and diseases of the pancreas Inadequate fluid intake Virus infections High altitude exposure Smoking Drugs and alcohol"
What are signs of neck pain and dizziness?,"'Neck pain can be associated with ''stiffness'' or abnormal positioning of the neck, commonly referred to as “wry neck.” There may be pain or worsening of pain with certain movements of the neck. Sometimes there is notable swelling and tenderness of neck tissues such as the muscles or ''lymph nodes'', which may be enlarged. ''Rash'' may be present. Occasionally, neck pain is associated with dizziness.''Dizziness can be associated with poor balance, ''fainting'' or “passing out,” injury, poor speech or motor movement, ''dry mouth'', and other signs.' "
When to seek medical care for neck pain and dizziness,"'With any unexplained or persisting neck pain or dizziness, consult with a health care professional. This is essential to determine whether the symptoms are harmless (benign) and temporary or serious and threatening.''You can often manage common causes of harmless neck pain and dizziness --\xa0including neck ''strains'', viral infections of the mouth and throat, and minor ''dehydration'' -- with home remedies and rehydration. You can use ''over-the-counter'' analgesics, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), rest, topical analgesics, and heat applications for minor pain.' "
What specialists treat conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness?,'Specialists who evaluate and treat the causes of neck pain and dizziness include:' Family practitioners General practitioners Urgent care doctors Emergency physicians Neurologists Internal medicine specialists ENT physicians Neurosurgeons Rheumatologists Orthopedists
How do doctors diagnose conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness?,"'Doctors diagnose the conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness after a history and physical examination, including measuring ''blood pressure'', respiratory rate, and pulse.\xa0Doctors may also perform other tests that include blood testing, ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG''), and imaging tests such as ''X-rays'', ''CT scan'', ''MRI'' scan, and others.'

What are the treatments for conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness?,"'The treatments for the conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness depend on the precise condition involved. Treatments can include:'  Rest Heat application Hydration Blood transfusion Glucose administration Diabetes treatment Oxygen administration Antibiotics Muscle relaxants Analgesics Detoxification Burn care Vertigo treatments Cardiology care Neurosurgery Physical therapy (including ultrasound, electric stimulation, and exercises) Massage Hospitalization"
What is the prognosis for conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness?,"'The prognosis, or outlook, for conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness depends on the specific condition causing the symptom. Because common causes of neck pain and dizziness are often benign, the prognosis for conditions that cause neck pain and dizziness is usually good. However, as listed above, many serious causes of neck pain and dizziness can have a worse prognosis or outlook.' "
How to prevent neck pain and dizziness,"'To some degree, you can prevent neck pain and dizziness by avoiding injury, staying hydrated, getting regular medical checkups, not ''smoking'', and minimizing alcohol intake.' "
What is an autopsy?,"'An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues. In academic institutions, autopsies sometimes are also requested for teaching and research purposes. Forensic autopsies have legal implications and are performed to determine if death was an accident, homicide, ''suicide'', or a natural event. The word autopsy is derived from the Greek word autopsia: ""to see with one\'s own eyes.""' "
Who determines whether an autopsy is performed?,"'A medical examiner can order an autopsy without the consent of the next-of-kin. Deaths that are investigated by the medical examiner or coroner include all suspicious deaths, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include deaths of persons not being treated by a physician for a known medical condition, deaths of those who have been under medical care for less than 24 hours, or deaths that occurred during operations or other medical procedures.''In all other cases, consent must be obtained from the next-of-kin before an autopsy is performed, even at academic institutions or hospitals. The next-of-kin also has the right to limit the scope of the autopsy (for example, excluding the brain from evaluation or limiting the procedure to examination of the abdomen).' "
How is an autopsy performed?,"'The extent of an autopsy can vary from the examination of a single organ such as the ''heart'' or brain, to a very extensive examination. Examination of the chest, abdomen, and brain is probably considered by most pathologists as the standard scope of the autopsy.''The autopsy begins with a complete external examination. The weight and height of the body are recorded, and identifying marks such as ''scars'' and tattoos also are recorded.''The internal examination begins with the creation of a Y or U- shaped incision from both shoulders joining over the sternum and continuing down to the pubic bone. The skin and underlying tissues are then separated to expose the rib cage and abdominal ''cavity''. The front of the rib cage is removed to expose the neck and chest organs. This opening allows the trachea (windpipe), thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, ''esophagus'', heart, thoracic ''aorta'' and ''lungs'' to be removed. Following removal of the neck and chest organs, the abdominal organs are cut (dissected) free. These include the ''intestines'', ''liver'', gallbladder and bile duct system, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, abdominal aorta, and reproductive organs.''To remove the brain, an incision is made in the back of the skull from one ear to the other. The ''scalp'' is cut and separated from the underlying skull and pulled forward. The top of the skull is removed using a vibrating saw. The entire brain is then gently lifted out of the cranial vault. The spinal cord may also be taken by removing the anterior or posterior portion of the spinal column.''The organs are first examined by the pathologist to note any changes visible with the naked eye. Examples of diseases that may produce changes readily recognizable in the organs include ''atherosclerosis'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''coronary artery disease'' in the heart. ''After the organs are removed from the body, they usually are separated from each other and further dissected to reveal any abnormalities, such as tumors, on the inside. Small samples are typically taken from all organs to be made into slide preparations for examination under a microscope. At the end of an autopsy, the incisions made in the body are sewn closed. The organs may be returned to the body or may be retained for teaching, research, and diagnostic purposes. Performance of an autopsy does not interfere with an open casket funeral service, as none of the incisions made in order to accomplish the autopsy are apparent after embalming and dressing of the body by the mortician.' "
What other special studies may be done as part of the autopsy?,"'Pictures of findings may be taken for future reference. Special studies may include cultures to identify infectious agents, chemical analysis for the measurement of drug levels or metabolic abnormalities, or genetic studies. Tissue may be frozen for future diagnostic or research purposes. Organs may be preserved and stored in formalin for later examination, sampling for microscopy, presentation at conferences, or archiving for the training of medical students.' "
What is the autopsy report?,"""After all studies are completed, a detailed report is prepared that describes the autopsy procedure and microscopic findings, gives a list of medical diagnoses, and a summary of the case. The report emphasizes the relationship or correlation between clinical findings (the doctor's examination, laboratory tests, radiology findings, etc.) and pathologic findings (those made from the autopsy)."" "
Why is the autopsy rate declining?,"'Beginning in the 1950s, hospital autopsy rates started falling from an average of around 50% of all deaths to 10% in the late 1990s. Currently, the rates are even lower at non-academic hospitals. In 1970, the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals dropped the requirement that a hospital needed an autopsy rate of 20% to be accredited.''Family factors:'' Certainly the relationship between patients and their doctors has changed dramatically over the past 50 years due to factors such as specialization, managed care, and the disappearance of the ""house call."" Physicians no longer are ""family doctors"" and do not have the same rapport with patients and their families as in past years. This change in the basic doctor-patient relationship may make it increasingly difficult to obtain consent for an autopsy.''Concerns over disfigurement of the remains or delays in funeral arrangements may prevent a vast majority of families from consenting to an autopsy. In reality, however, the visual examination of the body and the removal of tissues and organs for microscopic examination can be completed in a few hours. Furthermore, there are no visible external changes that would preclude an open-casket funeral service.''In the majority of cases and certainly at academic medical centers, there is currently no charge to the family and frequently, no compensation for its performance. More recently, though, some institutions have started to charge and private autopsies at the request of family members that are performed outside of the hospital may cost several thousand dollars.''Clinician factors: ''Most physicians are generally uncomfortable requesting an autopsy because it is not an easy or pleasant task. If, in addition, a physician feels that a family questions the care that their relative was given, the physician may be reluctant to request an autopsy that might prove that the care was indeed incorrect.''Many individuals in medicine feel that modern technology has made the autopsy outdated or obsolete. With modern imaging studies and laboratory tests, it is thought that the autopsy is unlikely to reveal any conditions that were not detected clinically. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis has been the subject of numerous research studies. These studies have consistently shown that in 20% to 40% of autopsied patients, there were important, treatable conditions that were detected at autopsy that were not diagnosed clinically. This consistent and significant discrepancy between clinical and pathologic diagnoses is probably the most compelling argument for continued efforts to revive the autopsy as the ""gold standard"" in evaluating the quality of medical care.''Pathologist factors: ''Some doctors express dissatisfaction with the quality of an autopsy if the pathologist does not provide answers regarding the case. Unfortunately, an autopsy does not guarantee that the cause of death, for example a heart ''arrhythmia'', will be identified.'""Autopsy pathology is a vanishing subspecialty, which, for the most part, has been relegated to a secondary position. At the turn of the century, most of the pathologist's activities revolved around the autopsy. Since that time, laboratory medicine and surgical pathology (examining tissue biopsies from living patients) have become the major activities of practicing pathologists.""'In addition, the autopsy is not one of the favorite activities among the majority of pathologists. For many pathologists, an autopsy is an extra burden with no compensation during a busy day.' "
What are the benefits of autopsies?,"'Benefits for families:'"" For families, the autopsy has both tangible and psychological benefits. Uncertainty regarding the cause of an individual's death can delay payment of insurance benefits. The autopsy can also uncover genetic or environmental (for example, a bacterium or fungus) causes of disease that could affect other family members. Psychologically, the autopsy provides closure by identifying or confirming the cause of death. The autopsy can demonstrate to the family that the care provided was appropriate, thereby alleviating guilt among family members and offering reassurance regarding the quality of medical care. Lastly, the autopsy is a mechanism that enables the family to participate in medical education and research.""'Benefits for the clinician and hospital:'' The procedure can confirm the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses and the appropriateness of medical care. The autopsy findings can be utilized to educate physicians, nurses, residents, and students, thereby contributing to an improved quality of care.''Benefits to society:'' Many of the benefits of the autopsy are experienced by society as a whole. The autopsy aids in the evaluation of new diagnostic tests, the assessment of new therapeutic interventions (''drugs'', devices, surgical techniques), and the investigation of environmental and occupational diseases. Autopsy data are useful in establishing valid mortality statistics. Data derived from death certificates in the absence of autopsy data have repeatedly been shown to be inaccurate. New medical knowledge on existing diseases that is derived from autopsy-based research is clearly important for everyone. Remarkably, new diseases continue to emerge which can only be fully investigated by autopsy.' "
Who pays for autopsies?,"""Presently, there is no direct funding to hospitals or doctors for autopsies. As part of the federal government's Medicare funding to hospitals, reimbursement for autopsies is theoretically included in fixed payments that hospitals receive. Thus, the federal government contends that it is paying for autopsies. Since these funds are not specifically earmarked for autopsies, they may not reach the pathology department or pathologist. Managed care organizations consider the autopsy to be built into their hospital contracts. However, these organizations have stated that they are willing to reimburse for autopsies if and when they are convinced of their value. Sometimes in hospital autopsies performed at the request of physicians, the autopsy is not billed to the patient's family, but they should check with the hospital performing the service. This is different from autopsies the family requests of private pathologists, which may lead to charges billed to the deceased's next-of-kin.""'In our litigation-oriented society, a growing proportion of private-pay autopsies are motivated by distrust, anger, and a desire to sue the potentially responsible physician(s) and hospital. Several groups of pathologists and business persons throughout the country are marketing their autopsy services through direct mail, newspapers, funeral homes, and online. Whether the quality and objectivity of these private autopsies will match those of general hospitals and academic medical centers remains to be determined.' "
What is the history of the autopsy?,"'The earliest anatomists and pathologists could be considered ancient hunters, butchers, and cooks who had to recognize organs and determine if they were suitably edible. In ancient Babylon, perhaps as early as 3500 BC, autopsies on animals were performed not for the study of disease, but rather for the practice of predicting the future by communicating with divine forces. The intestines and liver were believed to contain messages from divine spirits.'""Galen (131-200 A.D.), a disciple of Hippocrates practicing in ancient Greece, performed surgical dismantling (dissection) of animals and humans. He determined that Hippocrates' theory that disease was due to four circulating humours (""'phlegm'', blood, yellow bile, and black bile) was correct. Galen was a highly respected, powerful, and dogmatic individual who dominated the medical thinking of his time and for hundreds of years to follow. It is said that the four humour doctrine paralyzed medical science for about 1400 years.''In general, before 1700 there was a negative attitude regarding dissection of the ''human body''. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and medieval Europeans performed dissections for religious reasons or to learn anatomy, but this was not done in any systematic fashion. There were, however, some notable exceptions. In the late 1200s the law faculty dominated the University of Bologna and would order autopsies to be performed to help solve legal problems. Thus, some of the earliest autopsies were medicolegal cases. In the late 1400s in Padua and Bologna, Italy, the sites of the world\'s first medical schools, Pope Sixtus the IV issued an edict permitting dissection of the human body by medical students. Before such edicts from religious leaders, it was considered a crime to dissect the human body and criminal prosecutions for ""body snatching"" by students of anatomy date back to the early 1300s.''By the 1500s, the autopsy was generally accepted by the Catholic Church, marking the way for an accepted systematic approach for the study of human pathology. While a number of ""giants"" around this time, such as Vesalius (1514-1564), Pare (1510-1590), Lancisi (1654- 1720), and Boerhaave (1668-1738) advanced the autopsy, it is Giovanni Bathista Morgagni (1682-1771) who has been considered the first great autopsist. During his 60 years of observations, Morgagni insisted upon correlation of pathological findings with clinical symptoms, marking the first time that autopsies made major contributions to the understanding of disease in medical science.'""Some historians say that the power of the autopsy in medical education peaked during the 1800s. In the beginning of that century the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Vienna was considered the premiere medical center of the Western World, in large part because of the stature of its Pathology Institute which was headed by Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878). Almost every patient who died was taken to the Rokitansky Institute, which still exists in Vienna, for autopsy. Rokitansky is said to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years. Rokitansky stressed a systematic, almost ritualistic, approach to the autopsy with every patient receiving the same detailed examination. For the sake of objectivity, Rokitansky, unlike Morgagni, did not care to know the clinical history of the patients. Because of this style and his disinclination to apply microscopy in a routine fashion, many of Rokitansky's theories about diseases proved to be incorrect.""'Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902), an eminent German statesman and pathologist, was a younger contemporary and competitor of Rokitansky. Unlike Rokitansky, he grew up with the microscope, and was most influential in the systematic application of microscopy to study disease. Virchow advanced the doctrine which held that cellular pathology was the basis of disease, finally laying to rest the humoural theory of Hippocrates and Galen. In many ways, Virchow could be considered the first molecular biologist. Under Virchow, Berlin replaced Vienna as the premier center of medical education.''Many clinicians, upon returning from study in Berlin, became leaders in North American medicine. The most notable of these physicians was the legendary Sir William Osler, who worked in Canada and the US. Osler was arguably the most respected and revered North American physician of his time. He studied with Rokitansky and Virchow and relied heavily on autopsy studies for his own education. Osler not only performed autopsies himself and taught others from autopsies, but also left detailed instructions for his own autopsy. In speaking of himself, Osler told a friend: ""I\'ve been watching this case for 2 months and I\'m sorry I shall not see the postmortem."" As expected, the autopsy showed that all of Osler\'s diagnoses were correct.''In 1910, Abraham Flexner reported the sorry state of medical education in the U. S. at that time. The Cabot report issued from the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1920, based on approximately 3000 autopsies performed, revealed astonishing diagnostic inaccuracies on the part of clinicians. Resulting medical reforms included the placement of autopsy pathology as a central, integral component of medical education.' "
Should the autopsy be revived?,"'Government agencies that regulate the accreditation of hospitals and ''nursing'' homes are deeply concerned about the decline in autopsy rates. For example, surveys have indicated that less than 1% of nursing home patients who die are autopsied. The U.S. general accounting office, which pays for some nursing home services, recently attempted to prove that particular nursing homes were substandard. Such efforts were thwarted by the lack of hard evidence. The allegations could not be proven because the patients in question were not autopsied and the actual ''causes of death'' could not, therefore, be confirmed.''Some information can only be acquired during an autopsy. The information autopsies can provide benefits society, the medical profession, and families. Many physicians believe that autopsy should be revived. Whether or not it will be revived remains to be seen.' "
What is necrotizing fasciitis?,"'Necrotizing fasciitis'' is a term that describes a disease condition of rapidly spreading infection, usually located in fascial planes of connective tissue that results in tissue necrosis (dead and/or damaged tissue). Fascial planes are bands of connective tissue that surround muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Fascial planes can bind structures together as well as allow body structures to slide over each other effectively. The disease occurs infrequently, but it can occur in almost any area of the body. Although many cases have been caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (''Streptococcus'' pyogenes''), most investigators now agree that many different bacterial genera and species, either alone or together (polymicrobial infections), can cause this disease. Occasionally, mycotic (fungal) species cause necrotizing fasciitis. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a ""flesh eating"" or ""skin eating"" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed ""flesh-eating bacteria"" or ""flesh-eating parasites"" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue.'""Historically, several people described this rapidly advancing condition in the 1840s to 1870s; however, Dr. B. Wilson first termed the condition “necrotizing fasciitis” in 1952. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating bacterial infection or flesh-eating disease; suppurative fasciitis; dermal, Meleney, hospital, or Fournier's ""'gangrene''; and necrotizing ''cellulitis''. Body regions frequently have the term ''necrotizing'' placed before them to describe the initial localization of necrotizing fasciitis (for example, necrotizing ''colitis'', necrotizing arteriolitis), but they all refer to the same disease process in the tissue. Important in understanding necrotizing fasciitis is the fact that whatever the infecting organism(s), once it reaches and grows in connective tissue (fascial planes), the spread of the infection can be so fast (investigators suggest some organisms can progress to involve about 3 centimeters of tissue per hour) that the infection becomes difficult to stop even with both antimicrobial drugs and surgery. Fortunately, this disease is relatively rare; various statistical sources estimate about 500 to 1,500 individuals are reported to have the disease per year in the U.S.'""Statistics show mortality (death) rates have been reported as high as 75% for necrotizing fasciitis associated with Fournier's (scrotal) gangrene, but the mortality in patients with the infection in other regions of the body (for example, legs or arms) is about 25%. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis have an ongoing medical emergency that often leads to death or disability if it is not promptly and effectively treated.""  "
Are there different types of necrotizing fasciitis?,"'Variations of necrotizing fasciitis are placed by some investigators into three general groups or types, roughly based on the type of organisms causing the infection and some clinical findings that vary from patient to patient. Type 1 is either caused by more than one bacterial genera (polymicrobial) or by the infrequently found single bacterial genus such as ''Vibrio'' vulnificus'' or fungal genera such as ''Candida''. Type 2 is caused by ''Streptococcus'' '' bacteria, and type 3 (or termed type 3 ''gas'' gangrene) is caused by ''Clostridium ''bacteria. One example of clinical findings (gas in tissues) is more often found in type 3 but can be found in types 1 and 2 also. Many investigators elect not to use this typing system and simply identify the organism(s) causing the necrotizing fasciitis.' "
What causes necrotizing fasciitis?,"'Bacteria cause most cases of necrotizing fasciitis; only rarely do other organisms such as fungi cause this disease. Group A ''Streptococcus'' and ''Staphylococcus'', either alone or with other bacteria, cause many cases of necrotizing fasciitis, although ''Clostridium '' bacteria should be considered as a cause especially if gas is found in the infected tissue. Because of better microbial isolation techniques for anaerobic (grow in the absence of oxygen) bacteria, bacterial genera such as ''Bacteroides'', ''Peptostreptococcus'', and ''Clostridium'' are often cultured from the infected area. Frequently, culture of tissue involved by necrotizing fasciitis also yields a mixture of other aerobic (require oxygen to grow) bacterial types such as ''E. coli'', ''Klebsiella'', ''Pseudomonas'', and others. Many investigators conclude that non-anaerobic organisms damage tissue areas enough to cause local areas of ''hypoxia'' (reduced oxygen) where anaerobic organisms then can thrive and extend the infection further. This results in polymicrobial infection in which one type of bacteria aids the survival and growth of another type of bacteria (synergy). Infrequently, ''Vibrio vulnificus'' causes the disease when a person, usually someone with ''liver function'' problems (for example, alcoholics or immunosuppressed patients), eats contaminated seafood or a wound gets contaminated with seawater containing ''Vibrio vulnificus''.''Other organisms may rarely cause necrotizing fasciitis, but when they do, the resulting infections are often difficult to treat successfully. For example, ''Aeromonas hydrophila'' (a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium) was the source of this disease in a 24-year-old who cut her thigh in a homemade zip line accident in the U.S. The organism established itself and caused the otherwise healthy young woman to have her leg amputated, and she may suffer further complications over time. Although ''Aeromonas hydrophila'' is usually associated with warm brackish water and causes infections in fish and amphibians, ''gastroenteritis'' is the disease it causes most often in humans when the water sources are swallowed. Because it is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate if it infects human tissues. In addition, once it infects tissues, its enzymes and toxins allow a rapid entrance of the organisms to the bloodstream, causing ''sepsis'' and infection of other body organs.''In general, the bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis utilize similar methods to cause and advance the disease. Most produce toxins that inhibit the immune response, damage or kill tissue, produce tissue hypoxia, specifically dissolve connective tissue, or do all of the above. In polymicrobial infections, one bacterial genus may produce one toxic factor (for example, ''E. coli'' causing tissue hypoxia) while different types of coinfecting bacteria may produce other toxins that lyse (disintegrate) damaged tissue cells or connective tissue. In general, this disease is not contagious, but the organisms that may lead to its development are contagious, usually by direct contact between people or items that can transfer the bacteria. People usually need a break in their skin (cut, ''abrasion'') for these flesh-eating bacteria to cause disease.'  "
Who is at risk to get necrotizing fasciitis?,"'Theoretically, anyone with an infection has a small risk of getting necrotizing fasciitis; the risk factors begin to increase if the infection occurs in immunosuppressed individuals (for example, diabetics, elderly, infants, those with ''liver disease'', or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as chemotherapy for ''cancer''). Visible infections (skin, hair follicles, fingernails, visible ''trauma'' sites) are more likely to be noticed and treated than some deep infections. Patients who have any deep infections (muscle, bone, joint, gastrointestinal) are at somewhat higher risk for the disease because the initial infection and subsequent spread is usually not as noticeable as more visible infections. Although ''pregnant'' women rarely develop the disease, the risk increases in the postpartum period, especially if the mother has ''diabetes'' and has procedures such as cesarean delivery (''C-section'') or ''episiotomy''. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis, but there is still controversy about the cause of this disease.''Necrotizing fasciitis has interesting demographics; more males than females are affected (about three to one), and ''Vibrio vulnificus'' infections seem limited to coastal areas with warm water where the organisms are found associated with seafood and contaminated water.' "
What are necrotizing fasciitis symptoms and signs?,"'The majority of infected individuals who develop necrotizing fasciitis begin with an existing infection (cellulitis, ''abscess'', or wound), most frequently on an extremity or in a wound or surgical site. The initial infection can be from almost any cause (for example, ''cuts'' on the skin, ''puncture wounds'', surgical incisions, or rarely, ''insect bites'' [spiders, biting flies]). Early symptoms may resemble those of cellulitis and include the following:''Progressive or later symptoms include the following:''Necrotizing fasciitis type 1 often occurs after trauma or surgery and may form little or undetectable amounts of gas. Type 2 usually occurs after more simple skin trauma (cuts, abrasions, and ''insect bites'') and infects more superficial facial planes with almost no gas formation. Type 3 usually occurs after trauma or after wounds become contaminated with dirt that contains ''Clostridium'"" bacteria, which produce gas in tissues (gangrene) and necrotic eschars. However, symptoms for types 1-3 are not definitive, and symptoms vary widely which is why some investigators prefer to define individual patients' disease by the organism(s) isolated from the patient rather than assigning a type label.""'One set of patients that is being recognized with a more specific set of symptoms and health history are those infected with ''Vibrio vulnificus''. The organisms occur in the warmer waters in the U.S. (Gulf of Mexico and southern coastal states) and elsewhere in the world with similar water conditions. Either ingesting the organisms or getting ''Vibrio vulnificus'' from contaminated seawater into skin abrasions or cuts can cause necrotizing fasciitis. The majority of those affected is either immunosuppressed or has chronic ''liver'' problems (for example, alcoholic liver disease, ''hepatitis'', or ''cirrhosis''). Bullae formation and rapid progression of the disease (within hours) on the extremities are hallmarks of ''Vibrio vulnificus'' wound infections. Even though a single type of bacteria causes this infection, some investigators classify it as a variant of type 1 necrotizing fasciitis.''Necrotizing enterocolitis (also termed NEC; necrosis of gastrointestinal tissue) occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis. Although investigators suggest that bacterial infection causes this disease, there is no definitive data to prove this and others attribute the disease to a dysfunction of the intestinal tissue.'   Instead of healing, the infected site (see above) can show erythema (redness) and swelling. The site may be very sensitive to pain, and skin pain can occur even past the area of erythema. The presence of pain is far in excess of what would be expected based upon physical findings. Fever and chills Fatigue Progressive skin changes such as skin ulceration and bullae (thin-walled fluid-filled blisters) formation Skin discoloration Necrotic scars (black scabs) Gas formation in the tissues (that can produce a crackling sensation under the skin) Fluid and/or pus draining from the site can occur rapidly as the infection progresses. Some patients can become septic (meaning the infection has spread to the bloodstream and throughout the body) before the skin changes are recognized, especially when flesh-eating disease begins in deep facial planes. Septic shock (bacteremia, low blood pressure, rapid breathing, mental status altered)"
How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis?,"""Often a preliminary diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is based on the patient's symptoms, including the medical and exposure history as described above. For example, a diabetic patient with a rectal fistula who develops pain, swelling, and scrotal skin changes may be preliminarily diagnosed with Fournier's gangrene, while another diabetic patient with liver failure and skin changes (bullae) and exposure to seawater may be preliminarily diagnosed with a ""'Vibrio vulnificus'' infection. Initial treatment is often begun based upon a preliminary diagnosis because waiting for a definitive diagnosis can delay treatment and result in increased morbidity and mortality. Gram staining of exudates (fluid from the infection site) or biopsied tissue may provide the physician clues to determine what organism(s) are causing the infection. For example, the stain can distinguish between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms and further distinguish their shapes (''coccus'' or round, rod, or comma-shaped like ''Vibrio''). Definitive diagnosis depends on isolation of the organism(s) from the patient using both aerobic and anaerobic isolation techniques, and rarely, fungal culture methods.''Organisms isolated from necrotizing fasciitis need to have studies done to determine ''antibiotic resistance'', because many organisms causing the disease are multidrug resistant. A surgeon needs to be consulted early to help obtain tissue samples and to be involved with potential treatment protocols (debridement, amputation). Although ''X-rays'' occasionally show gas in tissues, investigators suggest doing Doppler ''ultrasound'', CT, or ''MRI'' studies to help show gas in tissues and to help delineate the extent of the infection. Most physicians run additional tests such as white blood cell (WBC) counts (elevated in necrotizing fasciitis), BUN (blood urea nitrogen), sodium (decreased in necrotizing fasciitis), and other tests to monitor the patient.'  "
What types of doctors treat necrotizing fasciitis?,"'There are many types of doctors that can be consulted for treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Specialists in ''emergency medicine'', critical care specialists, infectious-disease specialists, and many types of surgeons, depending upon the location of necrotizing fasciitis, should be consulted. For example, testicular involvement would require a urologic surgeon, while necrotizing fasciitis involving the leg may require general surgeon, a ''plastic surgeon'' for skin/''scar'' repair, and for vaginal necrotizing fasciitis, an OB/GYN surgeon.' "
What is the treatment for necrotizing fasciitis?,"'At the time of preliminary diagnosis, the patient needs to be hospitalized and started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics immediately. The initial choice of antibiotics can be made based upon the types of flesh-eating bacteria suspected of causing the infection, but many doctors believe that multiple antibiotics should be used at the same time to protect the patient from methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (''MRSA'', or sometimes termed flesh-eating bacteria in the popular press), as well as infections with anaerobic bacteria, and polymicrobial infections. Antibiotic susceptibility studies, done in the laboratory after the infecting organism(s) has been isolated from the patient, can help the physician choose the best antibiotics to treat the infected individual.'""A surgeon needs to be consulted immediately if necrotizing fasciitis is suspected or preliminarily diagnosed. Surgical drainage and/or debridement of necrotic tissue and collection of tissue samples, needed for culture to identify the infecting organism, are done by a surgeon. The surgeon may also recommend negative pressure wound therapy (vacuum dressing to promote wound healing). The type of surgeon consulted may depend on the area of the body affected; for example, a urologic surgeon would be consulted for Fournier's gangrene. As is the case for immediate antimicrobial therapy, early surgical treatment of most cases of necrotizing fasciitis can reduce morbidity and mortality.""""Many patients with necrotizing fasciitis are very sick, and most require admission to an intensive care unit. Sepsis and organ failure (renal, pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems) need to be treated aggressively to increase the patient's chance for recovery. Treatments such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system may be required. Although not available in many hospitals, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (oxygen given under pressure with the patient in a specialized chamber) is sometimes used in treatment as the oxygen can inhibit or stop anaerobic bacterial growth and promote tissue recovery. This therapy does not replace antibiotics or surgical treatment. However, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown by researchers to further reduce morbidity and mortality by about 10%-20% in some patients when used in conjunction with antibiotics and surgery. Some patients have such extensive damage to limbs that they require skin grafting, ""'plastic surgery'', or even amputation.''The duration of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis is highly variable and often depends upon the extent of the disease and how well the patient responds to treatments. Patients with extensive disease may take months of treatment especially if they need skin grafting and/or ''plastic'' surgery.'  "
Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious?,"'Necrotizing fasciitis does not begin unless an infection has already started in tissue; immediate effective treatment of any infection is likely to prevent the disease. Further, anything that can help prevent infections will help prevent necrotizing fasciitis. Practices such as hand washing, checking extremities for cuts or wounds if you have ''diabetes'', avoiding physical contact with people who carry ''MRSA'', and good hygiene practices help prevent initial infections that may lead to flesh-eating disease. Immunosuppressed patients should be very careful not to get infections, and people with liver disease should avoid eating seafood that may be contaminated with ''Vibrio vulnificus''. People with liver disease should not have any infections or cuts in the skin exposed to warm seawater to avoid necrotizing fasciitis caused by ''Vibrio vulnificus''.''Physicians, surgeons, and other caregivers play an important role in ''prevention''. Cases of necrotizing fasciitis may occur when surgical sites become infected. Consequently, physicians need to use sterile techniques when doing surgery and adhere to hospital practices such as glove and gown coverage to help prevent infection spread in hospitalized patients. Careful surgical techniques in sites that can easily become contaminated are required. Some examples of such sites are bowel surgery, episiotomy (surgically enlarging the vaginal outlet), and debridement with closure of traumatic wounds.''Necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious. However, it is possible for uninfected people to physically come into contact with some patients with the disease and become infected with an organism that may eventually cause necrotizing fasciitis. For example, a person could come in contact with a lesion containing ''MRSA'"" organisms causing or contributing to the disease in another person and then become infected with MRSA. Transmission from one person to another usually requires direct contact with a patient or some item that can transfer organisms like MRSA to another person's skin; infection usually requires a skin break (cut or abrasion) for the organisms to establish an infection (cross-contamination of infected wounds)."" "
What is the prognosis (outcome) for patients with necrotizing fasciitis? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis?,"""Untreated necrotizing fasciitis has a poor prognosis; death or severe morbidity (for example, limb loss) is the frequent outcome. Even with appropriate treatment, the mortality (death) rate can be as high as 25%. Infection with MRSA and other multidrug-resistant organisms tends to have higher morbidity and mortality rates. Combined mortality and morbidity (for example, limb loss, scar formation, renal (kidney) failure, and sepsis) for all cases of necrotizing fasciitis has been reported as 70%-80%. Cases of Fournier's gangrene have reported as high as 75% mortality rates, while cases of ""'Vibrio vulnificus''-associated necrotizing fasciitis have about a 50% mortality rate. Fortunately, ''Vibrio vulnificus'' infection is relatively uncommon, but the incidence seems to be increasing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007, made ''Vibrio vulnificus'' infection a reportable disease so the statistics on the incidence (frequency of occurrence) should be more easily obtained in the future.''The worst complication of this disease is rapid advancement that results in death. Other serious complications include tissue loss requiring surgical removal and amputation to limit disease, as well as sepsis, ''kidney failure'', and extensive scarring.' "

What is jaundice in newborns?,"""Jaundice is the yellow color seen in the skin of many newborns. Jaundice happens when a chemical called bilirubin builds up in the baby's blood. During ""'pregnancy'"", the mother's ""'liver'"" removes bilirubin for the baby, but after birth the baby's liver must remove the bilirubin. In some babies, the liver might not be developed enough to efficiently get rid of bilirubin. When too much bilirubin builds up in a new baby's body, the skin and whites of the eyes might look yellow. This yellow coloring is called jaundice.""  "
What is kernicterus?,"""When severe jaundice goes untreated for too long, it can cause a condition called kernicterus. Kernicterus is a type of brain damage that can result from high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood. It can cause athetoid ""'cerebral palsy'' and ''hearing loss''. Kernicterus also causes problems with vision and ''teeth'' and sometimes can cause intellectual disabilities. Early detection and management of jaundice can prevent kernicterus.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of jaundice in newborns?,"""Jaundice usually appears first on the face and then moves to the chest, belly, arms, and legs as bilirubin levels get higher. The whites of the eyes can also look yellow. Jaundice can be harder to see in babies with darker skin color. The baby's doctor or nurse can test how much bilirubin is in the baby's blood."" "
When should I contact my doctor if I think my newborn has jaundice?,"""See your baby's doctor the same day if your baby:""""Make sure your baby is getting enough to eat. The process of removing waste also removes bilirubin in your baby's blood. If you are breastfeeding, you should nurse the baby at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first few days. This will help you make enough milk for the baby and will help keep the baby's bilirubin level down. If you are having trouble breastfeeding, ask your doctor, nurse, or a lactation coach for help."" Is very yellow or orange (skin color changes start from the head and spread to the toes). Is hard to wake up or will not sleep at all. Is not 
		breastfeeding or sucking from a bottle well. Is very fussy. Does not have enough wet or dirty diapers. If you think your baby has jaundice you should call and visit your baby's doctor right away. Ask your baby's doctor or nurse about a jaundice bilirubin test.

When should I get emergency medical help if I think my newborn has jaundce?,"'Get emergency medical help if your baby:' Is crying inconsolably or with a high pitch. Is arched like a bow (the head or neck and heels are bent backward and the body forward). Has a stiff, limp, or floppy body. Has strange eye movements."
How is newborn jaundice diagnosed?,"'Before leaving the hospital with your ''newborn'', you can ask the doctor or nurse about a jaundice bilirubin test.'""A doctor or nurse may check the baby's bilirubin using a light meter that is placed on the baby's head. This results in a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) level. If it is high, a blood test will likely be ordered.""""The best way to accurately measure bilirubin is with a small blood sample from the baby's heel. This results in a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level. If the level is high, based upon the baby's age in hours and other risk factors, treatment will likely follow. Repeat blood samples will also likely be taken to ensure that the TSB decreases with the prescribed treatment.""'Bilirubin levels are usually the highest when the baby is 3 to 5 days old. At a minimum, babies should be checked for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours of life and again before 5 days of age.' "
What is the treatment for newborn jaundice?,"'No baby should develop brain damage from untreated jaundice.'""When being treated for high bilirubin levels, the baby will be undressed and put under special lights. The lights will not hurt the baby. This can be done in the hospital or even at home. The baby's milk intake may also need to be increased. In some cases, if the baby has very high bilirubin levels, the doctor will do a blood exchange transfusion. Jaundice is generally treated before brain damage is a concern.""'Putting the baby in sunlight is not recommended as a safe way of treating jaundice.' "
What are the risk factors for newborn jaundice?,"'About 60% of all babies have jaundice. Some babies are more likely to have severe jaundice and higher bilirubin levels than others. Babies with any of the following risk factors need close monitoring and early jaundice management:''Babies born before 37 weeks, or 8.5 months, of pregnancy might have jaundice because their liver is not fully developed. The young liver might not be able to get rid of so much bilirubin.''Jaundice may be missed or not recognized in a baby with darker skin color. Checking the gums and inner lips may detect jaundice. If there is any doubt, a bilirubin test should be done.''A baby born to an East Asian or Mediterranean family is at a higher risk of becoming jaundiced. Also, some families inherit conditions (such as ''G6PD deficiency''), and their babies are more likely to get jaundice.''A baby who is not eating, wetting, or stooling well in the first few days of life is more likely to get jaundice.''A baby with a sister or brother that had jaundice is more likely to develop jaundice.''A baby with ''bruises'' at birth is more likely to get jaundice. A bruise forms when blood leaks out of a blood vessel and causes the skin to look black and blue. The healing of large ''bruises'' can cause high levels of bilirubin and your baby might get jaundice.''Women with an O blood type or Rh negative blood factor might have babies with higher bilirubin levels. A mother with Rh incompatibility should be given Rhogam.'  When severe jaundice goes untreated for too long, it can cause brain damage and a condition called kernicterus. Early diagnosis and treatment of jaundice can prevent kernicterus. If you're concerned that your baby might have jaundice visit your baby's doctor right away. Ask for a jaundice bilirubin test."
What to do before leaving the hospital,"'Some babies with jaundice might look yellow or even orange, but it is not possible to see jaundice in all babies, especially those with darker skin color.

Babies with jaundice in the first 24 hours of life or with high bilirubin levels before hospital discharge should have an early follow-up plan. ""'''T''reat jaundice seriously.' "
What do I do if my baby has jaundice?,"'It is important to take jaundice seriously and stick to the follow-up plan for appointments and recommended care.''Your baby might be put under special blue lights (phototherapy) to lower the bilirubin level.

What is thymoma?,"'A thymoma is a rare type of tumor of the thymus gland. The thymus is a gland located in the anterior mediastinum (the area between the two lungs and the sternum in the chest) that plays a critical role in the development of immune cells (lymphocytes) during childhood. The thymus gland enlarges during childhood, peaks in size at puberty (about 40 grams), and then begins to shrink.''Normally, a combination of lymphoid cells (immune cells or lymphocytes) and lining cells (epithelial cells) makes up the thymus. Thymoma is a type of tumor that originates from the epithelial or lining cells of the thymus. The term ''thymic neoplasms'' refers to tumors of the thymus, which consist of thymomas and thymic carcinomas. The term ''thymoma'' refers to tumors of the thymus that grow slowly and usually do not spread beyond the thymus. Thymic carcinomas are tumors of the thymus that grow aggressively and may ''metastasize'' to distant organs. Less than one person per 1.5 million people will develop a thymoma. This means about 400 people per year in the U.S. develop thymoma. Thymic carcinomas are very rare and make up only 0.06% of all thymic tumors.' "
"What causes thymoma, and what are risk factors for thymoma?",'The exact cause of thymomas is unknown. Thymomas are equally common in men and in women and are most frequently seen in the fourth and fifth decades of life. There are no known risk factors that predispose a person to developing thymoma.' 
What are signs and symptoms of thymoma?,"'Up to 50% of thymomas are asymptomatic, meaning they do not produce any symptoms or signs. Physicians may diagnose a thymoma when they perform an imaging study for another reason. In other cases, the tumor may cause symptoms related to the size of the tumor and the pressure it exerts on adjacent organs.''The following symptoms and signs are less common but may occur:''Some cases may spread to the lining of the lungs or heart or even to tissues outside the chest. Less than 7% of cases spread outside the chest cavity. Thymic carcinomas are more aggressive types of tumors than thymomas and are more likely to spread both locally and distantly (metastasize) and to cause symptoms.'   Chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough are common symptoms when symptoms do occur. Fever Night sweats Weight loss"
What other types of medical conditions are associated with thymoma?,"'A number of health conditions have been associated with thymoma. Medical conditions associated with ''cancers'' are paraneoplastic syndromes, and up to 50%-60% of patients with thymoma will have one of these related health conditions. The most commonly associated condition with thymoma is myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease of the nerve-muscle junction that can manifest as ''weakness'', ''fatigue'', ''double vision'', ''ptosis'' (drooping eyelids), and problems with swallowing.''Other associated conditions include other autoimmune diseases including pure red cell aplasia (underproduction of ''red blood cells'' in the bone marrow).' "
What types of specialists treat thymomas?,"'Surgeons, including thoracic (chest) surgeons and surgical oncologists, typically treat thymoma. Medical oncologists and ''radiation'' oncologists may be involved in the treatment team if other treatments indicate an aggressive thymoma or thymic carcinoma.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a thymoma?,"'If a thymoma is not causing symptoms, health care professionals may identify it incidentally, meaning it is found on an imaging test of the chest (for example, X-ray, ''computerized tomography'' or ''CT scan'') that is performed for another reason. If symptoms are present, health care providers may carry out chest ''X-rays'' or other imaging studies, such as ''CT scans'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scans or the combination of PET and CT scans, to identify the source of the symptoms.''While a mass in the anterior mediastinum can be seen on imaging studies, the definitive diagnosis can only be established when the mass is either removed surgically and examined by a pathologist or when a biopsy (surgical removal of a small portion of tissue for diagnostic purposes) is taken. Microscopic examination of the tumor biopsy tissue is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of thymoma or thymic carcinoma. Health care professionals classify the appearance of the tissue itself under the microscope as type A, B, or C based on its characteristics. Type C thymoma is thymic carcinoma and is quite rare.'  "
What are the stages of thymoma?,"'The stage of a tumor refers to the extent to which it has spread to other local organs and tissues or to other parts of the body. There are two commonly used staging systems for thymoma, both of which classify the tumors as stage 1 through stage 4, depending upon the extent of spread and the degree of tissue invasion. While there are some differences in the two methods used to stage thymomas, a stage 1 tumor represents an encapsulated tumor (surrounded by a capsular structure) that has not spread outside of the thymus gland. Stage 4 represents the opposite extreme, in which invasion and spread to distant organs has occurred. Locally recurrent thymoma refers to the situation in which a tumor returns in the same area after its surgical removal.' "
What are types of treatment options for thymoma?,"'Surgery is the primary treatment for thymoma. The success of the surgery depends upon the particular characteristics of the tumor and its precise location; tumors have a higher surgical cure rate if physicians can remove them completely. If all evidence of disease is unable to be removed and microscopic, or tumor remains after surgery, then radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy ''drugs'' have been used in addition to surgical resection.'  "
What is the prognosis for thymoma?,"'The prognosis (outcome) for thymoma is dependent upon the stage of the tumor as well as the ability to remove the tumor by surgery. Thymic carcinomas tend to behave more aggressively and have a worse prognosis than thymomas. Thymomas tend to be slow-growing tumors, and the prognosis is good to excellent for those with stage 1 or stage 2 thymoma. It is hard to estimate exact survival statistics based on stage because of the low numbers of people diagnosed with this tumor. In a German study of patients whose thymomas were completely removed by surgery, only 3% of the tumors recurred. Even 83% of patients with stage 3 thymoma were alive 10 years after diagnosis. The 10-year survival rate for stage 4 thymoma is approximately 47%. Overall, a majority of thymoma patients will live at least five years, while fewer than half or those with thymic carcinoma are expected to live that long.' "
Is it possible to prevent a thymoma?,"'Because the cause of thymoma is unknown and no risk factors have been identified, prevention of thymoma is not possible.' "
What is a kidney stone (nephrolithiasis)?,"'A kidney stone is a hard, crystalline mineral material formed within the kidney or urinary tract. Kidney stones are a common cause of ''blood in the urine'' (hematuria) and often severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones are sometimes called renal calculi.''The condition of having kidney stones is termed nephrolithiasis. Having stones at any location in the urinary tract is referred to as urolithiasis, and the term ureterolithiasis is used to refer to stones located in the ureters.' "
Who is at risk for kidney stones?,"'Anyone may develop a kidney stone, but people with certain diseases and conditions (see below) or those who are taking certain medications are more susceptible to their development. Urinary tract stones are more common in men than in women. Most urinary stones develop in people 20 to 49 years of age, and those who are prone to multiple attacks of kidney stones usually develop their first stones during the second or third decade of life. People who have already had more than one kidney stone are prone to developing further stones.''In residents of industrialized countries, kidney stones are more common than stones in the bladder. The opposite is true for residents of developing areas of the world, where bladder stones are the most common. This difference is believed to be related to dietary factors. People who live in the southern or southwestern regions of the U.S. have a higher rate of kidney stone formation, possibly due to inadequate water intake leading to ''dehydration'', than those living in other areas. Over the last few decades, the percentage of people with kidney stones in the U.S. has been increasing, most likely related to the ''obesity'' epidemic.''A family history of kidney stones is also a risk factor for developing kidney stones. Kidney stones are more common in Asians and Caucasians than in Native Americans, Africans, or African Americans.''Uric acid kidney stones are more common in people with chronically elevated uric acid levels in their blood (''hyperuricemia'').''A small number of ''pregnant'' women develop kidney stones, and there is some evidence that ''pregnancy''-related changes may increase the risk of stone formation. Factors that may contribute to stone formation during pregnancy include a slowing of the passage of urine due to increased ''progesterone'' levels and diminished fluid intake due to a decreasing bladder capacity from the enlarging uterus. Healthy pregnant women also have a mild increase in their urinary calcium excretion. However, it remains unclear whether the changes of pregnancy are directly responsible for kidney stone formation or if these women have another underlying factor that predisposes them to kidney stone formation.' "
What causes kidney stones?,"'Kidney stones form when there is a decrease in urine volume and/or an excess of stone-forming substances in the urine. The most common type of kidney stone contains calcium in combination with either oxalate or phosphate. A majority of kidney stones are calcium stones. Other chemical compounds that can form stones in the urinary tract include uric acid, magnesium ammonium phosphate (which forms struvite stones; see below), and the amino acid cysteine.''Dehydration from reduced fluid intake or strenuous ''exercise'' without adequate fluid replacement increases the risk of kidney stones. Obstruction to the flow of urine can also lead to stone formation. In this regard, climate may be a risk factor for kidney stone development, since residents of hot and dry areas are more likely to become dehydrated and susceptible to stone formation.''Kidney stones can also result from infection in the urinary tract. These are known as struvite or infection stones. Metabolic abnormalities, including ''inherited'"" disorders of metabolism, can alter the composition of the urine and increase an individual's risk of stone formation. ""

  "
Other medical conditions which cause kidney stones,"'A number of different medical conditions can lead to an increased risk for developing kidney stones:' Gout results in chronically increased amount of uric acid in the blood and urine and can lead to the formation of uric acid kidney stones. Hypercalciuria (high calcium in the urine), another inherited condition, causes stones in more than half of cases. In this condition, too much calcium is absorbed from food and excreted into the urine, where it may form calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate kidney stones. Other conditions associated with an increased risk of kidney stones include hyperparathyroidism, kidney diseases such as renal tubular acidosis, and other inherited metabolic conditions, including cystinuria and hyperoxaluria. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) are also associated with an increased risk of developing kidney stones. People with inflammatory bowel disease are also more likely to develop kidney stones. Those who have undergone intestinal bypass or ostomy surgery are also at increased risk for kidney stones. Some medications also raise the risk of kidney stones. These medications include some diuretics, calcium-containing antacids, and the protease inhibitor indinavir (Crixivan), a drug used to treat HIV infection. Dietary factors and practices may increase the risk of stone formation in susceptible individuals. In particular, inadequate fluid intake predisposes to dehydration, which is a major risk factor for stone formation. Other dietary practices that may increase an individual's risk of forming kidney stones include a high intake of animal protein, a high-salt diet, excessive sugar consumption, excessive vitamin D supplementation, and excessive intake of oxalate-containing foods such as spinach. Interestingly, low levels of dietary calcium intake may alter the calcium-oxalate balance and result in the increased excretion of oxalate and a propensity to form oxalate stones. Hyperoxaluria as an inherited condition is uncommon and is known as primary hyperoxaluria. The elevated levels of oxalate in the urine increase the risk of stone formation. Primary hyperoxaluria is much less common than hyperoxaluria due to dietary factors as mentioned above."
What are the early signs and symptoms of kidney stones?,"'While some kidney stones may not produce symptoms (known as ""silent"" stones), people who have kidney stones often report the sudden onset of excruciating, cramping pain in their low back and/or side, groin, or abdomen. Changes in body position do not relieve this pain. The abdominal, groin, and/or ''back pain'' typically waxes and wanes in severity, characteristic of colicky pain (the pain is sometimes referred to as renal ''colic''). It may be so severe that it is often accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. The pain has been described by many as the worst pain of their lives, even worse than the pain of ''childbirth'' or broken bones. Kidney stones also characteristically cause ''bloody urine''. If infection is present in the urinary tract along with the stones, there may be ''fever'' and ''chills''. Sometimes, symptoms such as ''difficulty urinating'', ''urinary urgency'', ''penile pain'', or ''testicular pain'' may occur due to kidney stones.'

  "
How are kidney stones diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of kidney stones is suspected when the typical pattern of symptoms is noted and when other possible causes of the abdominal or flank pain are excluded. Which is the ideal test to diagnose kidney stones is controversial. Imaging tests are usually done to confirm the diagnosis. Many patients who go to the emergency room will have a non-contrast CT scan done. This can be done rapidly and will help rule out other causes for flank or ''abdominal pain''. However, a CT scan exposes patients to significant ''radiation'', and recently, ultrasound in combination with plain abdominal ''X-rays'' have been shown to be effective in diagnosing kidney stones.''In pregnant women or those who should avoid radiation exposure, an ultrasound examination may be done to help establish the diagnosis. ' "
What is the treatment for kidney stones? How long does it take to pass a kidney stone?,"'Most kidney stones eventually pass through the urinary tract on their own within 48 hours, with ample fluid intake. ''Ketorolac'' (''Toradol''), an injectable anti-inflammatory drug, and narcotics may be used for pain control when ''over-the-counter'' pain control medications are not effective. Toradol, ''aspirin'', and ''NSAIDs'' must be avoided if lithotripsy is to be done because of the increased risk of bleeding or if there is impaired kidney function. Intravenous pain medications can be given when ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' are present.''Although there are no proven home remedies to dissolve kidney stones, home treatment may be considered for patients who have a known history of kidney stones. Since most kidney stones, given time, will pass through the ureter to the bladder on their own, treatment is directed toward control of symptoms. Home care in this case includes the consumption of plenty of fluids. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') may be used as pain medication if there is no contraindication to its use. If further pain medication is needed, stronger narcotic pain medications may be recommended.''There are several factors that influence the ability to pass a stone. These include the size of the person, prior stone passage, ''prostate enlargement'', pregnancy, and the size of the stone. A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. Stones larger than 9 mm to 10 mm rarely pass without specific treatment.''Some medications have been used to increase the passage rates of kidney stones. These include ''calcium channel blockers'' such as ''nifedipine'' (Adalat, ''Procardia'', ''Afeditab'', ''Nifediac'') and alpha blockers such as ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax''). These ''drugs'' may be prescribed to some people who have stones that do not rapidly pass through the urinary tract.''For kidney stones that do not pass on their own, a procedure called lithotripsy is often used. In this procedure, ''shock'' waves are used to break up a large stone into smaller pieces that can then pass through the urinary system.''Surgical techniques have also been developed to remove kidney stones when other treatment methods are not effective. This may be done through a small incision in the skin (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or through an instrument known as an ureteroscope passed through the urethra and bladder up into the ureter.'

Can kidney stones be prevented?,"'Rather than having to undergo treatment, it is best to avoid kidney stones in the first place when possible. It can be especially helpful to drink more water, since low fluid intake and dehydration are major risk factors for kidney stone formation.'""Depending on the cause of the kidney stones and an individual's medical history, changes in the diet or medications are sometimes recommended to decrease the likelihood of developing further kidney stones. If one has passed a stone, it can be particularly helpful to have it analyzed in a laboratory to determine the precise type of stone so specific ""'prevention'' measures can be considered.''People who have a tendency to form calcium oxalate kidney stones may be advised to limit their consumption of foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, Swiss chard, beets, wheat germ, and peanuts. Also drinking lemon juice or lemonade may be helpful in preventing kidney stones.'  "
What is the prognosis for kidney stones?,"'Most kidney stones will pass on their own, and successful treatments have been developed to remove larger stones or stones that do not pass. People who have had a kidney stone remain at risk for future stones throughout their lives.' "
Are home remedies effective for kidney stones?,"'For some people who have had many kidney stones, home care may be appropriate. When passing a kidney stone, drinking lots of fluid is important. In fact, this is the most important home care measure. Medications may help control the pain (as described previously). However, if it is the first time one has had symptoms suggestive of a kidney stone, it is important to see a doctor right away. ' "
Introduction to high blood pressure and kidney disease,"""The kidneys play a key role in keeping a person's blood pressure in a healthy range, and blood pressure, in turn, can affect the health of the kidneys. High blood pressure, also called ""'hypertension'', can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD).'  "
What is high blood pressure?,"'Blood pressure measures the force of blood against the walls of the blood vessels. Extra fluid in the body increases the amount of fluid in blood vessels and makes blood pressure higher. Narrow, stiff, or clogged blood vessels also raise blood pressure.''People with high blood pressure should see their doctor regularly.' "
How does high blood pressure hurt the kidneys?,"""High blood pressure makes the heart work harder and, over time, can damage blood vessels throughout the body. If the blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged, they may stop removing wastes and extra fluid from the body. The extra fluid in the blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more. It's a dangerous cycle.""'High blood pressure is one of the leading causes of ''kidney failure'', also called ''end-stage renal disease'' (''ESRD''). People with kidney failure must either receive a ''kidney transplant'' or have regular blood-cleansing treatments called ''dialysis''. Every year, high blood pressure causes more than 25,000 new cases of kidney failure in the United States.''1''1''United States Renal Data System. USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report. Bethesda, MD: National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; 2007.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of high blood pressure?,"'Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms. The only way to know whether a person\'s blood pressure is high is to have a health professional measure it with a blood pressure cuff. The result is expressed as two numbers. The top number, called the systolic pressure, represents the pressure when the heart is beating. The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, shows the pressure when the heart is resting between beats. A person\'s blood pressure is considered normal if it stays at or below 120/80, which is commonly stated as ""120 over 80."" People with a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 are considered prehypertensive and should adopt lifestyle changes to lower their blood pressure and prevent heart and blood vessel diseases. A person whose systolic blood pressure is consistently 140 or higher or whose diastolic pressure is 90 or higher is considered to have high blood pressure and should talk with a doctor about the best ways to lower it.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD)?,"""Early kidney disease is a silent problem, like high blood pressure, and does not have any symptoms. People may have CKD but not know it because they do not feel sick. A person's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering wastes from the blood. GFR is estimated from a routine measurement of creatinine in the blood. The result is called the estimated GFR (eGFR).""'Creatinine is a waste product formed by the normal breakdown of muscle cells. Healthy kidneys take creatinine out of the blood and put it into the urine to leave the body. When the kidneys are not working well, creatinine builds up in the blood.'""An eGFR with a value below 60 milliliters per minute (mL/min) suggests some kidney damage has occurred. The score means that a person's kidneys are not working at full strength.""'Another sign of CKD is ''proteinuria'', or ''protein in the urine''. Healthy kidneys take wastes out of the blood but leave protein. Impaired kidneys may fail to separate a blood protein called albumin from the wastes. At first, only small amounts of albumin may leak into the urine, a condition known as microalbuminuria, a sign of failing kidney function. As kidney function worsens, the amount of albumin and other proteins in the urine increases, and the condition is called proteinuria. CKD is present when more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine is excreted in urine, with or without decreased eGFR.'  "
How can kidney damage from high blood pressure be prevented?,"'The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recommends that people with CKD use whatever therapy is necessary, including lifestyle changes and medicines, to keep their blood pressure below 130/80.' "
How can blood pressure be controlled?,"'The NHLBI recommends five lifestyle changes that help control blood pressure. People with ''prehypertension'' or high blood pressure should' Weight: maintain their weight at a level close to normal Diet: eat fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and low-fat dairy foods. Sodium: limit their daily salt, or sodium, intake to 2,000 milligrams. They should limit frozen foods and trips to fast food restaurants. They should read nutrition labels on packaged foods to learn how much sodium is in one serving. Keeping a sodium diary can help monitor sodium intake. Exercise: get plenty of exercise-at least 30 minutes of moderate activity, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, most days of the week. Alcohol: avoid consuming too much alcohol. Men should have no more than two drinks-two 12-ounce servings of beer or two 5-ounce servings of wine or two 1.5-ounce servings of hard liquor-a day. Women should have no more than a single serving a day because differences in the way foods are broken down in the body make women more sensitive to the effects of alcohol."
Can medicines help control blood pressure?,"'Many people need medicine to control high blood pressure. Several effective blood pressure medicines are available. The most common types of blood pressure medicines doctors prescribe are diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''), ''beta blockers'', and ''calcium channel blockers''. Two of these medicines, the ''ACE inhibitors'' and ARBs, have an added protective effect on the kidneys. Studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney damage. Diuretics, also known as ""water pills,"" help a person urinate and get rid of excess fluid in the body. A combination of two or more blood pressure medicines may be needed to keep blood pressure below 130/80.' "
Who is at risk for kidney failure related to high blood pressure?,"'Everyone has some risk of developing kidney failure from high blood pressure. African Americans, however, are more likely than Caucasians to have high blood pressure and its related kidney problems - even when their blood pressure is only mildly elevated. In fact, African Americans are six times more likely than Caucasians to develop ''hypertension''-related kidney failure.''2''People with ''diabetes'' also have a greater risk of developing kidney failure. Early management of high blood pressure is especially important for African Americans with diabetes.''The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), also part of the NIH, sponsored the African American Study of Kidney Disease and ''Hypertension'' (AASK) to find effective ways to prevent high blood pressure and kidney failure in this population. The results, published in the November 20, 2002, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that an ACE inhibitor was the most effective drug at slowing the progression of kidney disease in African Americans. While ACE inhibitors help reduce the risk of kidney disease, they are less effective in ''lowering blood pressure'' in African Americans than in Caucasians.''2''United States Renal Data System. USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report. Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; 2007.' "

What is a nephrostomy?, 
Why is a nephrostomy performed?,'Your doctor may recommend you a nephrostomy if' You have an obstruction in the urinary flow. The size of your kidney stone is very large. The treatment for kidney stone fails to relieve your pain (renal colic). You get frequent urine infections due to the kidney stone. Your kidneys are getting damaged due to the kidney stone.
What is done before a nephrostomy?,"'Tell your doctor if you are on any medications such as blood-thinning ones (''Aspirin'' and ''warfarin''), any herbs, and ''supplements''. You may be asked to discontinue them a few days before the surgery.''Inform your doctor if you are or think you could be ''pregnant''.''Your doctor may ask you to fast a night before a nephrostomy (in case of general anesthesia).' "
How is a nephrostomy performed?,"'The nephrostomy procedure may be performed by either a ''urologist'' or radiologist. A urologist is a doctor who is specialized in treating disorders of the urinary tract, whereas a radiologist is a doctor who has specialization in diagnosing and treating diseases using medical imaging procedures such as ''X-rays'', computed tomography (CT) scans, and so on.''You will be given ''sedatives'' or local anesthetic medication to make the surgical area numb. Alternatively, the doctor can plan to give you general anesthesia that makes you numb throughout the procedure.''Next, the doctor inserts a needle into your back. They make use of an X-ray or ''ultrasound'' to check if the needle has been inserted properly to reach the kidney. They then insert a wire through this needle. The nephrostomy tube is inserted over this wire. A contrast (X-ray dye) may be injected through this tube, and an X-ray will be taken to check if the tube has been placed correctly. Instead of an X-ray, an ultrasound may be used. Next, the wire is removed, and the tube is properly fixed in its position into the kidney. Doctors use ''stitches'' or dressings to secure the tube on the skin. The tube is attached to a bag for collecting the urine. The bag is generally strapped to your legs.' "
What are the complications of the nephrostomy procedure?,'A nephrostomy procedure is generally safe. Possible risks include:' Hemorrhage (bleeding) Kidney infection Kidney damage Tube blockage Damage to the structures (during the surgery) Allergic reaction to contrast injection
Introduction,"'Nerve blocks are used for ''pain'' treatment and management. There are several different types of nerve blocks that serve different purposes.''Often a group of nerves, called a plexus or  ''ganglion'', that causes ''pain'' to a specific organ or body region can be blocked with the injection of medication into a specific area of the body. The injection of this nerve-numbing substance is called a nerve block.' "
How Are Nerve Blocks Used?,"'Different kinds of nerve blocks are used for different purposes.' Therapeutic nerve blocks are used to treat painful conditions. Such nerve blocks contain local anesthetic that can be used to control acute pain. Diagnostic nerve blocks are used to determine sources of pain. These blocks typically contain an anesthetic with a known duration of relief. Prognostic nerve blocks predict the outcomes of given treatments. For example, a nerve block may be performed to determine if more permanent treatments (such as surgery) would be successful in treating pain. Preemptive nerve blocks are meant to prevent subsequent pain from a procedure that can cause problems including phantom limb pain.  Nerve blocks can be used, in some cases, to avoid surgery."
Types of Nerve Blocks,"'Various areas of pain require different nerve block types. Below are a few of the available nerve blocks, followed in parentheses by some of the parts of the body for which they are used.' Trigeminal nerve blocks (face) Ophthalmic nerve block (eyelids and scalp) Supraorbital nerve block (forehead) Maxillary nerve block (upper jaw) Sphenopalatine nerve block (nose and palate) Cervical epidural, thoracic epidural, and lumbar epidural block (neck and back) Cervical plexus block and cervical paravertebral block (shoulder and upper neck) Brachial plexus block, elbow block, and wrist block (shoulder/arm/hand, elbow, and wrist) Subarachnoid block and celiac plexus block (abdomen and pelvis)"
Other Nerve Blocks,"'Other types of nerve blocks include:' Sympathetic nerve block: A sympathetic nerve block is one that is performed to determine if there is damage to the sympathetic nerve chain. This is a network of nerves extending the length of the spine. These nerves control some of the involuntary functions of the body, such as opening and narrowing blood vessels.
   Stellate ganglion block: 
  This is a type of sympathetic nerve block performed to determine if there is damage to the sympathetic nerve chain supplying the head, neck, chest, or arms and if it is the source of pain in those areas. Although used mainly as a diagnostic block, the stellate ganglion block may provide pain relief in excess of the duration of the anesthetic. Facet joint block: Also known as a zygapophysial joint block, the facet joint block is performed to determine whether a facet joint is a source of pain. Facet joints are located on the back of the spine, where one vertebra slightly overlaps another. These joints guide and restrict the spines movement."
Side Effects and Risks of Nerve Blocks,"'Nerve blocks do have risks and side effects. They include:'""Although many kinds of nerve blocks exist, this treatment cannot always be used. If your pain isn't related to pain in a single or small group of nerves, nerve blocks may not be right for you. Your doctor can advise you as to whether this treatment is appropriate for you.""'WebMD Medical Reference' Elevated blood sugars Rash Itching Weight gain Extra energy Soreness at the site of injection Bleeding Death (in rare cases)"
What are electromyography and nerve conduction studies?,"'Nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography (''EMG'') are tests performed to assess the health of nerves and muscles. A neurophysiologist stimulates specific nerves and muscles and studies the resulting activity to evaluate if the nerves and muscles are functioning normally.''A thin needle electrode is inserted into the muscle. The muscle’s electrical activity displays on the EMG’s monitoring device, highlighting to doctors important functional information such as:''Nerve conduction studies are performed with electrodes placed on the skin to stimulate specific nerves. A mild electric impulse stimulates the nerve, and the resulting neural activity demonstrates how well the nerves are conducting' Response to electrode insertion Spontaneous electrical activity during rest Electrical activity during voluntary muscle movement Signals of sensation from the tissues to the brain Signals from the brain to the muscles to function "
What is the difference between EMG and nerve conduction studies?,"'An EMG test is used to assess if a muscle functions normally when stimulated by its nerve, while nerve conduction studies are performed to test if specific nerves function normally.' "
Why are EMG and nerve conduction studies performed?,"'EMG and nerve conduction studies are commonly performed together to diagnose whether a neuromuscular disorder is caused by muscle or nerve damage, in order to accurately diagnose and provide appropriate treatment. These tests are generally performed only when physical examination does not reveal the cause of the disease.''An EMG and nerve conduction studies may be performed when a person has unexplained neuromuscular symptoms such as:''EMG and nerve conduction studies are not performed on people who have''EMG and nerve conduction studies are performed with caution in people who have implanted electrical devices such as:' Muscle cramps and pains Tingling and numbness Muscle weakness Muscle paralysis Temporary external pacing wires for cardiac procedures Guidewires for catheter placement Cardiac pacemaker Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Spinal cord stimulator"
What do EMG and nerve conduction studies diagnose?,"'EMG and nerve conduction studies are useful in diagnosing neuromuscular diseases such as:' Muscular dystrophy: progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass Radiculopathy: pain and weakness caused by pinched nerves from herniated discs or degenerative disc disease Peripheral neuropathy: nerve pain from damage to peripheral nerves Myasthenia gravis: muscle weakness due to problems in the nerve and muscle junction Carpal tunnel syndrome: pain, numbness and tingling in the arm due to compressed nerve Guillain-Barre syndrome: a condition where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves in the arms and legs Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: an inherited condition which affects the nerves and causes weakness of foot and lower leg muscles"
How are EMG and nerve conduction studies performed?,"'EMG and nerve conduction studies are usually performed by a neurophysiologist, as an outpatient procedure. A technician operates the device while the neurophysiologist studies and interprets the results for a diagnosis. The tests may take one or two hours depending on how many muscles and nerves are tested.''The patient may be required to''The technician' Shower but must not use any lotions or oils on the skin Avoid caffeine and sugary beverages for two to three hours prior Avoid smoking Inform the doctor of any recent infections Inform the physician if they have any implanted electrical devices  The neurologist inserts a thin needle electrode into the muscle that is to be tested. The muscle’s electrical activity is transmitted to the EMG machine. The neurologist will instruct the patient to flex or relax the muscle. The corresponding nerve may also be stimulated to record the muscle’s response. Applies a gel over the skin and places electrodes at different locations along the specific nerves. Delivers a small impulse of electric current through the stimulating electrode. The other electrodes record the nerve’s response and the time for conduction of the signal. The nerve response is recorded in the device and appears on a monitor."
How painful are EMG and nerve conduction studies?,'The nerve conduction study may cause a certain amount of discomfort when the mild ''shock'' is delivered to the nerve. There usually is no pain after the procedure. The insertion of EMG needle can cause a pain like a muscle injection. The muscle may feel sore for a few days after the test.' 
What are the risks of EMG and nerve conduction studies?,'EMG and nerve conduction studies are low-risk procedures. A very mild electrical impulse is used in the nerve conduction study that is unlikely to cause any harm. With the needle insertion during EMG procedure there may be a small risk of:' Infection Bleeding Nerve injury
What is a nerve conduction velocity test (NCV)?,"'A nerve conduction velocity test (NCV) is an electrical test that is used to determine the adequacy of the conduction of the nerve impulse as it courses down a nerve. This test is used to detect signs of nerve injury. '""In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated, and the electrical impulse 'down stream' from the stimulus is measured. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease or abnormal pressure on the nerve. A nerve conduction velocity test is often done at the same time as an ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''). An EMG is carried out in order to exclude or detect muscle conditions which may be present due to muscular or neurologic disease. '  "
Why the nerve conduction velocity test is performed,"'Symptoms that might prompt a health care professional to order a nerve conduction velocity test test include numbness, tingling, and/or burning sensations. The nerve conduction velocity test test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as ''peripheral neuropathy'' and mononeuritis multiplex) or conditions whereby nerves are affected by mechanical compression injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome'' and other compression neuropathies). A normal body temperature must be maintained for the nerve conduction velocity test, because low body temperatures slow the speed of nerve conduction.' "
What bladder control problems does nerve damage cause?,"'Nerves that work poorly can lead to three different kinds of bladder control problems. ''Overactive bladder''. Damaged nerves may send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without warning. The ''symptoms of overactive bladder'' include ''Poor control of sphincter muscles''. Sphincter muscles surround the urethra and keep it closed to hold urine in the bladder. If the nerves to the sphincter muscles are damaged, the muscles may become loose and allow leakage or stay tight when you are trying to release urine. ''Urine retention''. For some people, nerve damage means their bladder muscles do not get the message that it is time to release urine or are too weak to completely empty the bladder. If the bladder becomes too full, urine may back up and the increasing pressure may damage the kidneys. Or urine that stays too long may lead to an infection in the kidneys or bladder. Urine retention may also lead to overflow ''incontinence''. '   urinary frequency -- defined as urination eight or more times a day or two or more times at night urinary urgency -- the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately urge incontinence -- leakage of urine that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate"
What causes nerve damage?,"'Many events or conditions can damage nerves and nerve pathways. Some of the most common causes are ''In addition, some children are born with nerve problems that can keep the bladder from releasing urine, leading to urinary infections or kidney damage. ' vaginal childbirth infections of the brain or spinal cord diabetes stroke accidents that injure the brain or spinal cord multiple sclerosis heavy metal poisoning"
How will the doctor test for nerve damage and bladder control problems?,"'Any evaluation for a health problem begins with a medical history and a general physical examination. Your doctor can use this information to narrow down the possible causes for your bladder problem. ''If nerve damage is suspected, the doctor may need to test both the bladder itself and the nervous system, including the brain. Three different kinds of tests might be used: ''Urodynamics''. These tests involve measuring pressure in the bladder while it is being filled to see how much it can hold and then checking to see whether the bladder empties completely and efficiently. ''Imaging''. The doctor may use different types of equipment - ''ultrasound'', X-rays, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scans -- to take pictures of the urinary tract and nervous system, including the brain. ''EEG and EMG''. An electroencephalograph (''EEG'') is a test in which wires with pads are placed on the forehead to sense any dysfunction in the brain. The doctor may also use an electromyograph (''EMG''), which uses wires with pads placed on the lower abdomen to test the nerves and muscles of the bladder. '  "
What are the treatments for overactive bladder?,"'The treatment for a bladder control problem depends on the cause of the nerve damage and the type of voiding dysfunction that results. ''In the case of ''overactive bladder'', your doctor may suggest a number of strategies, including bladder training, electrical stimulation, drug therapy, and, in severe cases where all other treatments have failed, surgery. ''Bladder training''. Your doctor may ask you to keep a bladder diary -- a record of your fluid intake, trips to the bathroom, and episodes of urine leakage. This record may indicate a pattern and suggest ways to avoid accidents by making a point of using the bathroom at certain times of the day -- a practice called timed voiding. As you gain control, you can extend the time between trips to the bathroom. Bladder training also includes Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles that hold in urine. ''Electrical stimulation''. Mild electrical pulses can be used to stimulate the nerves that control the bladder and sphincter muscles. There are two approaches to bladder nerve stimulation; peripheral and central. Peripheral stimulation is called percuntaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and involves weekly treatments during which a physician plaes a small needle near the ankle and sends a small electrical current through the tibial nerve. Central stimulation is called InterStim and involves a minor surgical procedure to place the electric wire near the tailbone. This procedure involves two steps. First, the wire is placed under the skin and connected to a temporary stimulator, which you carry with you for several days. If your condition improves during this trial period, then the wire is placed next to the tailbone and attached to a permanent stimulator under your skin. The InterStim system is used to treat urge incontinence, urgency-frequency syndrome, and ''urinary retention'' in patients for whom other treatments have not worked. ''Drug therapy''. Different ''drugs'' can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways. ''Surgery'"". In extreme cases, when incontinence is severe and other treatments have failed, surgery may be considered. The bladder may be made larger through an operation known as augmentation cystoplasty, in which a part of the diseased bladder is replaced with a section taken from the patient's bowel. This operation may improve the ability to store urine but may make the bladder more difficult to empty, making regular catheterization necessary. Additional risks of surgery include the bladder breaking open and leaking urine into the body, bladder stones, mucus in the bladder, and infection. ""   Drugs that relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms include oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), 
solifenacin (Vesicare), darifenacin (Enablex), trospium chloride (Sanctura), 
festerodine (Toviaz), hyoscyamine (Levsin), and propantheline bromide (Pro-Banthine), which belong to the class of drugs called anticholinergics. Their most common side effect is dry mouth, although large doses may cause blurred vision, constipation, a faster heartbeat, and flushing. A new patch delivery system for oxybutynin (Oxytrol) may decrease side effects 
and is now available without a prescription. Newly approved medications for 
overactive bladder include Botox and mirabegron (Myrbetriq). Mirabegron belongs 
to a unique class of drugs called beta-3 adrenergic agonists and may be 
effective or better tolerated in cases where anticholinergics have not been 
successful. Botox can be injected into the bladder muscle using a cystoscope for 
patients who have failed other treatments. Drugs for depression that also relax bladder muscles include imipramine hydrochloride (Tofranil), a tricyclic antidepressant. Side effects may include fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and insomnia. "
How do you do Kegel exercises?,"'Kegel exercises strengthen the muscles that hold up the bladder and keep it closed. ''The first step in doing Kegel exercises is to find the right muscles. Imagine you are trying to stop yourself from passing ''gas''. Squeeze the muscles you would use. If you sense a ""pulling"" feeling, those are the right muscles for pelvic exercises. '""Try not to squeeze other muscles at the same time. Be careful not to tighten your stomach, legs, or buttocks. Squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles. Just squeeze the pelvic muscles. Don't hold your breath. """"At first, find a quiet spot to practice - your bathroom or bedroom - so you can concentrate. Pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of 3. Then relax for a count of 3. Repeat, but don't overdo it. Work up to 3 sets of 10 repeats. Start doing your pelvic muscle exercises lying down. This position is the easiest because the muscles do not need to work against gravity. When your muscles get stronger, do your exercises sitting or standing. Working against gravity is like adding more weight. """"Be patient. Don't give up. It takes just 5 minutes a day. You may not feel your bladder control improve for 3 to 6 weeks. Still, most people do notice an improvement after a few weeks. ""'Some people with nerve damage cannot tell whether they are doing Kegel exercises correctly. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or nurse to examine you while you try to do them. If you are not squeezing the right muscles, you can still learn proper Kegel exercises by doing special training with biofeedback, electrical stimulation, or both. ' "
What are the treatments for lack of coordination between the bladder and urethra?,"'The job of the sphincter muscles is to hold urine in the bladder by squeezing the urethra shut. If the urethral sphincter fails to stay closed, urine may leak out of the bladder. When nerve signals are coordinated properly, the sphincter muscles relax to allow urine to pass through the urethra as the bladder contracts to push out urine. If the signals are not coordinated, the bladder and the sphincter may contract at the same time, so urine cannot pass easily. ''Drug therapy for an uncoordinated bladder and urethra''. Scientists have not yet found a drug that works selectively on the urethral sphincter muscles, but drugs used to reduce ''muscle spasms'' or ''tremors'' are sometimes used to help the sphincter relax. ''Baclofen'' (''Lioresal'') is prescribed for muscle spasms or cramping in patients with ''multiple sclerosis'' and spinal injuries. ''Diazepam'' (''Valium'') can be taken as a muscle relaxant or to reduce ''anxiety''. Drugs called alpha-adrenergic blockers can also be used to relax the sphincter. Examples of these drugs are ''alfuzosin'' (''UroXatral''), ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax''), ''terazosin'' (''Hytrin''), silodosin (Rapaflo), and doxazosin (''Cardura''). The main side effects are ''low blood pressure'', ''dizziness'', ''fainting'', and ''nasal congestion''. All of these drugs have been used to relax the urethral sphincter in people whose sphincter does not relax well on its own.\xa0 ' "
What are the treatments for urine retention?,"'Urine retention may occur either because the bladder wall muscles cannot contract or because the sphincter muscles cannot relax. ''Catheter''. A catheter is a thin tube that can be inserted through the urethra into the bladder to allow urine to flow into a collection bag. If you are able to place the catheter yourself, you can learn to carry out the procedure at regular intervals, a practice called clean intermittent catheterization. Some patients cannot place their own catheters because nerve damage affects their hand coordination as well as their voiding function. These patients need to have a ''caregiver'' place the catheter for them at regular intervals. If regular catheter placement is not feasible, the patients may need to have an indwelling catheter that can be changed less often. Indwelling catheters have several risks, including infection, bladder stones, and bladder tumors. However, if the bladder cannot be emptied any other way, then the catheter is the only way to stop the buildup of urine in the bladder that can damage the kidneys. ''Urethral stent''. ''Stents'' are small tube-like devices inserted into the urethra and allowed to expand, like a spring, widening the opening for urine to flow out. Stents can help prevent urine backup when the bladder wall and sphincter contract at the same time because of improper nerve signals. However, stents can cause problems if they move or lead to infection. ''Surgery''. Men may consider a surgery that removes the external sphincter - a sphincterotomy - or a piece of it - a sphincter resection - to prevent ''urinary retention''. The surgeon will pass a thin instrument through the urethra to deliver electrical or laser energy that ''burns'' away sphincter tissue. Possible complications include bleeding that requires a transfusion and, rarely, problems with erections. This procedure causes loss of urine control and requires the patient to collect urine by wearing an external catheter that fits over the penis like a ''condom''. No external collection device is available for women. ''Urinary diversion''. If other treatments fail and urine regularly backs up and damages the kidneys, the doctor may recommend a urinary diversion, a procedure that may require an outside collection bag attached to a stoma, a surgically created opening where urine passes out of the body. Another form of urinary diversion replaces the bladder with a continent urinary reservoir, an internal pouch made from sections of the bowel or other tissue. This method allows the person to store urine inside the body until a catheter is used to empty it through a stoma. ' "
Hope through research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has many research programs aimed at finding treatments for urinary disorders, including bladder control problems caused by nerve damage. NIDDK-supported researchers have narrowed the search for a gene that causes neurological problems in bladder, bowel, and facial muscles. Finding the gene may lead to greater understanding of how nerves and muscles work together and how nerve damage can cause urination problems. ''The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development is supporting Collaborative Urological Research in ''Spinal Cord Injury'', a program devoted to finding novel strategies to treat bladder control problems in people with spinal cord injury.

What is cryotherapy and how does it work?,"'Cryotherapy is a ''pain'' treatment that uses a method of localized freezing temperatures to deaden an irritated nerve. Cryotherapy is also used as a method of treating localized areas of some ''cancers'' (called cryosurgery), such as ''prostate cancer'' and to treat abnormal skin cells by dermatologists. In this article we only discuss its use in nerve conditions.''In cryotherapy, a probe is inserted into the tissue next to the affected nerve. The temperature of the probe drops to then effectively freeze the nerve. The freezing inactivates the nerve and, as a result, painful nerve irritation is relieved. Cryotherapy is a relatively safe and effective means of treating localized nerve irritation. '  "
What conditions can be treated with cryotherapy?,"'Cryotherapy can be used to treat conditions that involve irritation of an isolated nerve. In general, such conditions include benign nerve growths (''neuromas'') and pinched nerves (nerve entrapments). Specific examples include nerve irritation between the ribs (intercostal neuralgia), cluneal ''nerve entrapment'', ilioinguinal neuroma, hypogastric neuromas, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment, and interdigital neuromas. Many forms of nerve entrapment can often be treated with cryotherapy.'  "
What are the side effects of cryotherapy?,"'While cryotherapy can reduce unwanted nerve irritation, it sometimes can leave the tissue affected with unusual sensations, such as numbness or tingling, or with redness and irritation of the skin. These effects are generally temporary.'  "
Where is cryotherapy performed?,"""Cryotherapy procedures are usually performed in the doctor's office."" "
What is a pinched nerve?,"'A ""pinched nerve"" is the name given to the uncomfortable sensation, ''pain'', or numbness caused when increased pressure leads to irritation or damage to a peripheral nerve. (A peripheral nerve is one that is outside the brain and spinal cord.) Although this condition is often associated with ''back pain'' or a ''neck injury'', almost any nerve is susceptible.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a pinched nerve?,"'The most common pinched nerve symptom is a tingling sensation, which can be accompanied by some numbness. This may initially come and go, but over time becomes persistent. ''Pain'' may accompany the tingling sensation and is often described as being ""sharp"" or ""electrical."" Some patients experience a burning sensation in the affected area.''In severe cases, muscle ''weakness'' may occur because the nerve that controls the muscle has been irritated. If present and not identified and corrected, those muscles may decrease in size and function.''Common areas where nerves are pinched include the following:''Of note, although ''tennis elbow'' is a painful condition often associated with repetitive activities, the pain is caused by inflammation of the tendons of the elbow, not a pinched nerve.'   carpal tunnel (where the median nerve at the wrist is injured) ulnar nerve at the elbow (frequently caused by leaning on elbows while sitting or driving) lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (This is also known as meralgia paresthetica, caused by compression of the sensory nerve leading to the upper thigh. This may also be seen in pregnancy, when the enlarging uterus can also cause nerve compression.) common peroneal nerve injury (associated with crossing the legs at the knee) sciatic nerve problems or sciatica, pain which travels from the low back into the leg (This is frequently used to label the symptoms associated with a pinched nerve in the low back or lumbar spine. Patients with this condition describe pain which travels from the back into a leg or hip.) cervical spine (A pinched nerve in the neck can cause pain or tingling in the spine to travel into the arm or shoulder blade region.)"
What causes a pinched nerve?,"'Pressure on a peripheral nerve can irritate the nerve itself, its protective covering (myelin sheath), or both. When this occurs, the nerve is unable to conduct sensory impulses to the brain appropriately, leading to a sense of numbness. This inflammation associated with the damage or injury can also cause pain or paresthesia (a tingling or prickling sensation) signals to be sent to the brain. In its early stages, many people may describe this sensation as a body part that has ""fallen asleep."" However, if nerve inflammation persists, this sensation persists rather than resolving after a few minutes.''If the nerve is compressed for a short amount of time, it is often able to repair itself but it may take several weeks or months for the symptoms to fully resolve. However, if the compression remains present for a long time, permanent nerve injury may occur.'  "
What are the risk factors for a pinched nerve?,"'Anything which increases pressure around a nerve can cause a pinched nerve. Common causes include body position such as leaning on elbows, habitually crossing legs, or poor posture. Over time this may lead to pressure injury to nerves in these regions.' Disc herniation or bulging discs and arthritis in the spine can cause pressure on nerve roots which leads to the nerve pain or discomfort associated with a pinched nerve. Weight gain or water retention can predispose people to developing pinched nerves; thyroid disease (especially hypothyroidism, or low thyroid hormone levels) can contribute to both water retention and weight gain and can increase the risk of certain types of pinched nerves. Pregnancy, which is associated with increased weight and occasionally associated with water retention, is also a common risk factor for developing certain types of pinched nerves. Repetitive activities (typing and using certain tools) can also increase swelling around specific nerves and lead to symptoms of a pinched nerve."
What tests diagnose a pinched nerve?,"'The health care professional often makes the diagnosis of pinched nerve by taking a history of symptoms and performing a careful physical examination. Depending on the findings, the diagnosis may be made clinically or further testing may be required.''Electromyography (''EMG'') is a nerve conduction study to help confirm the diagnosis of a pinched nerve and to determine the extent of nerve damage.''If the pinched nerve is in the neck (cervical spine) or back (lumbar spine), an ''MRI'' or ''CT scan'' may be considered to make the diagnosis and look for the cause (''herniated disc'', arthritis, or ''fracture'').'  "
What are pinched nerve treatment options and home remedies?,"'The treatment of a pinched nerve depends upon the location and the cause. Resting the affected area is often very effective, especially in cases of injury caused by repetitive activities. Physical therapy is frequently beneficial when a pinched ''spinal nerve'' is caused by problems in the neck or low back. Exercises may strengthen the back or core muscles and decrease or eliminate pressure on a nerve root. ''Over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like ''ibuprofen'' and ''naproxen'' may be helpful. Injections of ''corticosteroids'' (an anti-inflammatory medication) may also be beneficial for many types of pinched nerves.''For cases of ''carpal tunnel syndrome'', splinting or bracing the wrist is often used. In cases of ulnar neuropathy or common peroneal neuropathy, learning to change body positions may be required to achieve the best outcome.''Weight loss'' can be of benefit for many types of pinched nerves.''Surgery may be required to release pressure on the nerve if it fails to respond to medication, splinting, physical therapy, or injections. The specific type of surgery depends upon the nerve involved. However, the goal of the surgery is the same, to eliminate or relieve the pressure on the affected nerve.'  "
Can a pinched nerve go away without treatment? Can nerve damage be permanent?,"""In many cases, once a pinched nerve has been identified, the symptoms can be resolved when treatment allows the nerve to recover. There are instances where the nerve damage is permanent, and a patient may be left with permanent numbness or pain in the affected area. Many patients fall in between. Because nerves can regenerate (regrow) very slowly over time, it's important to seek evaluation for symptoms which persist or recur over a number of days or weeks."" "
Can you prevent a pinched nerve?,"'Paying attention to body positions (maintaining good posture, not leaning on elbows, reducing the frequency of leg crossing) and decreasing repetitive activities can help prevent a pinched nerve. Using ergonomic principles at work and at home can decrease the risk of nerve injuries. If repetitive activities are necessary to perform a task, incorporating frequent breaks or rest periods can reduce or eliminate the risk of nerve injury.' "
What is neuroblastoma?,"'Neuroblastoma is a disease in which ''malignant'' (cancer) cells form in nerve tissue of the adrenal gland, neck, chest, or spinal cord.''Neuroblastoma often begins in the nerve tissue of the adrenal glands. There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney in the back of the upper abdomen. The adrenal glands produce important hormones that help control ''heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', blood ''sugar'', and the way the body reacts to ''stress''. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the chest, in nerve tissue near the spine in the neck, or in the spinal cord.''Neuroblastoma most often begins during early childhood, usually in children younger than 5 years. It sometimes forms before birth but is usually found later, when the tumor begins to grow and cause symptoms. In rare cases, neuroblastoma may be found before birth by fetal ultrasound.''By the time neuroblastoma is diagnosed, the cancer has usually metastasized (spread), most often to the lymph nodes, bones, bone marrow, ''liver'', and skin.' "
"Possible signs of neuroblastoma include bone pain and a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest.","'The most common symptoms of neuroblastoma are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone. These and other symptoms may be caused by neuroblastoma. Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur:''Less common signs of neuroblastoma include the following:'   Lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest. Bulging eyes. Dark circles around the eyes (""black eyes""). Pains in the bones. Swollen stomach and trouble breathing in infants. Painless, bluish lumps under the skin in infants. Weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part). Fever. Shortness of breath. Feeling tired. Easy bruising or bleeding. Petechiae (flat, pinpoint, dark spots under the skin caused by bleeding). High blood pressure. Severe watery diarrhea. Jerky muscle movements. Uncontrolled eye movement. Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, or scrotum."
Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to detect (find) and diagnose neuroblastoma.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:'  Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Twenty-four-hour urine test: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. A higher than normal amount of the substances homovanillic acid (HMA) and vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) may be a sign of neuroblastoma. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. A higher than normal amount of the hormones dopamine and norepinephrine may be a sign of neuroblastoma. Cytogenetic analysis: A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of a small piece of bone, bone marrow, and blood by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views both the bone and the bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. X-ray: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Neurological exam: A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Immunohistochemistry study: A procedure in which dyes or enzymes are added to a blood or bone marrow sample to test for certain antigens (proteins that stimulate the body's immune response)."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''Age of the child when diagnosed. Stage of the cancer. Where the tumor is in the body. Tumor histology (the shape, function, and structure of the tumor cells). Prognosis and treatment decisions for neuroblastoma are also affected by tumor biology, which includes:''The patterns of the tumor cells. How different the tumor cells are from normal cells. How fast the tumor cells are growing. The number of chromosomes in the tumor cells. How many copies of the N-myc gene there are. The tumor biology is said to be favorable or unfavorable, depending on these factors. A favorable tumor biology means there is a better chance of recovery.' "
Stages of neuroblastoma,"'After neuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer has spread from where it started to other parts of the body.''The process used to find out the extent or spread of cancer is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process helps determine the stage of the disease. For neuroblastoma, stage is one of the factors used to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used to determine the stage:''In stage 1, the tumor is in only one area and all of the tumor that can be seen is completely removed during surgery.''Stage 2 is divided into stage 2A and 2B.''In stage 3, one of the following is true:''Stage 4 is divided into stage 4 and stage 4S.' Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: The removal of a small piece of bone, bone marrow, and blood by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views both the bone and bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Lymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following types of biopsies may be done: Excisional biopsy: The removal of an entire lymph node. Incisional biopsy or core biopsy: The removal of part of a lymph node using a wide needle. Needle biopsy or fine-needle aspiration: The removal of a sample of tissue or fluid from a lymph node using a thin needle. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). X-rays of the chest, bones, and abdomen: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Radionuclide scan: A procedure to find areas in the body where cells, such as cancer cells, are dividing rapidly. A very small amount of radioactive material is swallowed or injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones or other tissues and is detected by a radiation-measuring device. These tests include bone scans, PET and MIBG scans. Stage 2A: The tumor is in only one area and all of the tumor that can be seen cannot be completely removed during surgery. Stage 2B: The tumor is in only one area and all of the tumor that can be seen may be completely removed during surgery. Cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes near the tumor. the tumor cannot be completely removed during surgery and has spread from one side of the body to the other side and may also have spread to nearby lymph nodes; or the tumor is in only one area, on one side of the body, but has spread to lymph nodes on the other side of the body; or the tumor is in the middle of the body and has spread to tissues or lymph nodes on both sides of the body, and the tumor cannot be removed by surgery. In stage 4, the tumor has spread to distant lymph nodes, the skin, or other parts of the body. In stage 4S, the following are true: the child is younger than 1 year; and the cancer has spread to the skin, liver, and/or bone marrow, but not into the bone itself; and the primary tumor is in only one area and all of the tumor in that location that can be seen may be completely removed during surgery; and/or cancer cells may be found in the lymph nodes near the primary tumor."
Treatment of neuroblastoma is based on risk groups.,"'For many types of cancer, stages are used to plan treatment. For neuroblastoma, treatment depends on risk groups. The stage of neuroblastoma is one factor used to determine risk group. Other factors are the age of the child, tumor histology, and tumor biology.''There are 3 risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk.''Progressive neuroblastoma is cancer that has progressed (continued to grow) during treatment. Recurrent neuroblastoma is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body.''There are different types of treatment for patients with neuroblastoma.''Different types of treatment are available for patients with neuroblastoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.''Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site 2. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.''Children with neuroblastoma should always have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating childhood cancer''.'""Your child's treatment will be managed by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist may refer you to other pediatric doctors who have experience and expertise in treating children with neuroblastoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:""'Children who are treated for neuroblastoma may be at higher risk for second ''cancers''.''Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear years after cancer treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment include physical problems; changes in mood, feelings, actions, thinking, learning, or memory; and second cancers.''Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important that parents of children who are treated for neuroblastoma talk with their doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.''Four types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is usually used to treat neuroblastoma. Depending on where the tumor is and whether it has spread, as much of the tumor as possible will be removed. If the tumor cannot be removed, a biopsy may be done instead.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the spinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''The use of two or more anticancer drugs is called combination chemotherapy.'""Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until symptoms appear or change.""'New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. These include the following:''Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to deliver drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.''High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. ''Stem cells'' (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy and radiation therapy are completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion, just like a ''blood transfusion'"". These reinfused stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and grow into (and restore) the body's bone marrow so it can again make blood cells.""""13-cis retinoic acid is a vitamin -like drug that slows the cancer's ability to make more cancer cells and changes how these cells look and act.""'This summary section refers to specific treatments under study in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied.

What is urinary incontinence?,"'Loss of bladder control is ''urinary incontinence''. Severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine while straining, ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' to having a frequent sudden urge to urinate. Urinary ''incontinence'' can affect daily activities and quality of life. Therefore, it requires appropriate treatment. Neurological disorders that cause loss of bladder control cause a condition called neurogenic bladder. The cause may be in the brain, spinal cord or nerves supplying the bladder. Treatment involves medical management and lifestyle changes.' "

What are the symptoms of neurological damage to the bladder?,'People with this condition may have the following symptoms' Frequent urination although the quantity is less Problems with starting to urinate or emptying the bladder Loss of bladder control Problems knowing if the bladder is full Repeated urinary tract infections
How is urinary incontinence treated?,"'Treatment options for urinary incontinence depend on the type of incontinence, severity and underlying cause. A combination of medical treatments, exercises and lifestyle modifications may be needed to manage urinary continence associated with neurogenic bladder.''Treatment options include' Behavioral techniquesFluid and diet management: This means reducing or avoiding alcohol, caffeine or acidic foods and decreasing fluid consumption.Bladder training: This means training the bladder to delay urination after having the urge to urinate. Patients could start by trying to hold off going to the bathroom for 10 minutes every time there’s an urge to urinate and gradually lengthening the time between going to the bathroom.Double voiding: This means urinating and then waiting to urinate again after a few minutes.Bladder diary: Keeping a bladder diary may help you to record some things that make your symptoms worse.

Pelvic floor muscle exercises: The pelvic floor muscles support the bladder. Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles by doing exercises recommended by the doctor can help manage urinary incontinence. These are also called Kegel exercises. The first step is to imagine that you're trying to stop urinary flow and then contract or tighten the muscles you would use to do that.  Hold the position for two to 10 seconds and then relax for two to 10 seconds. This should be performed at least three times a day for a few minutes each time. Electrical stimulation: Electrodes (rods that can conduct small shocks) can be temporarily inserted into the rectum or vagina to stimulate and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. MedicationsAlpha blockers: They help treat overflow and urge incontinence. They relax the bladder muscles, making it easier to empty the bladder. Examples include Flomax (tamsulosin) and Cardura (doxazosin).Anticholinergics: These help to control an overactive bladder and help in treating urge incontinence. Examples include Ditropan XL (oxybutynin) and Sanctura (trospium).Mirabegron: This is used to relax the bladder muscles, hence increasing bladder capacity.Botulinum toxin (Botox®) injections: These may be used to help patients who have an overactive bladder due to a brain or spinal cord disease or injury. These may need to be repeated every three months.Sacral neuromodulation: This technique is used for patients with an overactive bladder when drugs or lifestyle changes do not work. The sacral nerves carry signals between your spine and bladder. Manipulation of these signals can improve overactive bladder symptoms. The surgeon places a thin wire close to the sacral nerves. Then, the wire is connected to a small, battery-operated device placed under your skin. It delivers electrical impulses of harmless intensity to the bladder to stop the “bad” signals that can cause an overactive bladder.Catheterization of the bladder: If nothing else works, the bladder may be catheterized for a short or long period of time. A tube is inserted inside the bladder through the urinary opening. This helps drain the bladder. The urine is collected in a bag that is attached to the tube.

Introduction,"'Neuropathic pain'' is a complex, ''chronic pain'' state that usually is accompanied by tissue injury. With neuropathic ''pain'', the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other ''pain'' centers. The impact of nerve ''fiber'' injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.''One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain.' "
What causes neuropathic pain?,"'Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause; but, some common causes of neuropathic pain include:' Alcoholism Amputation Back, leg, and hip problems Chemotherapy Diabetes Facial nerve problems HIV infection or AIDS Multiple sclerosis Shingles Spine surgery"
What are the symptoms of neuropathic pain?,'Symptoms may include:' Shooting and burning pain Tingling and numbness
How is neuropathic pain diagnosed?,"'A doctor will conduct an interview and physical exam. He or she may ask questions about how you would describe your pain, when the pain occurs, or whether anything specific triggers the pain.' "
How is neuropathic pain treated?,"'Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', such as ''Aleve'' or ''Motrin'', may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller, such as those containing morphine. Anticonvulsant and ''antidepressant'' drugs seem to work in some cases.''If another condition, such as ''diabetes'', is involved, better management of that disorder may alleviate the pain.''In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use invasive or implantable device therapies to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in neuropathic pain generation may significantly control the pain symptoms.''Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious disability.' "
What is neuropathic pain?,"'When the sensory system is impacted by injury or disease, the nerves within that system cannot work to transmit sensation to the brain. This often leads to a sense of numbness, or lack of sensation. However, in some cases when this system is injured, individuals experience ''pain'' in the affected region. Neuropathic ''pain'' does not start abruptly or resolve quickly; it is a chronic condition which leads to persistent pain symptoms. For many patients, the intensity of their symptoms can wax and wane throughout the day. Although neuropathic pain is thought to be associated with peripheral nerve problems, such as neuropathy caused by ''diabetes'' or spinal stenosis, injuries to the brain or spinal cord can also lead to chronic neuropathic pain.''Neuropathic pain can be contrasted to nociceptive pain, which is the type of pain which occurs when someone experiences an acute injury, such as smashing a finger with a hammer or stubbing a toe when ''walking'' barefoot. This type of pain is typically short-lived and usually quite responsive to common pain medications in contrast to neuropathic pain.' "
What are the risk factors for neuropathic pain?,"'Anything that leads to loss of function within the sensory nervous system can cause neuropathic pain. As such, nerve problems from ''carpal tunnel syndrome'' or similar conditions can trigger neuropathic pain. ''Trauma'', causing nerve injury, can lead to neuropathic pain. Other conditions which can predispose patients to developing neuropathic pain include ''diabetes'', vitamin deficiencies, ''cancer'', ''HIV'', ''stroke'', ''multiple sclerosis'', ''shingles'', and ''cancer'' treatments.' "
What causes neuropathic pain?,"'There are many reasons that patients may develop neuropathic pain. However, on a cellular level, one explanation is that an increased release of certain neurotransmitters which signal pain, combined with an impaired ability of the nerves to regulate these signals leads to the sensation of pain originating from the affected region. Additionally, in the spinal cord, the area which interprets painful signals is rearranged, with corresponding changes in neurotransmitters and loss of normally-functioning cell bodies; these alterations result in the perception of pain even in the absence of external stimulation. In the brain, the ability to block pain can be lost following an injury such as ''stroke'' or trauma. Over time, further cellular damage occurs and the sense of pain persists.''Neuropathic pain is associated with ''diabetes'', chronic ''alcohol'' intake, certain ''cancers'', vitamin B deficiency, infections, other nerve-related diseases, toxins, and certain ''drugs''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of neuropathic pain?,"'Unlike other neurological conditions, identification of neuropathic pain is hard. Few, if any, objective signs are present. Examiners have to decipher and interpret a collection of words that patients use to describe their pain. Patients may describe their symptoms as sharp, dull, hot, ''cold'', sensitive, ''itchy'', deep, stinging, burning, or some other descriptor. Additionally, some patients may feel pain with a light touch or pressure.''In an effort to help identify how much pain patients may be experiencing, different scales are often used. Patients are asked to rate their pain based on a visual scale or numeric graph. Many examples of pain scales exist. Often, pictures of faces depicting various degrees of pain can be helpful when patients have a difficult time describing the amount of pain they are experiencing.'  "
How is neuropathic pain diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of pain is based upon further assessment of a patient's history. If underlying nerve damage is suspected, then evaluation of the nerves with testing may be warranted. The most common way to evaluate whether a nerve is injured is with electrodiagnostic medicine. This medical subspecialty uses techniques of a nerve conduction studies with electromyelography (NCS/""'EMG''). Clinical evaluation may reveal some evidence of loss of function, and can include assessment of light touch, the ability to distinguish sharp from dull, the ability to discern temperature, and assessment of vibration. Once a thorough clinical examination is performed, the electrodiagnostic study can be planned. These studies are performed by specially trained ''neurologist'' and physiatrists.''If neuropathy is suspected, a search for reversible causes should be done. This can include blood work for vitamin deficiencies or thyroid abnormalities, and imaging studies to exclude a structural lesion impacting the spinal cord. Depending on the results of this testing, there may be a way to decrease the severity of the neuropathy and potentially decrease the pain that a patient is experiencing. Unfortunately, in many conditions, even good control of the underlying cause of the neuropathy cannot reverse the neuropathy. This is commonly seen in patients with ''diabetic neuropathy''.''In rare instances, there may be evidence of changes in the skin and hair growth pattern in an affected area. These alterations may be associated with changes in ''sweating'' or ''perspiration'' as well. When present, these changes can help identify the probable presence of neuropathic pain associated with a condition called ''complex regional pain syndrome''.' "
What is the treatment for neuropathic pain?,"'Various medications have been used in an attempt to treat neuropathic pain. The majority of these medications are used off-label, meaning that the medication was approved by the FDA to treat other conditions and was then identified as being beneficial to treat neuropathic pain. ''Tricyclic antidepressants'' (''amitriptyline'', ''nortriptyline'', ''desipramine'') have been prescribed for control of neuropathic pain for many years. Some patients find that these can be quite effective in giving them relief. Other types of ''antidepressants'' have also been shown to provide some relief. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs like ''paroxetine'' and ''citalopram'') and other antidepressants (''venlafaxine'', ''bupropion'') have been used in some patients.''Another common treatment of neuropathic pain includes antiseizure medications (''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'', ''gabapentin'', ''lamotrigine'"", and others). In severe cases of painful neuropathy which don't respond to first-line agents, medications typically used to treat ""'heart'' arrhythmias may be of some benefit; however, these can lead to significant side effects and must be monitored closely. Medications applied directly to the skin can provide modest to pronounced benefit for some patients. The forms commonly used include ''lidocaine'' (in patch or gel form) or capsaicin. Multiple arguments have been made both promoting and vilifying the use of narcotic agents to treat chronic neuropathic pain. No specific recommendations regarding the use of narcotics will be made at this time.''Curing neuropathic pain is dependent on the underlying cause. If the cause is reversible, then the peripheral nerves may regenerate and the pain will abate; however, this reduction in pain may take many months to years.'  "
What is the prognosis for neuropathic pain?,"'Many patients with neuropathic pain are able to find some measure of relief, even if their pain persists. Although neuropathic pain is not dangerous to a patient, the presence of ''chronic pain'' can negatively impact quality of life. Patients with chronic ''nerve pain'' may suffer from ''sleep'' deprivation or mood disorders, including ''depression'' and ''anxiety''. Because of the underlying neuropathy and lack of sensory feedback, patients are at risk of developing injury or infection or unknowingly causing an escalation of an existing injury.' "
Can neuropathic pain be prevented?,"'The best way to prevent neuropathic pain is to avoid development of neuropathy. Monitoring and modifying lifestyle choices, including limiting the use of tobacco and alcohol; maintaining a healthy weight to decrease the risk of diabetes, ''degenerative joint disease'', or ''stroke''; and using good ergonomic form at work or when practicing hobbies to decrease the risk of repetitive ''stress'' injury are ways to decrease the risk of developing neuropathy and possible neuropathic pain.' "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "

What is neutropenia?,"""Neutropenia is a condition in which the number of neutrophils in the bloodstream is decreased. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNs. Neutropenia reduces the body's ability to fight off ""'bacterial infections''.''White blood cells are also known as leukocytes. There are five major types of circulating white blood cells:''Some white blood cells, called granulocytes, are filled with microscopic granules that are little sacs containing enzymes (compounds that digest microorganisms). Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are all granulocytes and are part of the innate immune system with somewhat nonspecific, broad-based activity. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do the lymphocytes (B-cells and T-cells).'""Neutrophils contain enzymes that help the cell kill and digest microorganisms it has engulfed by a process known as phagocytosis. The mature neutrophil has a segmented nucleus (it is often called a 'seg' or 'poly'), while the immature neutrophil has a band-shape nucleus (it is called a band). Neutrophils are made in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream. The neutrophil has a life-span of about three days.""   basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells, monocytes, and neutrophils."
What are the signs and symptoms of neutropenia?,"'Signs and symptoms suggestive of neutropenia include:''Pneumonia'' is an infection of the ''lungs'' that can occur in people with neutropenia.' low-grade fever, skin abscesses, mouth sores, swollen gums, and symptoms suggestive of infections of the skin, perirectal area, mouth, or other areas of the body."
What causes neutropenia?,"'Neutropenia can be present (though it is relatively uncommon) in normal healthy individuals, notably in some persons of African or Arabic descent and Yemenite Jews. Neutropenia may arise as a result of decreased production of neutrophils, destruction of neutrophils after they are produced, or pooling of neutrophils (accumulation of the neutrophils out of the circulation).''Neutropenia may arise as a result of numerous medical conditions:' Infections (more commonly viral infections, but also bacterial or parasitic infections). Examples include: HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); Medications that may damage the bone marrow or neutrophils, including cancer chemotherapy; Vitamin deficiencies (megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency); Diseases of the bone marrow such as leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis; Radiation therapy; Congenital (inborn) disorders of bone marrow function or of neutrophil production, for example, Kostmann syndrome; Autoimmune destruction of neutrophils (either as a primary condition or associated with another disease such as Felty's syndrome) or from drugs stimulating the immune system to attack the cells Hypersplenism, which refers to the increased sequestration or destruction of blood cells by the spleen"
What are normal neutropenia levels and ranges?,"'The white blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range for the WBC varies slightly among laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per microliter or cubic millimeter (cmm). The WBC can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 x 10''9 ''to 10.8 x 10''9'' cells per liter. The percentage of the different types of white blood cells in the WBC is called the WBC differential.''The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is determined by the product of the white blood cell count (WBC) and the fraction of neutrophils among the white blood cells as determined by the WBC differential analysis. For example, if the WBC is 10,000 per microliter and 70% are neutrophils, the ANC would be 7,000 per microliter.''An ANC of less than 1500 per microliter (1500/microL) is the generally accepted definition of neutropenia. Neutropenia is sometimes further classified as:''Some medical terms may be used synonymously with neutropenia, even though their precise definitions are different.'   mild if the ANC ranges from 1000-1500/microL, moderate with an ANC of 500-1000/microL, and severe if the ANC is below 500/microL. Leukopenia refers to a reduced number of white blood cells in general, while granulocytopenia refers to a decreased number of all the granulocyte-type blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Since neutrophils normally far outnumber the other types of granulocytes, this term is sometimes used to refer to neutropenia. Finally, agranulocytosis literally refers to a complete absence of all granulocytes, but this term is sometimes used to refer to severe neutropenia."
Does neutropenia put a person at risk for bacterial infections?,"'Neutropenia results in an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. The degree of risk depends upon the cause and severity of the neutropenia, the underlying medical condition of the patient, and the presence or absence of bone marrow reserves for the production of neutrophils.''The most common types of infection seen in neutropenic patients (patients with low white blood cell counts) are caused by bacteria normally found on the skin (such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'') or from the gastrointestinal and urinary tract. ''Fungal infections'' are also more frequent in patients with neutropenia. The infections may be limited to certain areas of the body (commonly the oral ''cavity'', genital area, and skin) or may spread via the bloodstream to the lungs and other organs in severe, prolonged neutropenia.' "
How is neutropenia diagnosed?,"'Neutropenia is diagnosed by a blood cell count performed on a sample of blood removed from a vein. To determine the specific cause of neutropenia in a given situation, other tests may be required. Sometimes a ''bone marrow biopsy'' may be required to diagnose the specific cause of neutropenia.'  "
What is the treatment for neutropenia?,"'Treatment of neutropenia is based upon the underlying cause, severity, and the presence of associated infections or symptoms as well as the overall health status of the patient. Obviously, treatment must also be directed toward any underlying disease process. Treatments that directly address neutropenia may include (note that all of these treatments may not be appropriate in a given setting):''Preventive measures may also be implemented in neutropenic patients to limit risk of infections. These measures might include strict attention to hand washing, use of private rooms, or in some cases, use of gloves, gowns, and/or face masks by caregivers.'   antibiotic and/or antifungal medications to help fight infections; administration of white blood cells growth factors (such as recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim (Neupogen); sargramostim (Leukine); a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), a long-acting form of filgrastim) in some cases of severe neutropenia; granulocyte transfusions; and corcorticosteroid therapy or intravenous immune globulin for some cases of immune-mediated neutropenia."
What is a newborn infant hearing screening program?,"'Newborn'' infant ''hearing'' screening programs are designed to identify ''hearing loss'' in infants shortly after birth. All states have implemented these screening protocols within hospitals and birthing clinics. Most hearing screening tests are done prior to discharge from the hospital or birthing clinics.''Typically, nurses or medical assistants are trained extensively on how to operate automated equipment for testing infants. Prior to discharge, each newborn has his/her hearing tested. If, for some reason, the newborn does not pass the screen, a rescreen is usually done. If the infant does not pass the second hearing test, he/she is referred to a specialist for further testing.'""Specialists who are experts at testing hearing are called audiologists. Audiologists have had training that emphasizes diagnostic hearing testing techniques as well as hearing rehabilitation of children and adults. Their postgraduate academic training requires a minimum of a master's degree."" "
Why is it important to screen for hearing loss in all newborn infants?,"'Significant ''hearing loss'' is the most common disorder at birth.  Approximately 1%-2% of newborns are affected.''Several national committees, including the National Institutes of Health, the American Academy of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', have recommended that hearing loss in infants be identified, and when possible treated, prior to 6 months of age. This recommendation is based on studies that have shown that children identified with hearing loss prior to 6 months of age have a better chance of developing skills equivalent to their peers by the time they enter kindergarten. Children not identified until later (for example, it is very common to first identify hearing impaired children at age 2 to 3 years) may ultimately suffer from irreversible and permanent impairments in speech, language, and cognitive abilities when compared to their peers.''Prior to the implementation of hearing screen programs, it was customary to only test those newborns who had known significant risk factors for hearing loss. This group included infants whose mothers suffered from illness during ''pregnancy'', those who had a family history of hearing loss, or those who were exposed to ''drugs'' known to affect hearing. In addition, infants with the following conditions were included for hearing screening:''However, despite the testing of all infants who fell into this ""high-risk registry,"" over half of all newborns with hearing loss were missed!'""In order to identify this large group of hearing-impaired infants not identified with current testing protocols, it is now recommended that all newborns have a hearing test prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of this program is to identify all hearing-impaired infants at an early age, thereby increasing these children's chance at healthy and more productive lives.""   low birth weight and/or prematurity, or oxygen deprivation or breathing difficulties at birth; high bilirubin levels (yellow color); syndromes associated with hearing loss; abnormal head or face structures; infections such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis, herpes, or toxoplasmosis; or low Apgar scores (which assess several health factors at one and again at five minutes after birth)."
How common is hearing loss in infants?,"'Most permanent hearing loss is due to damage/malfunction of the nerve that transmits sound from the inner ear to the brain (auditory nerve).  For those infants in whom a cause is determined, approximately half have a genetic condition and the remaining half have an acquired condition to explain their hearing loss.' "
What are some of the causes of hearing loss in the newborn?,"'Hearing loss in a newborn can be caused by a number of conditions. Some of the known risk factors include high bilirubin levels (''jaundice''), drugs that are toxic to the ears (for example, medicines that are given to the newborn to battle a serious infection may damage hearing as a side effect), prolonged mechanical ventilation, low Apgar scores, meningitis, prematurity, and/or low birth weight. Malformed structures in the middle or ''outer ear'' can also lead to hearing loss. Viral illness during the pregnancy, such as ''rubella'' (''German measles'') or ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), can be passed to the newborn and result in hearing loss. Hearing loss can sometimes be ''inherited'' in abnormal genes passed from the parents to the newborn or be the result of a gene mutation that occurred during ''fetal development''. ''Genetic counseling'' is often recommended for parents to determine if heredity is the cause of the hearing loss. In approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, the cause is never determined.' "
How is hearing in infants tested?,"""Hearing in infants can be tested using two different methods: the auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluations or the otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures. Both tests are accurate, noninvasive, automated, and do not require any observable response from the infant. Which test is used depends on the screening program's choice of instrumentation and training. For a screening tool, both methods are extremely effective. There are, however, some distinct differences in how the hearing is measured using an ABR versus an OAE."" "
What is an ABR test?,"'In order to process sounds, electrical impulses are transmitted through nerves from our ears to the brainstem at the base of the brain. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a physiological measure of the brainstem\'s response to sound. It tests the integrity of the hearing system from the ear to the brainstem. The test is performed by placing four to five electrodes on the infant\'s head, after which a variety of sounds is presented to the infant through small earphones. As the hearing nerve fires, the sound stimulus travels up to the brain. This electrical activity generated by the nerve can be recorded by the electrodes and is represented as waveforms on a computer screen. The audiologist can then present different loudness levels of each sound and determine the softest levels at which the infant can hear. For infant-screening purposes, only one sound is used to test the hearing, commonly referred to as a ""click."" The click is a grouping of several sounds to test a wider area of the hearing organ at one time. The click is typically presented at a loud level and a soft one. If a healthy response is recorded, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen. Testing usually takes five to 15 minutes to complete.' "
What is an OAE evaluation?,"'An otoacoustic emission test (OAE) measures an acoustic response that is produced by the inner ear (cochlea), which in essence bounces back out of the ear in response to a sound stimulus. The test is performed by placing a small probe that contains a microphone and speaker into the infant\'s ear. As the infant rests quietly, sounds are generated in the probe. Once the cochlea processes the sound, an electrical stimulus is sent to the brainstem. In addition, there is a second and separate sound that does not travel up the nerve but comes back out into the infant\'s ear canal. This ""byproduct"" is the otoacoustic emission. The emission is then recorded with the microphone probe and represented pictorially on a computer screen. The audiologist can determine which sounds yielded a response/emission and the strength of those responses. If there is an emission present for those sounds that are critical to speech comprehension, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen.  Testing generally takes about five to eight minutes.' "
"OAEs and ABRs, is one test better than the other?","""Both tests have advantages and disadvantages when used for screening, and depending on the program and experience of the audiologist, either one can be utilized successfully. The OAE is easy and cost-effective. However, the false-positive rate (for example, an infant fails a hearing test but actually has normal hearing) may be higher for an OAE than for an ABR. The false-positive rate for ABR testing is approximately 4% when testing is done during the first three days of life.  The false positive rate for OAE testing is 5%-21% for testing done during the first three days of life.  This large variation between ABR and OAE testing is commonly felt to reflect the OAE testing device's increased sensitivity to residual ""'amniotic fluid'"" and vernix that is commonly found in the neonate's ear canal.""'The two tests, however, rely on different mechanisms of hearing for the screening. For in-depth testing and a complete hearing evaluation of infants, these tests work best together as a complement to each other.' "
What does it mean when an infant does not pass the hearing screen?,"'A newborn who fails an initial hearing screen may not necessarily have a permanent hearing loss or a hearing loss at all. There are many possible reasons why an infant may fail a hearing screening test. One common reason is that fluid from the birth may still be present in the ear canal. This fluid blocks the sound stimulus, preventing it from reaching the inner ear, and therefore causes the newborn to fail. Similarly, fluid in the middle-ear space behind the eardrum (a common site for infection in children) can also block the sound stimulus and lead to a false failed test. After these problems resolve, the infant usually passes the rescreen. Therefore, it is important to have at least one week between the initial hearing screen and the rescreen to allow the newborn a chance to ""dry out.""''Another possible reason for a false failure is excessive noise or movement from the infant during the test. The responses that are recorded with an ABR or OAE are very, very small. Any movement or crying from the infant can prevent the equipment from detecting the response. Therefore, it is important that the newborn is quiet or sleeping for the hearing screen. Feeding the infant just prior to the screening is often very helpful. Although neither test is painful, they are novel experiences for the newborn and can be momentarily upsetting.''If it becomes evident that an infant has a hearing loss, then a full diagnostic exam is necessary to determine the type and amount of hearing loss.' "
What is the difference between a hearing screen and a diagnostic hearing test?,"'The basic difference between a diagnostic test and a hearing screen is the amount of information gathered during the session. For example, if an infant fails the hearing screen, it is unknown if there truly is a hearing loss, how much hearing loss is present, or whether or not the hearing loss is permanent or correctable. A diagnostic test can usually answer these questions. The diagnostic test session is understandably longer and requires more interaction with the infant. Typically, a more extensive ABR is conducted, using a variety of test stimuli. OAEs are also performed to cross-check the results of the ABR. To complete a thorough test, the infant needs to ''sleep'' in the office for upward of 45 minutes. The more information that can be collected, the more complete the results will be.' "
"If an infant does not pass a hearing screen in the hospital, what happens next?","'Most hospital screening programs will refer infants who failed the initial screening test to a secondary center that specializes in more complete testing for diagnosis. Sometimes, simple problems, such as too much  residual amniotic fluid and vernix in the ear canal, will resolve prior to the rescreen and the infant will pass the second test. The rescreen is an important step in determining whether the infant is able to hear, so it should not be taken lightly.''If an infant does not pass the rescreen, then a full diagnostic test will be necessary. This test may be completed at the rescreen site or at another facility, depending on several factors.' "
"If an infant has a hearing loss, what is the next step?","'The ability of an infant to compensate for the hearing loss will depend on both the type and the degree of hearing loss.''The type of hearing loss refers to where in the ear the hearing loss is located and what is causing it. There are two basic types of hearing loss, conductive and sensorineural. A conductive loss is caused by problems in the outer or middle ear. This is the type of loss that results when a child has a middle-''ear infection'', trapped fluid from birth, impacted wax in the outer ear or malformation of the ear and associated structures. It is usually correctable with medical treatment or surgery. Occasionally, a conductive loss cannot be corrected with surgery. However, these children typically do extremely well with hearing aids. A sensorineural loss is indicative of a problem in the inner ear or somewhere along the nerve to the ear (auditory nerve). This type of loss is typically permanent and cannot be corrected with surgery. A hearing aid or a cochlear implant may be utilized in this situation.''The degree of hearing loss refers to the severity of the hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound. Although the term ""mild"" sounds relatively benign, a mild hearing loss in a child who is trying to develop speech and language can have a huge impact on his/her success.'""If the hearing loss, whether it is conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both, is determined to be uncorrectable by a physician, then the next step is to fit the infant with hearing aids. This is accomplished by a pediatric audiologist who can adjust the hearing aids according to the baby's hearing loss and monitor the infant's progress through regular visits. The infant should also be enrolled in an early childhood intervention program that is often provided through the school system.""""In addition to the early medical or surgical treatment of the hearing loss, parental involvement is essential. Parents need to monitor the child's progress and facilitate and encourage the use of the hearing aids and other therapeutic exercises that are designed to help the child become a careful listener and talker. Research has found that the one common denominator among successful hearing-impaired children is the parent's willingness to help the child throughout his/her lifetime.""'Summary & Recommendations (from the American Academy of Pediatrics Preventative Series Task Force -- July 2008)''Importance: Children with hearing loss have increased difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication skills, increased behavioral problems, decreased psychosocial well-being, and lower educational attainment compared with children with normal hearing.''Detection: Because half of the children with hearing loss have no identifiable risk factors, universal screening (instead of targeted screening) has been proposed to detect children with permanent congenital hearing loss.  There is good evidence that newborn hearing screening testing is highly accurate and leads to earlier identification and treatment of infants with hearing loss.''Benefits of detection and early treatment: Good quality evidence shows that early detection improves lingual outcomes.'

What should you know about jaundice in newborns and babies?,"'Jaundice'' is the yellowish discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and the whites of the eyes (sclerae) caused by elevated levels of ''bilirubin'' in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). The term ''jaundice'' is derived from the French word jaune, which means yellow. Jaundice is not technically a disease, but rather it is a visible sign of an underlying condition causing increased levels of bilirubin in the blood.''Jaundice symptoms in newborns include ''fever'', fussy eating, and looking ill.''Treatment for jaundice in newborns include phototherapy, tanning booths, and other treatments.' "
What is jaundice in newborns (neonatal jaundice)?,"'Neonatal'' jaundice is the most common condition requiring medical evaluation in a ''newborn'"". Though it is often a normal and transient physiologic consequence of the newborn's immature ""'liver'', there are a variety of other medical conditions which can cause severe neonatal jaundice. Jaundice in the newborn must be carefully monitored, as excessively elevated levels of bilirubin that go untreated for too long, can lead to permanent ''brain damage'' (a condition termed kernicterus).' "
What are the symptoms of jaundice in newborns?,"'Neonatal jaundice may be associated with various symptoms, depending upon the degree of elevation in bilirubin levels as well as the exact cause of the jaundice. The yellow discoloration of the skin will begin on the face and forehead and extend toward the ''feet'' as the levels of bilirubin increase. This characteristic progression of jaundice in infants can sometimes allow your health care professional to estimate the bilirubin level based on the location and extent of the jaundice, though this assessment can often be inaccurate.''The signs and symptoms associated with neonatal jaundice may include the following:''Kernicterus, which is caused by prolonged excessively elevated levels of bilirubin affecting the central nervous system, must be recognized and promptly treated as it can lead to permanent brain damage. Kernicterus is an irreversible and chronic condition which can include ''cerebral palsy'', ''hearing loss'', and intellectual impairment. Kernicterus has likely started to develop if the infant begins to exhibit extreme lethargy, changes in muscle tone, and a high-pitched cry.' Yellow discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and the whites of the eyes Light-colored stool Poor feeding Lethargy/excessive sleepiness Changes in muscle tone (either listless or stiff with arching of the back) High-pitched crying Seizures"
What causes jaundice in newborns?,"'Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, typically from an increased production of bilirubin or a decreased ability to metabolize and excrete it. Bilirubin is formed when ''red blood cells'' break down and is normally metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces.''Neonatal jaundice can be caused by several different conditions, and it is very commonly seen in newborns. The most common cause in newborns is physiologic jaundice, which affects most newborns and is usually benign. However, there are many other causes of neonatal jaundice that can be more serious, and require further medical evaluation and intervention. A newborn that develops jaundice within the first 24 hours of life requires immediate medical attention. The following are some of the causes of neonatal jaundice.' "
What are the types of neonatal jaundice?,"'Jaundice in newborns most commonly occurs because their livers are not mature enough to remove bilirubin from the blood. Jaundice may also be caused by a number of other medical conditions, for example, physiologic jaundice, neonatal jaundice, ''hemolysis'', ''polycythemia'', cephalohematoma, the infant swallowing during birth, mothers who have ''diabetes'', and Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility (Rh, ABO), ''breast milk'' and ''breastfeeding'', a collection of blood under the ''scalp'', and red blood cell enzyme and membrane defects.' "
What is physiologic jaundice?,"""This form of jaundice is usually evident on the second or third day of life. It is the most common cause of newborn jaundice and it is usually a transient and harmless condition. Physiologic jaundice is caused by the inability of the newborn's immature liver to metabolize (conjugate) and thus excrete bilirubin, which accumulates due to the breakdown of red blood cells which have a shorter life-span (70 to 90 days) than adult red blood cells (120 days). This increase in red blood cell breakdown and decreased ability to metabolize bilirubin overwhelms the newborns ability to properly process and excrete bilirubin. As the newborn's liver matures, however, the jaundice eventually disappears after 1 to 2 weeks."" "
"What is maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility (Rh, ABO)","""This form of jaundice occurs when there is incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus. This leads to increased bilirubin levels from the breakdown of the fetus' red blood cells (hemolysis)."" "
What is breast milk jaundice?,'This form of jaundice occurs in ''breastfed'' newborns and often appears at the end of the first week of life. Certain chemicals in breast milk are thought to be responsible. It is usually a harmless condition that resolves spontaneously. Mothers typically do not have to discontinue breastfeeding.' 
What is breastfeeding jaundice?,"'This form of jaundice occurs when the breastfed newborn does NOT receive adequate breast milk intake. This may occur because of delayed or insufficient milk production by the mother or because of poor feeding by the newborn. This inadequate intake results in ''dehydration'' and fewer bowel movements for the newborn, which results in decreased bilirubin excretion from the body.' "
What is cephalohematoma (a collection of blood under the scalp)?,"'Sometimes during the birthing process, the newborn may sustain a bruise or injury to the head, resulting in a blood collection/''blood clot'"" under the scalp. As this blood is naturally broken down, sudden elevated levels of bilirubin may overwhelm the processing capability of the newborn's immature liver, resulting in jaundice."" "
What are red blood cell enzyme defects?,"'Inherited'' genetic enzyme disorders, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (''G6PD deficiency'') or pyruvate kinase deficiency, for example, can lead to increased hemolysis and subsequent elevation in bilirubin levels.' "
Red blood cell membrane defects,"'Abnormalities in the membrane and shape of red blood cells (for example, spherocytosis) can lead to increased hemolysis.''Other causes of neonatal jaundice include prematurity, maternal ''diabetes'', polycythemia, infection/''sepsis'', ''hypothyroidism'', biliary atresia, ''cystic fibrosis'', Crigler-Najjar syndrome, ''Gilbert syndrome'', ''hepatitis'', ''thalassemia'', and galactosemia.' "
What are the risk factors for jaundice in newborns?,'Approximately 60% of all newborns develop jaundice; however newborns with certain risk factors are at higher risk for developing neonatal jaundice. Risks factors include the following:' Having siblings who have had neonatal jaundice Having parents of East Asian or Mediterranean descent Preterm babies Newborns with feeding difficulties/poor feeding Mother with diabetes Newborns with bruising/cephalohematoma Blood type incompatibility Congenital infection
How is jaundice in newborns diagnosed?,"'Neonatal jaundice can be diagnosed by examining the newborn and obtaining a blood test to check the total serum bilirubin level. Your health care professional should closely follow your newborn for the development of jaundice, and many hospitals routinely check total bilirubin levels on newborns prior to hospital discharge. Though the blood test is the most accurate, in certain instances, a transcutaneous bilirubin reading can be obtained by placing a handheld sensor against the newborns skin. If this reading is high, a blood test may be ordered to confirm the total bilirubin level. Bilirubin levels are usually highest at 3 of 5 days of life. Additional blood tests may be ordered for those newborns who require treatment and monitoring, or for those who may have other underlying conditions thought to be causing neonatal jaundice.' "
What is the treatment for jaundice in newborns?,"'The need to treat jaundice in newborns is determined by interpreting the total bilirubin level in relation to the newborns age in hours. If the level is deemed to be too high, or if it is rising too quickly, treatment is necessary. Sometimes, all that is needed for treatment is close monitoring of the bilirubin levels, and no further interventions may be necessary. In certain instances, treatment for neonatal jaundice can occur at home, while in other cases, admission to a hospital is necessary.''Based on the total bilirubin level, the underlying cause leading to jaundice, and the newborns clinical condition, various treatment modalities are available to treat jaundice in newborns. These include the following:' Feeding/hydration: By encouraging frequent feeding with breast milk or formula, newborns will produce more stool and urine, and thus eliminate bilirubin more rapidly from the body. Newborns may need to be fed up to 12 times per day, thus ensuring proper hydration and elimination. In certain instances, newborns may require observation in a hospital to receive intravenous fluids and closer monitoring of bilirubin levels. Phototherapy: This treatment is the most common for newborns requiring medical treatment for neonatal jaundice. Phototherapy (light treatment) involves placing the newborn under artificial blue lights with the baby undressed (wearing only a diaper) and using a special mask to protect the eyes. This treatment may occur in an open bassinet or warmer, or sometimes with a phototherapy blanket. These special lights work by converting bilirubin to lumirubin through a chemical reaction that occurs when the newborns skin is exposed to these special lights. This allows the newborn to more easily eliminate bilirubin from the body. Care needs to be taken to avoid excessive heat and dehydration. Phototherapy is used in hospitals, and in certain cases, newborns may be treated at home with phototherapy. Generally speaking, phototherapy is very safe and effective, and this treatment is successful for almost all newborns who require it. Phototherapy treatment is stopped once the newborns closely monitored bilirubin levels have decreased to appropriate values. Exchange transfusion: This urgent treatment is used in newborns with severe jaundice who may have failed phototherapy treatment or in those who are at higher risk of developing or have signs of kernicterus. During an exchange transfusion, the newborns blood is replaced with donated blood to rapidly decrease bilirubin levels. It is a more specialized procedure that is used on a case-by-case basis. Intravenous immunoglobulin: Administering this treatment may be used in select cases of significant neonatal jaundice due to maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility, and it may in some cases reduce the need for an exchange transfusion."
What are the complications of jaundice in newborns?,"'The complications associated with neonatal jaundice occur when bilirubin levels reach toxic levels, and the bilirubin gets into the central nervous system and damages the brain. The brain toxicity can either be reversible (early acute bilirubin ''encephalopathy'') or the damage may be permanent and irreversible (kernicterus). Permanent damage may lead to cerebral palsy, deafness, and intellectual impairment.' "
What is the prognosis of jaundice in newborns?,"'Generally speaking, the prognosis for newborns with jaundice is excellent if they receive the appropriate monitoring and treatment, and the vast majority of infants with neonatal jaundice will improve with no adverse effects. However, health care professionals need to remain vigilant and parents need be informed and educated about the potential dangers of severe hyperbilirubinemia in order to prevent the devastating consequences of kernicterus.' "
Can jaundice in newborns be prevented?,"'Some degree of jaundice in newborns is normal and not entirely preventable. However, the ''prevention'' of significant hyperbilirubinemia and its complications is possible through proper screening (obtaining bilirubin levels), identifying newborns at high-risk, close surveillance and monitoring of those infants with hyperbilirubinemia, parent education, and prompt treatment when deemed medically indicated.' "
What is the Apgar score?,"'Most term infants make a successful and uneventful transition from living within the womb to the outside world. Some will need some medical intervention, and very few will require extensive resuscitation. A reproducible and rapidly determined rating system is necessary for evaluation of the condition of the ''newborn'' infant. The Apgar score is a practical method for assessing a neonate.' "
How is the Apgar score done?,"'The Apgar score is a number calculated by scoring the ''heart'' rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, skin color, and reflex irritability (response to a catheter in the nostril). Each of these objective signs can receive 0, 1, or 2 points.' "
What does a high or low Apgar score mean?,'A perfect Apgar score of 10 means an infant is in the best possible condition. An infant with an Apgar score of 0-3 needs immediate resuscitation. It is important to note that diligent care of the newborn is an immediate response to the current status of the infant. It is inappropriate to wait until Apgar scores are obtained to begin or continue to address the needs of the neonate.' 
When is the Apgar scoring done?,"'The Apgar score is done routinely 60 seconds after the birth of the infant and then is repeated five minutes after birth.''In the event of a difficult resuscitation, the Apgar score may be done again at 10, 15, and 20 minutes.' "
What does a persistently low Apgar score mean?,"'The persistence of low (0-3) Apgar scores at 20 minutes of age is predictive of high rates of morbidity (disease) and mortality (death). In term infants, the five-minute Apgar score is predictive of mortality but is not as precise a predictor for neurologic and developmental disabilities. In high-risk (prematurity, low birth weight, etc.) infants, Apgar scores are less sensitive regarding long- term predictions of mental and neurological health.' "
Why was the Apgar score developed?,"'The score is named for the preeminent American anesthesiologist Dr. Virginia Apgar (1909-1974), who invented the scoring method in 1952. Having assisted at thousands of deliveries, Dr. Apgar wished to focus attention on the baby. ''Babies'"" were traditionally dispatched directly to the nursery, often without much formal scrutiny after delivery. Apgar wanted the baby to be assessed in an organized, meaningful manner by the delivery-room personnel. Dr. Apgar was the first woman to be appointed a full professor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons."" "
What is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of ""'cancer'' that originates in the cells of the lymphatic and immune systems, such as the blood cells known as lymphocytes and the ''lymph node'"" tissues. NHL is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. Another type of lymphatic cancer is Hodgkin's disease, which is a type of lymphoma (cancer of the ""'lymph nodes'""). NHL represents a group of different cancers that are different from Hodgkin's disease (see below).""""The lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system and helps fight infections and other diseases. In addition, the lymphatic system filters out bacteria, ""'viruses'', and other unwanted substances.''The lymphatic system consists of the following:''Lymph vessels'': These vessels branch out throughout the body similar to blood vessels.'""Because lymphatic tissue is found in many parts of the body, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can start almost anywhere.""   Lymph: The lymph vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph. Lymph contains white blood cells including a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes (such as B cells and T cells). Lymph nodes: Lymph vessels connect to small masses of lymph tissue called lymph nodes (small bean-shaped structures). Collections of lymph nodes are in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymph nodes store white blood cells. When you are ill and the lymph nodes are active, they will swell and be easily palpable (a doctor can feel them during an examination). Additional parts of the lymphatic system: The tonsils, thymus, and spleen are additional components of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic tissue is also in other parts of the body, including the stomach, skin, and small intestine."
What is the difference between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease (or Hodgkin's lymphoma)?,"'Both of these cancers are lymphomas, a cancer that begins in lymphocytes. The main difference is which subset of lymphocytes are involved. Doctors can establish this by looking at the cells under a microscope as well as with additional tests to characterize the ''tumor'"" cells. Distinguishing the type of lymphoma is important because treatment, disease course, and prognosis can be quite different. A microscopic examination can help to distinguish between the two lymphomas. The presence of characteristic cells called Reed-Sternberg cells would indicate a Hodgkin's lymphoma."" "
What causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""We don't know what causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL occurs when the body produces too many abnormal lymphocytes. In the normal life cycle of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), old lymphocytes die and the body creates new ones to replenish the supply. In NHL, lymphocytes grow indefinitely, so the number of circulating lymphocytes increases, filling up the lymph nodes and causing them to swell.""""Some diseases or syndromes can increase a person's risk for lymphomas (for example, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). In NHL, either B cells or T cells are involved in this process. These are the two subtypes of lymphocytes. B cells produce antibodies that fight infections. This is the most common type of cell involved in the NHL (B-cell lymphomas). T cells kill foreign substances directly. NHL less frequently originates from T cells. A low-grade NHL is an indolent form of the disease that progresses very slowly, while high-grade NHL is more likely to grow quickly (sometimes also referred to as ""'aggressive lymphoma'').''The following are some of the subtypes of NHL:'""Burkitt's lymphoma""': This lymphoma has two major subtypes: an African type closely associated with an infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' and the non-African, or sporadic, form that is not linked to the virus.''Cutaneous lymphoma'': This form of lymphoma involves the skin and can be classified as T-cell lymphoma or (less commonly) B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma makes up 4% of NHL cases.''Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma'': This represents the most common lymphoma (approximately 30% of NHL) and can be rapidly fatal if not treated.''Follicular lymphoma'': These lymphomas exhibit a specific growth pattern when viewed under the microscope (follicular or nodular pattern); they are usually advanced at the time of diagnosis.''Lymphoblastic lymphoma'': This is a rare form of lymphoma that accounts for about 2% of cases of NHL.''MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma'': This is a B-cell lymphoma that usually affects individuals in their 60s. The most common area for this lymphoma to develop is the stomach.''Mantle cell lymphoma'': One of the rarest of the NHL, mantle cell lymphoma accounts for about 6% of cases. This NHL is difficult to treat and is a subtype of B-cell lymphoma.''Adult T-cell lymphoma/''leukemia'"": This is a rare but aggressive NHL of the immune system's T cells. Human T-cell ""'leukemia''/lymphotropic virus type (HTLV-1) is the cause of this form of T-cell lymphoma.'""Waldenström's macroglobulinemia""': This is a rare and slow-growing form of NHL.''Anaplastic large cell lymphoma'': This is a rare type of NHL and a subtype of T-cell lymphoma.'

What are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk factors?,"""In many cases, people who develop NHL have no risk factors, and doctors seldom know why one person develops non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and another does not.""'Certain risk factors increase the chance that a person will develop this disease although most people who have these risk factors will never develop the disease.'""Medications that suppress the immune system: Using immunosuppressive agents (such as after an organ transplant) is a risk factor as it reduces the body's ability to fight infection.""'Weakened immune system: Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of developing lymphoma.''Certain infections: Certain viral and ''bacterial infections'' increase the risk of NHL. Examples are ''HIV'', ''hepatitis C'' virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. A type of bacteria sometimes linked to NHL is the ulcer-causing bacteria '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'').''Certain diseases: Having particular autoimmune diseases and/or ''type 2 diabetes'"" increase one's risk of developing NHL. Note: Lymphoma is not ""'contagious'"". It's impossible to catch lymphoma from another person.""""Age: Although non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can occur in young people, the chance of developing this disease increases with age. Most people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are older than 60 years of age.""""Other possible links: People who work with herbicides or certain other chemicals may be at increased risk of this disease. Researchers are also looking at a possible link between using hair dyes before 1980 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. None of these possible links have definitely been proven.""""Note: Having one or more risk factors does not mean that a person will develop non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop cancer."" "
What are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of NHL include the following:'   Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin Unexplained weight loss Fever Anemia (low red blood cell counts) Night sweats Coughing, trouble breathing, or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away (fatigue) Abdominal pain or swelling, or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Loss of appetite Itching of the skin"
What kind of doctors treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,'Blood cancer specialists (hematologists/oncologists) are the physician specialists who treat lymphomas. They can be part of a larger health care team that coordinates your care.' 
How do physicians diagnose non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Physical exam'': A doctor will complete a physical examination with a special emphasis on palpating the lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, and groin and establishing if they are swollen. He or she will also try to find out if there is swelling in the spleen or ''liver''. In most cases, ''swollen lymph nodes'' are signs of infection (rather than lymphoma), and a doctor will try to establish if there are any other signs of infection and what the source of the infection could be.''Medical history'"": A doctor will ask questions concerning one's past medical history and about risk factors for NHL.""'Blood tests'': Doctors perform a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') to check the number of white blood cells. Additional tests might include a lactate dehydrogenase level (can be elevated in lymphoma). A physician may perform additional tests to rule out an infection causing the swollen lymph nodes.''Imaging procedures'': A ''chest X-ray'' or ''CT scan'' of the chest or neck might help detect the presence of tumors or more ''enlarged lymph nodes''. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a newer modality to help detect NHL.''Biopsy'': A doctor might recommend a biopsy of lymph nodes to diagnose the cause of the swelling. A pathologist will review the samples under the microscope and establish a diagnosis.''There are three ways to diagnose a lymph node: removal of the entire lymph node (excisional biopsy); partial removal of a lymph node (incisional biopsy); fine-needle aspiration (using a thin needle to remove some lymph node tissue) is often not diagnostic as not enough tissue is removed for the pathologist to make a diagnosis.''Bone marrow biopsy'': A bone marrow biopsy can establish the spread of the disease. This involves the insertion of a needle into bone to obtain bone marrow. In adults, the most common site for this biopsy is the pelvic bone.' "
"What are the types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and how is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma staging determined?","'There are many different types of NHL classifications. Several classification systems exist for NHL, including the Revised European American Lymphoma Classification, which is the foundation for the WHO lymphoma classification. The classifications use cell types and defining other characteristics. There are three large groups: the B cell, T cell, and natural killer cell tumors.''Newer techniques such as immunophenotyping (a way to study the proteins on a cell and identify the precise types of B or T cells that are involved) diagnose and classify lymphomas. This technique is especially useful in the case of B-cell lymphomas.''Testing of DNA from the lymphoma detects gene defects that help determine the prognosis and response to treatment.''To plan the best treatment for NHL, a health care provider needs to stage (know the extent of) the disease. This is an attempt to find out what part of the body is involved.''Different tests are involved in the staging process, and they can include the following:''Doctors will also stage the lymphoma based on spread of the disease and organ involvement as well as symptoms:' Bone marrow biopsy (see above) CT scan MRI Ultrasound PET scan: A health care professional injects radioactive material, and a CT scan is performed to determine the metabolism of this material. Lymphoma cells show faster metabolism than normal cells, and areas with lymphoma look brighter on the pictures. Stage I: The cells are found in only one lymph node area (such as in the neck or axilla). Or, if the abnormal cells are not in the lymph nodes, they are in only one part of a tissue or organ (such as the lung, but not the liver or bone marrow). Stage II: A physician finds lymphoma cells in at least two lymph node areas on the same side of the body or only above or below the diaphragm. Or the cells are in one organ and the lymph nodes affected are near that organ. Stage III: The lymphoma is in lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The lymphoma may spread into an organ near this lymph node group. Stage IV: In addition to lymph cell spread, doctors find lymphoma cells in several parts of one or more organs or tissues. A: No symptoms (The individual has not had weight loss, fever, or night sweats.) B: Presence of any of the following symptoms: weight loss (10% or more in the last six months), fever (greater than 101.5 F) night sweats, or severe itching"
What is the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'A doctor will usually refer a patient to an oncologist for evaluation and treatment. Some large academic medical centers have oncologists who specialize in lymphomas.''The treatment plan depends mainly on the following:'""If one has a slow-growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without symptoms, one may not require treatment for the cancer right away. A health care team closely watches the individual. These cancers might not require treatment for years, although close follow-up is necessary. If the ""'indolent lymphoma'' produces symptoms, therapy will usually consist of chemotherapy and biological therapy. Stage I and II often require ''radiation'' therapy.''A combination of chemotherapy, biological therapy, and sometimes radiation therapy may be necessary for an aggressive type of lymphoma.''If treatment is required, there are several options used alone or in combination:''Chemotherapy'': Health care professionals administer this drug treatment either as an injection or oral form that kills cancer cells. This treatment can involve one medication or multiple medications, and health care professionals may give it alone or in conjunction with other therapies. This therapy is given in cycles, alternating treatment periods and non-treatment periods. The repetition of these cycles and the number of cycles will be determined by an oncologist based on the staging of the cancer and the medications used. Chemotherapy also harms normal cells that divide rapidly. This can lead to ''hair loss'', GI symptoms, and difficulty with the immune system.''Radiation therapy'': High doses of radiation kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Health care professionals use this modality alone or in conjunction with other therapies. Side effects usually depend on the type and dosage of the therapy as well as the area undergoing radiation therapy. Universally, patients tend to get tired during radiation therapy, especially toward the later stages of treatment.''Stem cell transplant'': This procedure allows a patient to receive large doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill the lymphoma cells that might survive standard levels of therapy. Physicians use this therapy if the lymphoma returns after treatment. For this therapy, one needs to be admitted to the hospital. After the therapy, a doctor injects healthy ''stem cells'' (that were either taken from you before the therapy or from a donor) to form a new immune system.''Biological ''drugs'"": These medications enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancers. Monoclonal antibodies treat NHL. Health care professionals administer the therapy via an IV, and the monoclonal antibodies bind to the cancer cells and augment the immune system's ability to destroy cancer cells. ""'Rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') is such a drug used in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Side effects for this treatment are usually ''flu-like symptoms''. Rarely, a person can have a severe reaction, including a drop in ''blood pressure'' or difficulty breathing. R-CHOP therapy or regimen is an example of a common regimen used to treat NHL. It involves a combination of chemotherapy and biological therapy drugs (rituximab; ''cyclophosphamide''; doxorubicin hydrochloride; vincristine sulfate) and ''prednisone''.''Radio immunotherapy medications'': These are made of monoclonal antibodies that transport radioactive materials directly to cancer cells. Because the radioactive material is traveling and binding directly to the cancer cell, the cancer cell absorbs more radiation. Ibritumomab (''Zevalin'') and tositumomab (Bexxar) are two drugs approved for this use in lymphomas. Side effects usually include getting very tired or experiencing ''flu-like'' symptoms.''In addition to medical therapies, patients will also require supportive care. One should have the opportunity to learn about the disease and the treatment options and discuss this with a care team. Most cancer centers will have support groups where one can share concerns with other patients and learn from their experiences.''Some patients find moderate physical activity helpful. Discuss with a doctor what kind of activities are appropriate.''Eating the appropriate amounts of foods, as well as the right foods, is an important part of treatment. Speaking with a nutritionist can be very helpful.''In addition, researchers linked vitamin deficiencies (especially ''vitamin D'') to worse survival in some subgroups of cancer patients. Patients should discuss their nutritional requirements with their health care team.''Appropriate caloric intake is important especially if ''nausea'' is present due to your treatments. Some people find that ''exercise'' can help their ''nausea'' during therapy. ''Acupuncture'' has also shown to decrease the side effects of cancer treatments.'

What is the prognosis and survival rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'The prognosis of NHL can be good but depends on the type of lymphoma, the extent of spread (staging), and response to therapy. A health care provider will discuss the prognosis with the patient. The overall five-year survival rate for people with NHL is 71%, while the overall 10-year survival rate is 60%.''The National Cancer Institute reports the following average five-year survival by stage:'""Five-year survival is a measure used to predict and gauge the severity of the cancer. Patients should discuss risk factors, staging, and classifications with their health care team as none of these numbers apply to an individual patient without considering all the circumstances of the patient's illness.""  "
Is it possible to prevent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""Most people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have no identifiable risk factors. This makes it difficult to prevent the disease.""'Most known causes of lymphoma are difficult to avoid, such as medications that suppress the immune system, as they are usually life-saving medications needed for other reasons.' "
What is the latest research on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Research on NHL focuses on three aspects:' Early detection of the disease: This work is looking at DNA changes in lymphoma and how to test for these changes. Prevention: Studies are under way to examine what causes normal lymphocytes to develop into lymphoma cells and how to prevent this. Treatment: Better treatment modalities and protocols are always being tested. Chemotherapy: Newer drugs and protocols for administration are being studied in clinical trials at many different medical centers. Other therapies are being developed and/or further advanced such as new, improving bone marrow and stem cell transplant methods as well as advances in the development and use of monoclonal antibody therapies and targeted therapies.

What Is Tobacco Addiction?,"'When people are addicted, they have a compulsive need to seek out and use a substance, even when they understand the harm it can cause. Tobacco products -- cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and ''smokeless tobacco'' -- can all be addictive. Everyone knows that ''smoking'' is bad for you, and most people that do it want to quit. In fact, nearly 35 million people make a serious attempt to quit each year. Unfortunately, most who try to quit on their own relapse -- often within a week. ' "
Is Nicotine Addictive?,"'Yes. It is actually the nicotine in tobacco that is addictive. Each ''cigarette'' contains about 10 milligrams of nicotine. Because the smoker inhales only some of the smoke from a cigarette, and not all of each puff is absorbed in the ''lungs'', a smoker gets about 1 to 2 milligrams of the drug from each cigarette. Although that may not seem like much, it is enough to make someone addicted. ' "
Is Nicotine the Only Harmful Part of Tobacco?,"'No. Nicotine is only one of more than 4,000 chemicals, many of which are poisonous, found in the smoke from tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco products also contain many toxins, as well as high levels of nicotine. Many of these other ingredients are things we would never consider putting in our bodies, like tar, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, and nitrosamines. Tar causes ''lung cancer'', ''emphysema'', and bronchial diseases. Carbon monoxide causes ''heart'' problems, which is one reason why ''smokers'' are at high risk for ''heart disease''. ' "
How Is Tobacco Used?,"'Tobacco can be smoked in cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. It can be chewed or, if powdered, sniffed. ""Bidis"" are an alternative cigarette. They originally came from India and were hand-rolled. In the United States, bidis were popular with ''teens'' because they come in colorful packages with flavor choices. Some teens think that bidis are less harmful than regular cigarettes, but in fact they have more nicotine, which may make people smoke more, giving bidis the potential to be even more harmful than cigarettes. ''Hookah'' -- or water pipe ''smoking'' -- practiced for centuries in other countries, has recently become popular among teens in the United States as well. Hookah tobacco comes in many flavors, and the pipe is typically passed around in groups. Although many hookah smokers think it is less harmful than ''smoking'' cigarettes, water pipe smoking still delivers the addictive drug nicotine and is at least as toxic as cigarette smoking. ' "
What Are the Common Street Names?,"'You might hear cigarettes referred to as ""smokes,"" ""cigs,"" or ""butts."" Smokeless tobacco is often called ""chew,"" ""dip,"" ""spit tobacco,"" ""snus,"" or ""''snuff''."" People may refer to hookah smoking as ""narghile,"" ""argileh,"" ""shisha,"" ""hubble-bubble,"" or ""goza."" ' "
How Many Teens Use It?,"""The good news is that smoking is at historically low levels among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, according to NIDA's Monitoring the Future study. In 2011, rates for smoking in the past month were reported as 18.7 percent for 12th graders, 11.8 percent for 10th graders, and 6.1 percent for 8th graders. ""'Use of smokeless tobacco had been showing a decline over the past decade -- until 2009, when use began to rise. According to the study, in 2011 current use of smokeless tobacco among 8th graders was 3.5 percent and 6.6 percent among 10th graders. Among 12th graders, 8.3 percent reported using smokeless tobacco in the last month, a number not seen since the late 1990s. ' "
How Does Tobacco Deliver Its Effects?,"'With each puff of a cigarette, a smoker pulls nicotine and other harmful substances into the lungs, where it is absorbed into the blood. It takes just 8 seconds for nicotine to hit the brain. Nicotine happens to be shaped like the natural brain chemical acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is one of many chemicals called neurotransmitters that carry messages between brain cells. Neurons (brain cells) have specialized proteins called receptors, into which specific neurotransmitters can fit, like a key fitting into a lock. Nicotine locks into acetylcholine receptors, rapidly causing changes in the brain and body. For instance, nicotine increases ''blood pressure'', heart rate, and ''respiration'' (''breathing''). ''Nicotine also attaches to acetylcholine receptors on neurons that release a neurotransmitter called ''dopamine''. Dopamine is released normally when you experience something pleasurable like good food, your favorite activity, or the company of people you love. But smoking cigarettes causes neurons to release excess dopamine, which is responsible for the feelings of pleasure. However, this effect wears off rapidly, causing people who smoke to get the urge to light up again for another dose of the drug. '""Nicotine may be the primary addictive component in tobacco but it's not the only ingredient that is biologically important. Using advanced neuroimaging technology, scientists have found that people who smoke have a significant reduction in the levels of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain and throughout the body. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of dopamine, other neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation, and in a variety of bodily functions. Having lower amounts of MAO in the brain may lead to higher dopamine levels and be another reason that people who smoke continue to do so -- to sustain the pleasurable feelings that high dopamine levels create. ""'Also, researchers have recently shown in animals that acetaldehyde, another chemical constituent of tobacco smoke, dramatically increases the rewarding properties of nicotine -- particularly in adolescent animals -- which may be one reason why teens are more vulnerable to becoming addicted to tobacco than adults. ' "
What Happens When Someone Uses Tobacco for Long Periods of Time?,"'Long-term use of nicotine frequently leads to ''addiction''. Research is just beginning to document all of the changes in the brain that accompany nicotine addiction. The behavioral consequences of these changes are well documented, however. ''The way that nicotine is absorbed and metabolized by the body enhances its addictive potential. Each ''inhalation'' brings a rapid distribution of nicotine to the brain -- peaking within 10 seconds and then disappearing quickly, along with the associated pleasurable feelings. Over the course of the day, tolerance develops -- meaning that higher (or more frequent) doses are required to produce the same initial effects. Some of this tolerance is lost overnight, and people who smoke often report that the first cigarette of the day is the strongest or the ""best."" ''When a person quits smoking, they usually experience withdrawal symptoms, which often drive them back to tobacco use. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms include irritability, cognitive and attentional deficits, ''sleep'' disturbances, increased appetite, and craving. Craving -- an intense urge for nicotine that can persist for 6 months or longer -- is an important but poorly understood component of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome. Some people describe it as a major stumbling block to quitting. ''Withdrawal symptoms usually peak within the first few days and may subside within a few weeks. The withdrawal syndrome is related to the pharmacological effects of nicotine, but many behavioral factors also affect the severity and persistence of withdrawal symptoms. For example, the cues associated with smoking -- the end of a meal, the sight or smell of a cigarette, the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette, the people you hung out with when you smoked, and ''alcohol'' use -- all can be powerful triggers of craving that can last or re-emerge months or even years after smoking has ceased. While nicotine gum and patches may stop the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. ' "
What Are Other Adverse Health Effects?,"'Tobacco abuse harms every organ in the body. It has been conclusively linked to ''leukemia'', ''cataracts'', and ''pneumonia'', and accounts for about one-third of all  ''cancer'' deaths. The overall rates of death from ''cancer'"" are twice as high among people who smoke as those who don't, with people who smoke heavily having rates that are four times greater than those of people who """"don't smoke""'. And, you guessed it -- foremost among the ''cancers'' caused by tobacco use is ''lung cancer''. In fact, ''cigarette smoking'' has been linked to about 90 percent of all lung ''cancer'' cases, the number-one cancer killer of both men and women. Tobacco abuse is also associated with cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, ''esophagus'', stomach, pancreas, cervix, kidney, ureter, and bladder. '""People who smoke also lose some of their sense of smell and taste, don't have the same stamina for ""'exercise'' and sports they once did, and may smell of smoke. After smoking for a long time, people find that their skin ages faster and their ''teeth'' discolor or turn brown. ''Smoking doesn\'t just affect the person who smokes. People who do not smoke are exposed to ""''secondhand smoke'',"" which comes from both the exhaled smoke and from the smoke floating from the end of a cigarette, ''cigar'', or pipe. Inhaling ''secondhand smoke'"" increases a person's risk of developing ""'heart disease'' by 25 to 30 percent and lung cancer by 20 to 30 percent. In fact, secondhand smoke is estimated to contribute to as many as 40,000 deaths related to ''heart disease'' and about 3,000 lung cancer deaths per year among people who do not smoke. Secondhand smoke also causes respiratory problems in people who do not smoke, like ''coughing'', ''phlegm'', and reduced lung function. ''Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more severe ''asthma''. And, believe it or not, dropped cigarettes are the leading cause of residential fire fatalities, leading to more than 700 such deaths each year.''Each year, almost half a million Americans die from tobacco use. One of every five deaths, or about 440,000 deaths, in the United States is a result of tobacco use, making tobacco more lethal than all other addictive ''drugs'' combined.' "
Smoking and Pregnancy: What Are the Risks?,"'In the United States between 2009 and 2010, 22.7 percent of teens age 15 to 17 smoked cigarettes during their ''pregnancies''. Carbon monoxide and nicotine from tobacco smoke may interfere with fetal oxygen supply -- and because nicotine readily crosses the placenta, it can reach concentrations in the fetus that are much higher than maternal levels. Nicotine concentrates in fetal blood, amniotic fluid, and ''breast milk'', exposing both fetuses and infants to toxic effects. These factors can have severe consequences for the fetuses and infants of mothers who smoke, including increased risk for ''stillbirth'', infant mortality,  ''sudden infant death syndrome'', preterm birth, and respiratory problems. In addition, smoking more than a pack a day during ''pregnancy'' nearly doubles the risk that the affected child will become addicted to tobacco if that child starts smoking. ' "
How Is Tobacco Addiction Treated?,"'The good news is that treatments for tobacco addiction do work. Although some people who smoke can quit without help, many people need help. Behavioral treatment programs help people learn about and change their behaviors using self-help materials, counselor-staffed telephone ""quitlines,"" and individual therapy. ''Over-the-counter'' medications, such as the ''nicotine patch'"", gum, inhalers, and lozenges, replace nicotine and relieve the symptoms of withdrawal. It is important to know that nicotine replacement medicines can be safely used as a medication when taken properly. They have lower overall nicotine levels than tobacco and they have little abuse potential since they do not produce the pleasurable effects of tobacco products. They also don't contain the carcinogens and gases found in tobacco smoke, making them a good treatment approach for quitting. ""'There are also prescription medications now available for ''smoking cessation'', such as ''bupropion'' (''Zyban'') and ''varenicline'' tartrate (''Chantix''), that have been shown to help people quit. But research shows that the most effective way to ''quit smoking'' is to use both medications and behavioral treatment programs. ''The bottom line: People who ''quit smoking'"" can have immediate health benefits. Believe it or not, within 24 hours of quitting, a person's blood pressure decreases and they have less of a chance of having a ""'heart attack''. Over the long haul, quitting means less chance of ''stroke'', lung and other cancers, and coronary heart disease, and more chance for a long and healthy life. '  "
What If a Person Wants To Quit?,"'If someone you know is smoking or using tobacco in another way, encourage him or her to talk to a parent, school guidance counselor, or other trusted adult. A national toll-free number, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669), can help people get the information they need to ''quit smoking'"". Callers to the number are routed to their state's smoking cessation quitline or, in states that have not established quitlines, to one maintained by the National Cancer Institute. In addition, a Web site -- ""'www.smokefree.gov'' -- from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers online advice and downloadable information to make stopping easier. '  "
What is Niemann-Pick disease?,"'Niemann-Pick disease types A and B is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene. This gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called acid sphingomyelinase. This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are compartments within cells that break down and recycle different types of molecules. Acid sphingomyelinase is responsible for the conversion of a fat (''lipid'') called sphingomyelin into another type of ''lipid'' called ceramide. Mutations in SMPD1 lead to a shortage of acid sphingomyelinase, which results in reduced break down of sphingomyelin, causing this fat to accumulate in cells. This fat buildup causes cells to malfunction and eventually die. Over time, cell loss impairs function of tissues and organs including the brain, ''lungs'', spleen, and ''liver'' in people with Niemann-Pick disease types A and B.''Mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene cause Niemann-Pick disease type C. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in the movement of ''lipids'' within cells. Mutations in these genes lead to a shortage of functional protein, which prevents movement of ''cholesterol'' and other ''lipids'', leading to their accumulation in cells. Because these lipids are not in their proper location in cells, many normal cell functions that require lipids (such as cell membrane formation) are impaired. The accumulation of lipids as well as the cell dysfunction eventually leads to cell death, causing the tissue and organ damage seen in Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2.' "
What is the Niemann-Pick disease inheritance pattern?,"'This condition is ''inherited'' in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "
What other names are used for Niemann-Pick disease?, lipid histiocytosis neuronal cholesterol lipidosis neuronal lipidosis NPD sphingomyelin lipidosis sphingomyelin/cholesterol lipidosis sphingomyelinase deficiency
"What are the types, symptoms and signs of Niemann-Pick disease?","'Niemann-Pick disease'' is a condition that affects many body systems. It has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity. Niemann-''Pick disease'' is divided into four main types: ''type A'', type B, type C1, and type C2. These types are classified on the basis of genetic cause and the signs and symptoms of the condition.''Infants with Niemann-Pick disease type A usually develop an ''enlarged liver'' and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) by age 3 months and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). The affected children develop normally until around age 1 year when they experience a progressive loss of mental abilities and movement (psychomotor regression). Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A also develop widespread lung damage (''interstitial lung disease'') that can cause recurrent lung infections and eventually lead to respiratory failure. All affected children have an eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination. Children with Niemann-Pick disease type A generally do not survive past early childhood.''Niemann-Pick disease type B usually presents in mid-childhood. The signs and symptoms of this type are similar to type A, but not as severe. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B often have hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent lung infections, and a low number of platelets in the blood (''thrombocytopenia''). They also have ''short stature'' and slowed mineralization of bone (delayed bone age). About one-third of affected individuals have the cherry-red spot eye abnormality or neurological impairment. People with Niemann-Pick disease type B usually survive into adulthood.''The signs and symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are very similar; these types differ only in their genetic cause. Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 usually become apparent in childhood, although signs and symptoms can develop at any time. People with these types usually develop difficulty coordinating movements (''ataxia''), an inability to move the eyes vertically (vertical supranuclear gaze palsy), poor muscle tone (''dystonia''), severe ''liver disease'', and ''interstitial lung disease''. Individuals with Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 have problems with speech and swallowing that worsen over time, eventually interfering with feeding. Affected individuals often experience progressive decline in intellectual function and about one-third have ''seizures''. People with these types may survive into adulthood.' "
What is the frequency of Niemann-Pick disease?,"'Niemann-Pick disease types A and B is estimated to affect 1 in 250,000 individuals. Niemann-Pick disease type A occurs more frequently among individuals of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish descent than in the general population. The incidence within the Ashkenazi population is approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals.''Combined, Niemann-Pick disease types C1 and C2 are estimated to affect 1 in 150,000 individuals; however, type C1 is by far the more common type, accounting for 95 percent of cases. The disease occurs more frequently in people of French-Acadian descent in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, a population of affected French-Acadians were previously designated as having Niemann-Pick disease type D, however, it was shown that these individuals have mutations in the gene associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1.' "
What is the treatment for Niemann-Pick disease?,"""There is currently no cure for Niemann-Pick disease. Treatment is supportive. Children usually die from infection or progressive neurological loss. There is currently no effective treatment for persons with type A. Bone marrow transplantation has been attempted in a few individuals with type B. The development of enzyme replacement and gene therapies might also be helpful for those with type B. Restricting one's ""'diet'' does not prevent the buildup of lipids in cells and tissues.' "
What is the prognosis of Niemann-Pick disease?,"'Infants with type A die in infancy. Children with type B may live a comparatively long time, but may require supplemental oxygen because of lung impairment. The life expectancy of persons with type C varies: some individuals die in childhood while others who appear to be less severely affected can live into adulthood.' "
What are night sweats?,"'Doctors in primary care fields of medicine often hear their patients complain of night sweats because they are common. Night sweats refer to any excess\xa0''sweating''\xa0occurring during the night. However, if you keep your bedroom temperature unusually hot or you are sleeping in too many clothes, you may sweat during your\xa0''sleep'"", which is normal. In order to distinguish night sweats that arise from medical causes from those that occur because one's surroundings are too warm, doctors generally refer to true night sweats as severe\xa0""'hot flashes''\xa0occurring at night that can drench sleepwear and sheets, which are not related to an overheated environment.''In one study of 2267 patients visiting a primary care doctor, 41% reported experiencing night sweats during the previous month, so the perception of\xa0''excessive sweating''\xa0at night is common. It is important to note that flushing (a warmth and redness of the face or trunk) also may be hard to distinguish from true night sweats.' "
What are other signs and symptoms of night sweats?,"'Depending upon the underlying cause of the night sweats, other symptoms may occur in association with the ''sweating''. For example:' Certain infections and cancers Shaking and chills can sometimes occur if you have a fever. Unexplained weight loss due to lymphoma. Night sweats due to the menopausal transition are typically accompanied by other symptoms of menopause such as vaginal dryness, daytime hot flashes, and mood changes. Night sweats that occur as a side effect of medications can be accompanied by other medication side effects, depending upon the specific drug. Conditions that result in increased sweating in general (as opposed to only night sweats) will result in increased sweating at other hours of the day."

Conditions that result in increased sweating in general (as opposed to only night sweats) will result in increased sweating at other hours of the day."
Perimenopause and Menopause,'The hot flashes that accompany the menopausal transition can occur at night and cause sweating. This is a very common cause of night sweats in perimenopausal women. It is important to remember that hot flashes and other symptoms of the ''perimenopause'' can precede the actual ''menopause'' (the cessation of menstrual periods) by several years.'  
Hormone disorders,"'Sweating or flushing can be seen with several hormone disorders, including ''pheochromocytoma'' (a type of ''adrenal gland tumor'' that overproduces hormones known as catecholamines), ''carcinoid syndrome'' (overproduction of certain hormones by tumors of the lung or gastrointestinal system), and ''hyperthyroidism'' (excessive levels of thyroid hormones).' "
Idiopathic hyperhidrosis,'Idiopathic ''hyperhidrosis'' is a condition in which the body chronically produces too much sweat without any identifiable medical cause.' 
Infections,"'Classically, ''tuberculosis'' is the infection most commonly associated with night sweats. However, ''bacterial infections'', such as the following conditions can also be associated with night sweats:' endocarditis (inflammation of the heart valves), osteomyelitis (inflammation within the bones due to infection), abscesses (for example, boils, appendix, tonsils, perianal, peritonsillar, diverticulitis), and AIDS virus (HIV) infection."
Cancers,"'Night sweats are an early symptom of some cancers. The most common type of\xa0''cancer''\xa0associated with night sweats is lymphoma. However, people who have an undiagnosed\xa0''cancer''\xa0frequently have other symptoms as well, such as unexplained ''weight loss'' and fever.' "
Antidepressants,"'Taking certain medications can lead to night sweats. In cases without other physical symptoms or signs of ''tumor'' or infection, medications are often determined to be the cause of night sweats.''Antidepressant'' medications are a common type of medication that can lead to night sweats. All types of ''antidepressants'' including ''tricyclic antidepressants'', selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the newer agents, ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') can cause night sweats as a side effect, with a range in incidence from 8% to 22% of persons taking antidepressant ''drugs''. Other psychiatric drugs have also been associated with night sweats.' "
Other medications,"'Medicine taken to lower fever (antipyretics) such as ''aspirin'' and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) can sometimes lead to sweating.''Other types of drugs can cause flushing (redness of the skin, typically over the cheeks and neck), which, as mentioned above, may be confused with night sweats. Some of the many drugs that can cause flushing include:''Many other drugs not mentioned above, including cortisone, ''prednisone'', and ''prednisolone'', may also be associated with flushing or night sweats.' niacin (Niacor, Niaspan, Slo-Niacin - taken in the higher doses used for lipid disorders)], tamoxifen (Nolvadex) hydralazine, nitroglycerine, and sildenafil (Viagra)."
Neurologic conditions,"'Uncommonly, neurologic conditions may cause increased sweating and possibly lead to night sweats including' autonomic dysreflexia, post-traumatic syringomyelia, stroke, and autonomic neuropathy."
Night sweats treatment,"'The treatment for night sweats depends upon the underlying cause.''In summary, night sweats are usually a harmless annoyance; however, they are sometimes a sign of an underlying medical condition. Persons with unexplained night sweats should seek medical care.'  "
Which types of doctors treat night sweats?,"'Night sweats are commonly treated by internists, family practice specialists, or gynecologists. If they are related to specific medical conditions, other specialists, including endocrinologists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, or oncologists, may be involved in the care of patients with night sweats.' "
Nightmares and PTSD,"'Nightmares are dreams that are threatening and scary. Nearly everyone has had a nightmare from time to time. For ''trauma'' survivors, though, nightmares are a common problem. Along with flashbacks and unwanted memories, nightmares are one of the ways in which a trauma survivor may relive the trauma for months or years after the event.' "
How common are nightmares after trauma?,"'Among the general public, about 5% of people complain of nightmares. Those who have gone through a trauma, though, are more likely to have distressing nightmares after the event. This is true no matter what type of trauma it is.''Those trauma survivors who get ''PTSD'' are even more likely to complain of nightmares. Nightmares are one of the 17 symptoms of ''PTSD''. For example, a study comparing Vietnam Veterans to civilians showed that 52% of combat Veterans with PTSD had nightmares fairly often. Only 3% of the civilians in the study reported that same level of nightmares.''Other research has found even higher rates of nightmares. Of those with PTSD, 71-96% may have nightmares. People who have other ''mental health'' problems, such as ''panic disorder'', as well as PTSD are more likely to have nightmares than those with PTSD alone.''Not only are trauma survivors more likely to have nightmares, those who do may have them quite often. Some survivors may have nightmares several times a week.' "
What do nightmares that follow trauma look like?,"'Nightmares that follow trauma often involve the same scary elements that were in the trauma. For example, someone who went through Hurricane Katrina may have dreams about high winds or floods. They may dream about trying to escape the waters or being in a shelter that does not feel safe. A survivor of a hold-up might have nightmares about the robber or about being held at gunpoint.''Not all nightmares that occur after trauma are a direct replay of the event. About half of those who have nightmares after trauma have dreams that replay the trauma. People with PTSD are more likely to have dreams that are exact replays of the event than are survivors without PTSD. ''Lab research has shown that nightmares after trauma are different in some ways from nightmares in general. Nightmares after trauma may occur earlier in the night and during different stages of ''sleep''. They are more likely to have body movements along with them. ' "
Nightmares and cultural differences,"'Nightmares may be viewed differently in different cultures. For example, in some cultures nightmares are thought to mean that the dreamer is open to physical or spiritual harm. In other cultures, it is believed that the dreams may contain messages from spirits or may forecast the future. These beliefs may lead those with nightmares to use certain practices in an effort to protect themselves. ' "
Are there any effective treatments for posttraumatic nightmares?,"'Nightmare symptoms often get better with standard PTSD treatment. If nightmares persist, there are treatments that can reduce how often they occur. ''One treatment is Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT). In IRT, the person who is having nightmares, while awake, changes how the nightmare ends so that it no longer upsets them. Then the person replays over and over in their minds the new dream with the non-scary ending. Research shows that this type of treatment can reduce how often nightmares occur.''Also, treatment for ''breathing'' problems that occur during ''sleep'' may reduce the nightmares that follow trauma. High levels of sleep-disordered breathing have been seen in trauma survivors. In one study, patients given a treatment to improve their breathing during sleep no longer had violent, scary dreams. ''Little research exists on the use of medicines to treat nightmares from trauma. The medicine with the most promise is ''prazosin''. Two studies have found that prazosin reduces nightmare symptoms. More research on prazosin is under way. '  "

What is Nipah virus infection (NiV)?,'Nipah virus infection is a zoonosis transferred by contact with an NiV-infected animal or person or their secretions that has a high fatality rate in infected humans.' 
What causes a Nipah virus infection?,'Nipah virus causes NiV.' 
Is a Nipah virus infection contagious?,"'Yes, the virus is moderately ''contagious'' as it needs close contact and usually infects the family members and/or medical caregivers of NiV-infected individuals.' "
What is the incubation period for a Nipah virus infection?,"'The incubation period (time from initial exposure to virus to when symptoms begin) for NiV usually varies from about five to 14 days. There have been a few cases with much longer incubation periods, as long as 45 days.' "
What is the contagious period for a Nipah virus infection?,"'Doctors do not completely understand the contagious period for infection, but it likely begins during the incubation period (proven in pigs) and continues until the patient stops shedding virus. In most patients, this occurs when the symptoms and signs of the infection are diminished or gone.' "
What are risk factors for a Nipah virus infection?,"'The risk factors for this infection include having close contact with infected animals such as pigs, bats, and/or humans infected with the virus. In addition, consumption of raw date palm sap is a significant risk factor since bat excrement often contaminates this substance.' "
What are signs and symptoms of a Nipah virus infection?,"'The signs and symptoms of NiV infection begin with''Encephalitis follows and those infected may exhibit drowsiness, disorientation, mental ''confusion'', altered consciousness, and ''seizures'' that can progress, within 24-48 hours, to ''coma'' and eventually death.'  fever and headache, myalgia (muscle aches), sore throat, vomiting, dizziness and/or acute respiratory syndrome or atypical pneumonia."
What tests diagnose a Nipah virus infection?,"'A combination of tests diagnose NiV. Viral isolation, RT-''PCR'', and antibody detection by the ''ELISA tests'' are the tests that health care professionals use most often to diagnose Nipah virus infection.' "
What are treatments for a Nipah virus infection?,"'According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), supportive care is the only current treatment for this viral infection. There is no ''vaccine'' specifically available to protect humans. However, some researchers suggest that the antiviral drug ribavirin may be useful, but there is little or no data to support this. A human monoclonal antibody that targets the G glycoprotein of NiV has shown benefit in a ferret animal model of this disease, but researchers have not studied the effects of the antibody in humans.' "
What is the prognosis of a Nipah virus infection?,"'The prognosis of NiV infections is fair to poor. The fatality rate is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to range from 40%-75%, depending upon the local capabilities for surveillance and clinical management (supportive care). Survivors may have residual neurological problems such as ''seizures'' and/or personality changes. A few survivors who recover may subsequently relapse or develop delayed onset encephalitis.' "
Is there a way to prevent Nipah virus infections?,"'There are ways to reduce the risk of developing NiV infections. For example, individuals should avoid date palm sap and any bats or potentially infected domestic animals such as infected pigs. The WHO suggests that health care professionals wear gloves and other protective clothing during any pig slaughtering and culling procedures. Avoid contagion, the communication of disease from one person to another by close contact. Medical caregivers should employ quarantine methods and use barrier methods such as gloves, masks, and disposable gowns, as they are at high risk of person-to-person transmission of NiV.' "
What is Nissen’s fundoplication?,"'A\xa0Nissen ''fundoplication'' is a\xa0surgical procedure\xa0that treats\xa0''gastroesophageal reflux disease''\xa0(''GERD''), commonly known as ''acid reflux'' disease or hiatus ''hernia''. The surgery is named after the surgeon who first performed it, Dr. Rudolph Nissen. It may be performed as an open surgery or minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, which would be decided by the surgeon based on his/her experience and extent of disease.\xa0''Gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''): The lower esophageal sphincter is a circular band of muscle around the lower part of the ''esophagus'' at the junction of the stomach. It relaxes to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach, after which it contracts to prevent backflow.\xa0''If the sphincter dysfunctions cause weakening or abnormal relaxation, it causes the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. This is called GERD. ''Surgery for GERD'' is required only if there is no improvement despite medical treatment, lifestyle, and ''diet'' modification.\xa0''Hiatus hernia: Hiatus hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach bulges through the ''diaphragm'' (a large, thin sheet of muscle separating the abdomen and chest). The diaphragm has a small opening (hiatus) through which the esophagus (food pipe) passes and opens into the stomach. In hiatus hernia, the stomach rolls through the opening and into the chest.''A small hernia is usually asymptomatic. But a large hernia tends to allow food and acid to back up into the esophagus, leading to acid reflux. Many of the times, these symptoms can be managed conservatively with medication, ''diet'', and lifestyle modifications. But a very large hernia would' "
Is Nissen’s fundoplication surgery required?,"'Surgery is required if conservative management fails and the patient has no symptomatic relief. This is because the constant backwash of acid irritates the lining of your esophagus, leading to inflammation, scarring, or even ''malignancy''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a hiatus hernia?,"'The clinical features of a hiatus hernia are very similar to that of GERD. The common signs and symptoms are:' Heartburn Regurgitation (backflow) of food or liquids into the mouth Acid reflux (backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus)  Halitosis (bad breath) Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Chest or abdominal pain or discomfort  Difficulty breathing Internal gastric bleeding, leading to vomiting of blood or passing of black stools"
How is Nissen’s fundoplication surgery done?,"'The patient first undergoes pre-operative assessment, and laboratory and radiological tests advised by the surgeon. The surgery is performed under anesthesia, either as an open surgery or minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.\xa0''During the surgery, the upper part of the stomach called the gastric fundus\xa0is wrapped around (plication) the entire lower end of the esophagus\xa0(360 degrees) and sutured (stitched).\xa0''The hiatus through which the hernia occurs is also narrowed by suturing to prevent or treat the hernia. Hence, when the stomach contracts, it also closes the esophagus, preventing the reflux of stomach acids and food contents back into the esophagus. The surgery may take around three hours, after which a patient may take a few more hours to recover from anesthesia.\xa0' "
What happens after Nissen’s fundoplication?,"'The patient is usually discharged two to three days after surgery.' In the hospital, painkillers, antibiotics, and antacids are administered. Nutritional therapy would be provided through a feeding tube or intravenously.  Patients may experience pain, swelling, and bruising, which usually resolves.  The esophagus and stomach would take two to three weeks to heal, during which patients would have to follow a soft solid or liquid diet suggested by the surgeon.  Patients may be prescribed antacids and nutritional supplements to continue after surgery for a few weeks.  Vigorous exercises, sports, and lifting heavy objects should be avoided for about six weeks after surgery."
What are the complications of Nissen’s fundoplication surgery?,"'The surgery is relatively safe with morbidity of less than 1%. Like any major surgery, fundoplication also has a risk for complications that are usually treatable or transient. Some common complications are:' Bleeding  Infection Nausea and vomiting Hematoma (blood clot) Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Bloating Dumping syndrome (when food moves too quickly from the stomach to the intestine) Scarring  Damage to surrounding nerves like vagus nerve  Scarring  Transient irritable bowel syndrome  Recurrence of hiatus hernia or GERD"
What are thyroid nodules?,"'The term ""thyroid nodule"" refers to any abnormal growth that forms a lump in the thyroid gland.'""The thyroid gland is located low in the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The gland is shaped like a butterfly and wraps around the windpipe or trachea. The two wings or lobes on either side of the windpipe are joined together by a ""'bridge'' of tissue, called the isthmus, which crosses over the front of the windpipe.''A thyroid nodule can occur in any part of the gland. Some nodules can be felt quite easily. Others can be hidden deep in the thyroid tissue or located very low in the gland, where they are difficult to feel.' "
What is a goiter?,"'A goiter is simply an enlarged thyroid gland. Multiple conditions can lead to goiter, including ''hypothyroidism'', ''hyperthyroidism'', excessive ''iodine'' intake, or thyroid tumors. Goiter is a non-specific finding that warrants medical evaluation.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of thyroid nodules?,"'The vast majority of thyroid nodules do not cause symptoms. However, if the cells in the nodules are functioning and producing thyroid hormone on their own, the nodule may produce signs and symptoms of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). A small number of patients complain of ''pain'' at the site of the nodule that can travel to the ear or jaw. If the nodule is very large, it can cause ''difficulty swallowing'' or shortness of breath by compressing the esophagus (tube connecting the mouth to the stomach) or trachea (windpipe). In rare instances, a patient may complain of ''hoarseness'' or difficulty speaking because of compression of the larynx (voice box).'  "
What causes thyroid nodules? What are the different types?,"'Thyroid nodules may be single or multiple.''The cause of most thyroid nodules is unknown. In certain cases, insufficient iodine in the ''diet'' can cause the thyroid to develop nodules, but this is no longer common in the U.S. Certain genes may contribute to development of thyroid nodules.'   A thyroid gland that contains multiple nodules is referred to as a multinodular goiter. If the nodule is filled with fluid or blood, it is called a thyroid cyst. If the nodule produces thyroid hormone in an uncontrolled manner (without regarding the body's needs), the nodule is referred to as autonomous. Such a nodule may cause signs and symptoms of too much thyroid hormone, or hyperthyroidism. Less often, patients with a thyroid nodule may have too little thyroid hormone, or hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is most common in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a condition characterized by painless autoimmune destruction of the thyroid. The most common types of single thyroid nodules are noncancerous colloid nodules or follicular adenomas. Another type of benign nodule that may be seen is called a Hurthle cell adenoma. Up to 24% of Hurthle cell nodules are cancerous. Few nodules are cancerous. Cancerous nodules are classified by the types of malignant thyroid cells they contain. These cell types include papillary, follicular, medullary, or poorly differentiated (anaplastic) cells. The prognosis for the patient depends largely on the cell type and how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis. In addition to thyroid cancer of the cell types mentioned previously, thyroid nodules may contain lymphoma (a cancer of the cells of the immune system). Cancer from other sites, such as breast and kidney, can also spread (metastasize) to the thyroid."
Can thyroid nodules be cancer?,"'Modern imaging techniques - such as ''ultrasound'' (US), ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') - have revealed more thyroid nodules incidentally This means that nodules are being found during studies that were done for reasons other than examination of the thyroid per se. Up to 4% to 8% of adult women and 1% to 2% of adult men have thyroid nodules detectable by physical examination. Closer to 30% of adult women have nodules detectable by ultrasound. In fact, diagnosis of a thyroid nodule is the most common endocrine problem in the United States.''Although the majority of thyroid nodules are benign (not cancerous), about 10% of nodules do contain cancer. Therefore, the primary purpose for evaluating a thyroid nodule is to determine whether cancer is present.' "
What tests diagnose thyroid nodules?,"'Thyroid nodules usually are discovered by the health care professional during routine physical examination of the neck. Occasionally, a patient may notice a nodule as a small lump in their neck when looking in the mirror. Once a nodule is discovered, a physician will carefully evaluate the nodule.''History:'' The doctor will take a detailed history, evaluating both past and present medical problems. If the patient is younger than 20 or older than 70 years, there is increased likelihood that a nodule is cancerous. Similarly, the nodule is more likely to be cancerous if there is any history of radiation exposure, difficulty swallowing, or a change in the voice. It was actually customary to apply radiation to the head and neck in the 1950s to treat ''acne''! Significant radiation exposures include the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. Although women tend to have more thyroid nodules than men, the nodules found in men are more likely to be cancerous. Despite its value, the history cannot differentiate benign from malignant nodules. Thus, many patients with risk factors uncovered in the history will have benign lesions. Others without risk factors for malignant nodules may still have thyroid cancer.''Physical examination:'' The physician should determine if there is one nodule or many nodules, and what the remainder of the gland feels like. The probability of cancer is higher if the nodule is fixed to the surrounding tissue (unmovable). In addition, the physical exam should search for any abnormal ''lymph nodes'' nearby that may suggest the spread of cancer. In addition to evaluating the thyroid, the physician should identify any signs of gland malfunction, such as thyroid hormone overproduction (hyperthyroidism) or underproduction (hypothyroidism).''Blood tests:'' Initially, blood tests should be done to assess thyroid function. These tests include:''Ultrasonography:'' A physician may order an ultrasound examination of the thyroid to:''Despite its value, the ultrasound cannot determine whether a nodule is benign or cancerous.''Radionuclide scanning:'' Radionuclide scanning with radioactive chemicals is another imaging technique a physician may use to evaluate a thyroid nodule. The normal thyroid gland accumulates iodine from the blood and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Thus, when radioactive iodine (123-iodine) is administered orally or intravenously to an individual, it accumulates in the thyroid and causes the gland to ""light up"" when imaged by a nuclear camera (a type of Geiger counter). The rate of accumulation gives an indication of how the thyroid gland and any nodules are functioning. A ""hot spot"" appears if a part of the gland or a nodule is producing too much hormone. Non-functioning or hypo-functioning nodules appear as ""''cold'' spots"" on scanning. A cold or non-functioning nodule carries a higher risk of cancer than a normal or hyper-functioning nodule. Cancerous nodules are more likely to be cold, because cancer cells are immature and don\'t accumulate the iodine as well as normal thyroid tissue. However, cold spots can also be caused by ''cysts''. This makes the ultrasound a much better tool for determining the need to do an FNA.''Fine needle aspiration:'' Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a nodule is a type of biopsy and the most common, direct way to determine what types of cells are present. The needle used is very thin. The procedure is simple and can be done in an outpatient office, and anesthetic is injected into tissues traversed by the needle. FNA is possible if the nodule is easily felt. If the nodule is more difficult to feel, fine needle aspiration can be performed with ultrasound guidance. The needle is inserted into the thyroid or nodule to withdraw cells. Usually, several samples are taken to maximize the chance of detecting abnormal cells. These cells are examined microscopically by a pathologist to determine if cancer cells are present. The value of FNA depends upon the experience of the physician performing the FNA and the pathologist reading the specimen. Diagnoses that can be made from FNA include:''One of the most difficult problems for the pathologist is to be confident that a follicular adenoma - usually a benign nodule - is not a follicular cell ''carcinoma'"" or cancer. In these cases, it is up to the physician and the patient to weigh the option of surgery on a case-by-case basis, with less reliance on the pathologist's interpretation of the biopsy. It is also important to remember that there is a small risk (3%) that a benign nodule diagnosed by FNA may still be cancerous. Thus, even benign nodules should be followed closely by the patient and physician. Another biopsy may be necessary, especially if the nodule is growing. Most thyroid cancers are not very aggressive; that is, they do not spread rapidly. The exception is poorly differentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma, which spreads rapidly and is difficult to treat.""   The free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Elevated levels of the thyroid hormones T4 or T3 in the context of suppressed TSH suggests hyperthyroidism Reduced T4 or T3 in the context of high TSH suggests hypothyroidism Antibody titers to thyroperoxidase or thyroglobulin may be useful to diagnose autoimmune thyroiditis (for example, Hashimoto's thyroiditis). If surgery is likely to be considered for treatment, it is strongly recommended that the physician als determine the level of thyroglobin. Produced only in the thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroglobulin carries thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroglobulin levels should fall quickly within 48 hours in the thyroid gland is completely remobed. If thyroglobulin levels start to climb. Detect nodules that are not easily felt Determine the number of nodules and their sizes Determine if a nodule is solid or cystic Assist obtaining tissue for diagnosis from the thyroid with a fine needle aspirate (FNA) Benign thyroid tissue (non-cancerous) can be consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a colloid nodule, or a thyroid cyst. This result is reported from approximately 60% of biopsies. Cancerous tissue (malignant) can be consistent with diagnosis of papillary, follicular, or medullary cancer. This result is reported from approximately 5% of biopsies. The majority of these are papillary cancers. Suspicious biopsy can show a follicular adenoma. Though usually benign, up to 20% of these nodules are found ultimately to be cancerous. Non-diagnostic results usually arise because insufficient cells were obtained. Upon repeat biopsy, up to 50% of these cases can be distinguished as benign, cancerous, or suspicious."
What is the treatment for thyroid nodules?,"'Follicular adenomas are difficult to distinguish from follicular cancers. Follicular nodules, other nodules highly suspicious for cancer and definite cancer should be treated by surgery. Most thyroid cancers are curable and rarely cause life-threatening problems. Any nodule not removed needs to be watched closely by follow-up with the physician every 6 to 12 months. This follow-up may involve a physical examination, ultrasound examination, or both. Occasionally, a physician may attempt to shrink the nodule by using suppressive doses of thyroid hormone. Some physicians believe that if a nodule shrinks on suppressive therapy, it is more likely to be benign. Recent large studies have shown that treating with thyroid suppression does not make a difference.''If a nodule causes hyperthyroidism, it is usually noncancerous. Treatment is aimed at preventing the signs, symptoms, and complications of hyperthyroidism, such as ''heart failure'', ''osteoporosis'',, and rapid ''heart'' rate. Treatments include destroying the gland using radioactive iodine (131-iodine), blocking production of thyroid hormone with medications, or conservatively following the patient with mild hyperthyroidism. ""Subclinical hyperthyroidism"" refers to an adult patient with a hyperfunctioning nodule, but TSH is minimally suppressed and the blood levels of thyroid hormones are normal. Treatment is individualized based on age, presence of other medical conditions, and patient preference.'  "
What is the importance of noise-induced hearing loss?,"'The industrial and technological revolution may have propelled society to higher levels of achievement, but this progress has also made the world a noisier place in which to live. In fact, noise pollution is a growing health hazard and can be found almost everywhere. Car alarms, leaf blowers, gunshots, boom boxes, and traffic ''congestion'' fill our cities with decibels (the measure of sound intensity). Escaping to the country may not provide a quiet refuge, and even farmers are at high risk for exposure to noise from their farm machinery.''Unpleasant or unwanted sounds are not the only harmful noises to which we may be exposed. For example, the music at a concert and the pounding of a jackhammer on the street can be equally damaging to the inner ear. Loud sounds (acoustic energies) delivered with equal intensity or over extended periods of time, regardless of their source, are equally dangerous. Eventually, continued or repeated exposures to high intensity sound can cause acoustic ''trauma'' to the ear. This trauma can result in ''hearing loss'', ''ringing in the ears'' (''tinnitus''), and occasional ''dizziness'' (''vertigo''), as well as non-auditory effects, such as increases in ''heart'' rate and ''blood pressure''.''One-third of the 30 million Americans with ''hearing loss'"" have an impairment that is at least partially attributed to excessive noise exposure. Noise remains the most common preventable cause of irreversible sensorineural (involving the ear's sensory nerve) ""'hearing'' loss.' "
What are acoustic trauma and noise-induced hearing loss?,"'Acoustic trauma occurs when any excessive sound energy strikes the inner ear. If it is brief, the noise may cause a reversible, temporary hearing loss, technically known as a temporary threshold shift. For example, after a loud rock concert, it is common to experience hearing dullness and ''ringing in the ears'' for several hours. In this situation, if symptoms persist beyond several days, oral steroids (cortisone-type medications) may help the inner ear to recover. If the noise is loud enough and the duration of exposure long enough, however, it may cause a permanent threshold shift. This condition is called noise-induced hearing loss, which has no cure and is irreversible.''Sudden hearing loss produced by a sudden and very loud noise (blast injury) is called acute acoustic trauma. If the sound is loud enough, it can cause the eardrum to rupture or the person to have a complete loss of hearing. Sometimes, particularly if the sudden loss is total and occurs combined with ''dizziness'', immediate surgical exploration of the ear may be necessary. In this circumstance, the ear surgeon may need to locate and patch a hole (perilymphatic fistula) between the inner ear fluid space and the middle ear space.'  "
How can a person tell if a noisy situation is dangerous to their hearing?,"'People may differ in their sensitivity to noise. Nevertheless, as a general rule, noise is probably damaging to the hearing if the noise:''In contrast to popular belief, there is no truth to the idea that a person is able to ""toughen up"" the ears by frequent exposure to loud noise. In reality, cumulative noise in the past has probably ''damaged'"" the ears to such a degree that a person doesn't hear the noise as much. Unfortunately, limited treatment is available for noise-induced hearing loss once the damage has occurred."" makes it necessary to shout to be heard over the background noise, causes ear pain, makes the ears ring, or causes a loss of hearing for several hours or more after exposure to the noise."
How loud can a sound get before it affects hearing?,"'Many experts agree that continual exposure to more than 85 decibels (dB) is dangerous to the ears. As already mentioned, the decibel is a measure of the intensity of sound. For example:''Decibels are measured logarithmically, which means that the sound energy of noise increases by units of 10. Therefore, a dB increase of a sound from 20to 30 dB is an increase of 10 times, and a dB increase of a sound from 20 to 40 dB corresponds to increase of 100 times (10 times 10).' the faintest sound the human ear can detect is labeled 0 dB, whereas the noise at a rocket pad during launch approaches 180 dB; a quiet whisper is approximately 30 dB;  normal conversation is 60 dB;  a lawnmower is 90 dB; and the sound from an iPod Shuffle has been measured at 115 dBs."
Do the duration and closeness of exposure to loud noise relate to hearing damage?,"'There is a direct correlation between the duration of exposure to a loud noise and the damage to hearing. This means that the longer the exposure, the greater the damage. Furthermore, the closer one is to the source of the intense noise, the more damaging it is. An example of this is ''iPod hearing loss.'' There is an alarming increase in hearing loss in children and young adults due to listening to loud music through earplugs so close to the eardrum.''Another example is discharging firearms. The loud blast of a gun so close to the ear can cause problems for anyone not wearing ear protection.' "
"What factors increase a person's susceptibility to noise-induced 
hearing loss?","'The following factors have been associated with an increased susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss:' blue eyes, light skin, family history of hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, Meniere disease, iron deficiency,  vitamin A deficiency, older age, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and smoking tobacco."
How else can noise affect a person?,"'After exposure to noise, ''tinnitus'', which is a ringing or another sound in the ears, occurs commonly. The tinnitus is a sign that inner ear damage or nerve destruction has occurred. Initially the tinnitus is temporary, lasting only several hours. As more cumulative exposure and damage occur, the tinnitus will last longer until it eventually becomes permanent. Loud noise will also cause some people to have ''anxiety'' and irritability, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, or an increase in stomach acid. In addition, very loud noise can reduce efficiency in performing difficult tasks by diverting attention from the job.' "
What are the regulations regarding on-the-job exposure to noise?,"'Habitual exposure to noise above 85dB will cause a gradual hearing loss in a significant number of individuals. Moreover, noise greater than 85dB will accelerate this damage. Accordingly, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has imposed regulations nationwide regarding on-the-job exposure to noise. For unprotected ears, the allowed exposure time decreases by one-half for each 5 dB increase in the average noise level. For instance, exposure is limited to 8 hours at 90 dB, 4 hr at 95 dB, and 2 hr at 100 dB. The highest permissible noise exposure for the unprotected ear is 115 dB for 15 minutes per day. ''Any'' noise above 140 dB is not permitted.''OSHA, in its Hearing Conservation Amendment of 1983, required the institution of a hearing conservation program in noisy workplaces. Such a program must include a yearly hearing test for workers exposed to an average of 85 dB or more of noise during their 8-hour workday. It turns out that approximately 25% of the American industrial workforce is exposed to this level of noise.'""Ideally, noisy machinery and work places should be designed to be quieter, and/or the workers' time in the noise should be reduced. The cost of reducing noise exposure in these ways, however, is often prohibitive. As an alternative, individual hearing protectors are required when noise averages more than 90 dB during an 8-hour day.""'When noise measurements indicate that hearing protectors are needed, the employer must offer at least one type of earplug and one type of earmuff without cost to employees. If the yearly hearing test reveals a hearing loss of 10 dB or more in the higher sound frequencies (pitch) in either ear, the worker must be informed. (The higher frequencies of sound are the most sensitive to noise damage.) Also, the worker must wear hearing protectors when noise averages more then 85 dB for an 8-hour day. Greater losses of hearing or the possibility of ear disease necessitates referral to an ear doctor (otolaryngologist).' "
How effective are hearing protection devices?,"'Hearing protection devices decrease the intensity of sound that reaches the eardrum. They come in two forms: earplugs and earmuffs.''Earplugs:'' Earplugs are small inserts that fit into the ''outer ear'' canal. To be effective they must totally block the ear canal with an air-tight seal. They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit individual ear canals and can be custom made. For people who have trouble keeping them in their ears, they can be fitted to a headband.''Earmuffs:'' Earmuffs fit over the entire outer ear to form an air seal. They are held in place by an adjustable band. Earmuffs must be snugly sealed so the entire circumference of the ear canal is blocked.''Properly fitted earplugs or muffs reduce noise by 15 to 30 dB of sound. The better earplugs and earmuffs are approximately equally effective in sound reduction. However, earplugs are better protection against low frequency noise(such as noise from a jackhammer), and earmuffs are better protection against high frequency noise (such as noise from an airplane taking off). For high frequency sounds, think of the high-pitched treble keys of the piano, whereas for low frequency sounds, think of the low- or deep-pitched bass keys of the piano.''Simultaneous use of earplugs and muffs usually adds 10 to 15 dB more protection than either used alone. Combined use should be considered when the noise exceeds 105 dB. It is important to understand that ordinary cotton balls or tissue paper wads stuffed into the ear canals are very poor protectors since they only reduce noise by approximately 7 dB.''Excessive noise exposure may occur at live rock concerts as well as in more intimate venues for music whenever amplification is utilized. The damage to hearing from music is every bit as permanent as that incurred by other means. As a matter of fact, special high-fidelity earplugs have been developed specifically for such situations and are being utilized by musicians and professional sound engineers. These earplugs are specially designed to eliminate the so-called ''plugged (occluded) ear effect'"" and to maintain an even reduction of sound across the frequency range. Otherwise, when the ear is plugged, the plugged ear effect makes one's voice sound more bass, or deeper, and louder. Try it by occluding your ear(s) (gently) with your finger, and speak. You'll hear the plugged ear effect."" "
What are the common problems with hearing protectors?,"'Studies have shown that one-half of the workers wearing hearing protectors receive only one-half or less of the noise reduction potential of their protectors. This diminished protection occurs because these devices either are not worn continuously while exposed to noise or they do not fit properly.''As previously mentioned, a hearing protector can give an average of 30 dB noise reduction if worn continuously during an 8-hour workday. If taken off for just one hour while exposed to noise, however, such a protector would provide only an average of 9 dB of protection during the 8 hours. This substantial reduction in protection occurs because with the logarithmic scale used to measure decibels, a 10-times increase in noise energy occurs for each 10 dB increase in sound. Thus, during the hour with unprotected ears, the worker is exposed to 1,000 times more sound energy than if earplugs or muffs had been worn. (For the 30 dB, 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 times more noise.)''In addition, noise exposure is cumulative. So, the noise at home or at play must be counted in the total exposure during any one day. A maximum allowable on-the-job exposure followed by further exposure at home to a noisy lawnmower or loud music will definitely exceed the safe daily limit.'""Even if earplugs and/or earmuffs are worn continuously while exposed to noise, they do little good if there is an incomplete air seal between the hearing protector and the skin. As mentioned above, when using ordinary hearing protectors, it is common to hear one's voice as louder and deeper. This plugged ear effect can actually be taken as a useful sign that the hearing protectors are properly positioned."" "
Do hearing protectors prevent a person from communicating with others?,"'The answer is no, at least for people with normal hearing. In fact, just as ''sunglasses'' help vision in very bright light, hearing protectors enhance speech understanding in very noisy places. Even in a quiet setting, a normal-hearing person wearing hearing protectors should be able to understand a regular conversation.''Hearing protectors do slightly reduce the ability of those with damaged hearing or poor comprehension of language to understand normal conversation. Nevertheless, it is essential that persons with impaired hearing wear earplugs or earmuffs to prevent further inner ear damage from noise.'""It has been argued that hearing protectors might reduce a worker's ability to hear the noises that signify an improperly functioning machine. Most workers, however, readily adjust to the quieter sounds and can still detect such problems."" "
How is hearing loss identified?,"'Hearing loss usually develops over a period of several years. Since the hearing loss is painless and gradual, many people may not notice it. What someone may notice is tinnitus, which is a ringing or another sound in the ear. The tinnitus could be the result of long-term exposure to noise that has damaged the hearing nerve. A person may have trouble understanding what people are saying or may hear everyone as mumbling. Such hearing difficulties are especially apt to occur when one is trying to hear in a noisy place such as in crowd or at a party. These difficulties could be the beginning of high-frequency hearing loss.''A typical hearing test (audiogram) of a person with noise induced hearing loss will initially show only a high frequency loss at 4000 Hz. (Hertz or Hz is the measure of sound frequency or pitch. Four thousand Hz is high frequency, while 250 or 500 Hz would be low frequency). With continued noise exposure and hearing loss, the audiogram will show a broader loss to include lower (deeper)frequencies.''Noise-induced hearing loss will almost always affect both ears equally, but in some situations, especially with firearm usage, it may be worse in one ear than in the other. For example, firing a rifle tends to injure the ear opposite the side of the ''trigger finger'"" due to the shadow (blocking the sound) effect of the shooter's head.""  "
What can be done to treat hearing loss?,"'If a person has any of these symptoms that suggest hearing loss, he or she should consult a physician with special training in ear and hearing disorders(an otolaryngologist or otologist). This type of doctor can diagnose hearing problems and recommend the best way to manage them.''While there is no cure for noise-induced hearing loss, there is some promising research being done. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) is looking at the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing loss and restore hearing. NIDCD-funded researchers have shown that ''aspirin'' and ''vitamin E'' can reduce hearing loss if used before exposure to loud noise.''Researchers at the University of Michigan used ''vitamins''  A, C, E and magnesium prior to loud noise exposure to prevent hearing loss in animal studies. Studies on people are in progress.''For examples of sounds measured in dBs, The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery provides an'' Interactive Loudness Scale''.'  "
What is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of ""'cancer'' that originates in the cells of the lymphatic and immune systems, such as the blood cells known as lymphocytes and the ''lymph node'"" tissues. NHL is the sixth most common cancer in the United States. Another type of lymphatic cancer is Hodgkin's disease, which is a type of lymphoma (cancer of the ""'lymph nodes'""). NHL represents a group of different cancers that are different from Hodgkin's disease (see below).""""The lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system and helps fight infections and other diseases. In addition, the lymphatic system filters out bacteria, ""'viruses'', and other unwanted substances.''The lymphatic system consists of the following:''Lymph vessels'': These vessels branch out throughout the body similar to blood vessels.'""Because lymphatic tissue is found in many parts of the body, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can start almost anywhere.""   Lymph: The lymph vessels carry a clear fluid called lymph. Lymph contains white blood cells including a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes (such as B cells and T cells). Lymph nodes: Lymph vessels connect to small masses of lymph tissue called lymph nodes (small bean-shaped structures). Collections of lymph nodes are in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymph nodes store white blood cells. When you are ill and the lymph nodes are active, they will swell and be easily palpable (a doctor can feel them during an examination). Additional parts of the lymphatic system: The tonsils, thymus, and spleen are additional components of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic tissue is also in other parts of the body, including the stomach, skin, and small intestine."
What is the difference between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease (or Hodgkin's lymphoma)?,"'Both of these cancers are lymphomas, a cancer that begins in lymphocytes. The main difference is which subset of lymphocytes are involved. Doctors can establish this by looking at the cells under a microscope as well as with additional tests to characterize the ''tumor'"" cells. Distinguishing the type of lymphoma is important because treatment, disease course, and prognosis can be quite different. A microscopic examination can help to distinguish between the two lymphomas. The presence of characteristic cells called Reed-Sternberg cells would indicate a Hodgkin's lymphoma."" "
What causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""We don't know what causes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL occurs when the body produces too many abnormal lymphocytes. In the normal life cycle of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), old lymphocytes die and the body creates new ones to replenish the supply. In NHL, lymphocytes grow indefinitely, so the number of circulating lymphocytes increases, filling up the lymph nodes and causing them to swell.""""Some diseases or syndromes can increase a person's risk for lymphomas (for example, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). In NHL, either B cells or T cells are involved in this process. These are the two subtypes of lymphocytes. B cells produce antibodies that fight infections. This is the most common type of cell involved in the NHL (B-cell lymphomas). T cells kill foreign substances directly. NHL less frequently originates from T cells. A low-grade NHL is an indolent form of the disease that progresses very slowly, while high-grade NHL is more likely to grow quickly (sometimes also referred to as ""'aggressive lymphoma'').''The following are some of the subtypes of NHL:'""Burkitt's lymphoma""': This lymphoma has two major subtypes: an African type closely associated with an infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' and the non-African, or sporadic, form that is not linked to the virus.''Cutaneous lymphoma'': This form of lymphoma involves the skin and can be classified as T-cell lymphoma or (less commonly) B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma makes up 4% of NHL cases.''Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma'': This represents the most common lymphoma (approximately 30% of NHL) and can be rapidly fatal if not treated.''Follicular lymphoma'': These lymphomas exhibit a specific growth pattern when viewed under the microscope (follicular or nodular pattern); they are usually advanced at the time of diagnosis.''Lymphoblastic lymphoma'': This is a rare form of lymphoma that accounts for about 2% of cases of NHL.''MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma'': This is a B-cell lymphoma that usually affects individuals in their 60s. The most common area for this lymphoma to develop is the stomach.''Mantle cell lymphoma'': One of the rarest of the NHL, mantle cell lymphoma accounts for about 6% of cases. This NHL is difficult to treat and is a subtype of B-cell lymphoma.''Adult T-cell lymphoma/''leukemia'"": This is a rare but aggressive NHL of the immune system's T cells. Human T-cell ""'leukemia''/lymphotropic virus type (HTLV-1) is the cause of this form of T-cell lymphoma.'""Waldenström's macroglobulinemia""': This is a rare and slow-growing form of NHL.''Anaplastic large cell lymphoma'': This is a rare type of NHL and a subtype of T-cell lymphoma.' "
What are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma risk factors?,"""In many cases, people who develop NHL have no risk factors, and doctors seldom know why one person develops non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and another does not.""'Certain risk factors increase the chance that a person will develop this disease although most people who have these risk factors will never develop the disease.'""Medications that suppress the immune system: Using immunosuppressive agents (such as after an organ transplant) is a risk factor as it reduces the body's ability to fight infection.""'Weakened immune system: Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of developing lymphoma.''Certain infections: Certain viral and ''bacterial infections'' increase the risk of NHL. Examples are ''HIV'', ''hepatitis C'' virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. A type of bacteria sometimes linked to NHL is the ulcer-causing bacteria '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'').''Certain diseases: Having particular autoimmune diseases and/or ''type 2 diabetes'"" increase one's risk of developing NHL. Note: Lymphoma is not ""'contagious'"". It's impossible to catch lymphoma from another person.""""Age: Although non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can occur in young people, the chance of developing this disease increases with age. Most people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are older than 60 years of age.""""Other possible links: People who work with herbicides or certain other chemicals may be at increased risk of this disease. Researchers are also looking at a possible link between using hair dyes before 1980 and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. None of these possible links have definitely been proven.""""Note: Having one or more risk factors does not mean that a person will develop non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Most people who have risk factors never develop cancer."" "
What are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of NHL include the following:'   Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin Unexplained weight loss Fever Anemia (low red blood cell counts) Night sweats Coughing, trouble breathing, or chest pain Weakness and tiredness that don't go away (fatigue) Abdominal pain or swelling, or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen Loss of appetite Itching of the skin"
What kind of doctors treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,'Blood cancer specialists (hematologists/oncologists) are the physician specialists who treat lymphomas. They can be part of a larger health care team that coordinates your care.' 
How do physicians diagnose non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Physical exam'': A doctor will complete a physical examination with a special emphasis on palpating the lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, and groin and establishing if they are swollen. He or she will also try to find out if there is swelling in the spleen or ''liver''. In most cases, ''swollen lymph nodes'' are signs of infection (rather than lymphoma), and a doctor will try to establish if there are any other signs of infection and what the source of the infection could be.''Medical history'"": A doctor will ask questions concerning one's past medical history and about risk factors for NHL.""'Blood tests'': Doctors perform a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') to check the number of white blood cells. Additional tests might include a lactate dehydrogenase level (can be elevated in lymphoma). A physician may perform additional tests to rule out an infection causing the swollen lymph nodes.''Imaging procedures'': A ''chest X-ray'' or ''CT scan'' of the chest or neck might help detect the presence of tumors or more ''enlarged lymph nodes''. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a newer modality to help detect NHL.''Biopsy'': A doctor might recommend a biopsy of lymph nodes to diagnose the cause of the swelling. A pathologist will review the samples under the microscope and establish a diagnosis.''There are three ways to diagnose a lymph node: removal of the entire lymph node (excisional biopsy); partial removal of a lymph node (incisional biopsy); fine-needle aspiration (using a thin needle to remove some lymph node tissue) is often not diagnostic as not enough tissue is removed for the pathologist to make a diagnosis.''Bone marrow biopsy'': A bone marrow biopsy can establish the spread of the disease. This involves the insertion of a needle into bone to obtain bone marrow. In adults, the most common site for this biopsy is the pelvic bone.' "
"What are the types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and how is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma staging determined?","'There are many different types of NHL classifications. Several classification systems exist for NHL, including the Revised European American Lymphoma Classification, which is the foundation for the WHO lymphoma classification. The classifications use cell types and defining other characteristics. There are three large groups: the B cell, T cell, and natural killer cell tumors.''Newer techniques such as immunophenotyping (a way to study the proteins on a cell and identify the precise types of B or T cells that are involved) diagnose and classify lymphomas. This technique is especially useful in the case of B-cell lymphomas.''Testing of DNA from the lymphoma detects gene defects that help determine the prognosis and response to treatment.''To plan the best treatment for NHL, a health care provider needs to stage (know the extent of) the disease. This is an attempt to find out what part of the body is involved.''Different tests are involved in the staging process, and they can include the following:''Doctors will also stage the lymphoma based on spread of the disease and organ involvement as well as symptoms:' Bone marrow biopsy (see above) CT scan MRI Ultrasound PET scan: A health care professional injects radioactive material, and a CT scan is performed to determine the metabolism of this material. Lymphoma cells show faster metabolism than normal cells, and areas with lymphoma look brighter on the pictures. Stage I: The cells are found in only one lymph node area (such as in the neck or axilla). Or, if the abnormal cells are not in the lymph nodes, they are in only one part of a tissue or organ (such as the lung, but not the liver or bone marrow). Stage II: A physician finds lymphoma cells in at least two lymph node areas on the same side of the body or only above or below the diaphragm. Or the cells are in one organ and the lymph nodes affected are near that organ. Stage III: The lymphoma is in lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm. The lymphoma may spread into an organ near this lymph node group. Stage IV: In addition to lymph cell spread, doctors find lymphoma cells in several parts of one or more organs or tissues. A: No symptoms (The individual has not had weight loss, fever, or night sweats.) B: Presence of any of the following symptoms: weight loss (10% or more in the last six months), fever (greater than 101.5 F) night sweats, or severe itching"
What is the treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'A doctor will usually refer a patient to an oncologist for evaluation and treatment. Some large academic medical centers have oncologists who specialize in lymphomas.''The treatment plan depends mainly on the following:'""If one has a slow-growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without symptoms, one may not require treatment for the cancer right away. A health care team closely watches the individual. These cancers might not require treatment for years, although close follow-up is necessary. If the ""'indolent lymphoma'' produces symptoms, therapy will usually consist of chemotherapy and biological therapy. Stage I and II often require ''radiation'' therapy.''A combination of chemotherapy, biological therapy, and sometimes radiation therapy may be necessary for an aggressive type of lymphoma.''If treatment is required, there are several options used alone or in combination:''Chemotherapy'': Health care professionals administer this drug treatment either as an injection or oral form that kills cancer cells. This treatment can involve one medication or multiple medications, and health care professionals may give it alone or in conjunction with other therapies. This therapy is given in cycles, alternating treatment periods and non-treatment periods. The repetition of these cycles and the number of cycles will be determined by an oncologist based on the staging of the cancer and the medications used. Chemotherapy also harms normal cells that divide rapidly. This can lead to ''hair loss'', GI symptoms, and difficulty with the immune system.''Radiation therapy'': High doses of radiation kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Health care professionals use this modality alone or in conjunction with other therapies. Side effects usually depend on the type and dosage of the therapy as well as the area undergoing radiation therapy. Universally, patients tend to get tired during radiation therapy, especially toward the later stages of treatment.''Stem cell transplant'': This procedure allows a patient to receive large doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill the lymphoma cells that might survive standard levels of therapy. Physicians use this therapy if the lymphoma returns after treatment. For this therapy, one needs to be admitted to the hospital. After the therapy, a doctor injects healthy ''stem cells'' (that were either taken from you before the therapy or from a donor) to form a new immune system.''Biological ''drugs'"": These medications enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancers. Monoclonal antibodies treat NHL. Health care professionals administer the therapy via an IV, and the monoclonal antibodies bind to the cancer cells and augment the immune system's ability to destroy cancer cells. ""'Rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') is such a drug used in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Side effects for this treatment are usually ''flu-like symptoms''. Rarely, a person can have a severe reaction, including a drop in ''blood pressure'' or difficulty breathing. R-CHOP therapy or regimen is an example of a common regimen used to treat NHL. It involves a combination of chemotherapy and biological therapy drugs (rituximab; ''cyclophosphamide''; doxorubicin hydrochloride; vincristine sulfate) and ''prednisone''.''Radio immunotherapy medications'': These are made of monoclonal antibodies that transport radioactive materials directly to cancer cells. Because the radioactive material is traveling and binding directly to the cancer cell, the cancer cell absorbs more radiation. Ibritumomab (''Zevalin'') and tositumomab (Bexxar) are two drugs approved for this use in lymphomas. Side effects usually include getting very tired or experiencing ''flu-like'' symptoms.''In addition to medical therapies, patients will also require supportive care. One should have the opportunity to learn about the disease and the treatment options and discuss this with a care team. Most cancer centers will have support groups where one can share concerns with other patients and learn from their experiences.''Some patients find moderate physical activity helpful. Discuss with a doctor what kind of activities are appropriate.''Eating the appropriate amounts of foods, as well as the right foods, is an important part of treatment. Speaking with a nutritionist can be very helpful.''In addition, researchers linked vitamin deficiencies (especially ''vitamin D'') to worse survival in some subgroups of cancer patients. Patients should discuss their nutritional requirements with their health care team.''Appropriate caloric intake is important especially if ''nausea'' is present due to your treatments. Some people find that ''exercise'' can help their ''nausea'' during therapy. ''Acupuncture'' has also shown to decrease the side effects of cancer treatments.'

What is the prognosis and survival rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'The prognosis of NHL can be good but depends on the type of lymphoma, the extent of spread (staging), and response to therapy. A health care provider will discuss the prognosis with the patient. The overall five-year survival rate for people with NHL is 71%, while the overall 10-year survival rate is 60%.''The National Cancer Institute reports the following average five-year survival by stage:'""Five-year survival is a measure used to predict and gauge the severity of the cancer. Patients should discuss risk factors, staging, and classifications with their health care team as none of these numbers apply to an individual patient without considering all the circumstances of the patient's illness.""

Is it possible to prevent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""Most people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have no identifiable risk factors. This makes it difficult to prevent the disease.""'Most known causes of lymphoma are difficult to avoid, such as medications that suppress the immune system, as they are usually life-saving medications needed for other reasons.' "
What is the latest research on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Research on NHL focuses on three aspects:' Early detection of the disease: This work is looking at DNA changes in lymphoma and how to test for these changes. Prevention: Studies are under way to examine what causes normal lymphocytes to develop into lymphoma cells and how to prevent this. Treatment: Better treatment modalities and protocols are always being tested. Chemotherapy: Newer drugs and protocols for administration are being studied in clinical trials at many different medical centers.

It is characterized by a typical rash resembling a bull’s eye.''Other viral infections'': These are ''adenovirus'', ''measles'', and ''rubella''.''Erythema marginatum'': It is seen as a pink, ring-like rash on the trunk and inner surfaces of the limbs. It is a skin manifestation of ''rheumatic fever''.''Rocky mountain spotted fever'': It is a rash caused by a bacterial infection that spreads by ticks. The rash appears first on the wrist and ankle preceded by ''fever and headache''.''Granuloma annulare'': It is characterized by red, small, raised, circular bumps arranged in a ring or circle distributed over the back of forearms or ''feet''.''Blisters'' (pemphigus vulgaris)'': It is a disease in which fluid-filled blisters are surrounded by rash, which is more prominently seen when the ''blister'' bursts. These blisters are distributed over the inner lining of the mouth and skin.''It is advisable to visit a board-certified dermatologist to ascertain the exact cause of the red spots, get treated, and avoid worsening of the skin condition.'

What is spondyloarthritis?,"'Spondyloarthritis is a family of inflammatory ''arthritis'' that includes ''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', juvenile spondyloarthropathy, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy, and arthritis and spondylitis related to ''inflammatory bowel disease'"" (Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''). This family of inflammatory arthritis can be thought of in two general groups: axial spondyloarthritis and peripheral spondyloarthritis. Peripheral spondyloarthritis affects mainly the peripheral joints (knees, ankles, shoulders, wrists, hands, and ''feet'') and the tendons of these joints.' "
What is axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)?,"'When spondyloarthritis mostly affects the spine, it is referred to as axial spondyloarthritis. In other words, it is a type of inflammatory arthritis that predominantly affects the spine. AxSpA can be severe and disabling. AxSpA is further split into two groups, ''ankylosing spondylitis'' (AS) and ''non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis'' (nr-axSpA). Usually patients with AS have abnormalities in the sacroiliac joints (spinal joints in the pelvis) on ''X-rays''. These sacroiliac joint abnormalities are part of many sets of diagnostic criteria for AS.' "
What is the definition of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)?,"'AS has many features in common with nr-axSpA, but patients with nr-axSpA do not have changes of inflammatory arthritis on routine X-rays of their sacroiliac joints or of the spine. So, patients with nr-axSpA may have similar symptoms and blood test results as patients with AS, but they do not have the same abnormalities on X-ray. It is not known at this time if AS and nr-axSpA are two different diseases or if nr-axSpA is an earlier or less severe form of AS. While patients with nr-axSpA do not have abnormalities in their sacroiliac joints seen on X-rays, they often have inflammation in the sacroiliac joints seen on ''MRI''.' "
"What are causes and risk factors for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
(nr-axSpA)?","'Risk factors for nr-axSpA include ''uveitis'', ''psoriasis'', and ''inflammatory bowel disease''. Carrying the HLA-B27 gene is one of the major risk factors for any type of spondyloarthropathy, including nr-axSpA. However, most people who have the HLA-B27 gene never develop any type of spondyloarthropathy. In fact, the prevalence of the HLA-B27 gene in the U.S. population is about 8%, but only up to 1% of the U.S. population is estimated to have any type of spondyloarthropathy. Typically, nr-axSpA  begins in young adults. The peak age of onset is between 20 and 30 years old, and the symptoms usually begin prior to age 40.' "
"What are non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) symptoms and 
signs?","'Inflammatory ''back pain'' is the main symptom of nr-axSpA. Inflammatory ''back pain'' causes ''stiffness'' that is worse in the morning and improves with activity and as the day progresses. Patients with inflammatory ''back pain'' may wake up in the second half of the night from the ''pain''. ''Pain'' and swelling in the peripheral joints may also occur, which most commonly affects four or fewer large joints (for example, an ankle and a knee, or a knee and an elbow). Studies have found that patients with nr-axSpA have impaired quality of life due to their symptoms. Symptoms and signs affecting other parts of the body also occur, including ''uveitis'' (inflammation of the eye causing a red, painful eye), arthritis of the peripheral joints (such as knees, ankles, and hands), and ''enthesitis'' (inflammation where the tendons insert into the bone). For example, a patient with nr-axSpA may have ''back pain'' and stiffness and also ''pain'' at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon attaches.' "
How do doctors diagnose non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)?,"'The diagnosis of nr-axSpA is a clinical diagnosis, meaning that no single blood test, X-ray, or ''MRI'' can diagnose nr-axSpA. Diagnosis is made by a physician with expertise in evaluating and treating inflammatory arthritis. ''Rheumatologists'' are specialists in diagnosing and treating various kinds of inflammatory arthritis, including nr-axSpA. The diagnosis is based on a history, physical exam, and a combination of laboratory and radiographic testing. Laboratory testing usually will include testing for the presence of the HLA-B27 gene, markers of inflammation such as ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP) and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR or sed rate). Radiographic testing may include plain X-rays and sometimes ''MRIs''.' "
What are treatment options for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)?,"'Treatment for nr-axSpA includes medications and non-medication treatments. The non-medication treatments are a healthy ''diet'', ''smoking cessation'', physical therapy, and ''exercise''. Medication treatments for nr-axSpA include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''), ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), and others, steroid injections into joints, and ''biologics''. Biologics that inhibit TNF (''tumor'' necrosis factor alpha) have been proven effective for ''ankylosing spondylitis''. These include ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), and ''certolizumab'' pegol (''Cimzia''). These medications often treat nr-axSpA. The TNF inhibitor certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) has been specifically studied in nr-axSpA and proven effective and is approved by the FDA for this indication. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is a biologic that inhibits the cytokine IL-17. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is FDA approved for ankylosing spondylitis and has been studied in nr-axSpA, as well.' "
What is the prognosis for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)?,"'There is no known cure for nr-axSpA. Some patients with nr-axSpA may progress to develop ankylosing spondylitis. However, nr-axSpA is a treatable condition, and many patients improve a great deal with treatment. Often the signs and symptoms can be stabilized, and patients can live a full and productive life.' "
Is it possible to prevent non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)?,"'There is no known way to prevent nr-axSpA. However, living a healthy lifestyle, including eating a healthy ''diet'', getting enough ''exercise'', and not ''smoking'' are important for everyone to maintain good general health.' "
What is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?,"'Non-small cell lung cancer'' (NSCLC) is composed of three types of ''cancers'' that originate from lung tissue. The three types are known as adenocarcinomas,\xa0squamous cell carcinomas, and\xa0large cell carcinomas.'   Adenocarcinomas are slow-growing cancers that usually first appear in the peripheral or outside areas of the lungs; it occurs more often in smokers, but it's the most common type of lung cancer in nonsmokers, too. Squamous cell carcinomas usually occur in the center of the lungs and often develops in smokers. While large cell carcinomas occur anywhere in the lung tissue and grow more rapidly than adenomas or squamous cell lung carcinomas. NSCLC types account for about 80%-85% of lung cancers."
What is small cell lung cancer (SCLC)?,"'Small cell lung cancer'' (SCLC) is different from NSCLC because it almost always begins in the bronchi, the airways in the center of the chest, and it is rarely seen in people who do not smoke.' "
SCLC vs. NSCLC similarities and differences," SCLC rapidly spreads (metastasizes) to other organs much faster than NSCLC types. Microscopically, SCLC are composed of much smaller cells. SCLC can be fatal in a few weeks if untreated, in contrast to most cases of NSCLC with metastases. SCLC counts for about 15%-20% of lung cancers. In addition, SCLC has only two stages (a system used by doctors to define the extent of spread of a cancer), while NSCLC is staged differently with another staging system (TNM, see staging below). NSCLC and SCLC are similar in that they both are lung cancers and they are diagnosed with most of the same tests (see diagnostic section below) and have essentially the same risk factors for development, most notably, smoking. In general, treatment methods (for example, chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation) are similar although different drugs may be used."
What are causes and risk factors for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?,"'The major cause of NSCLC and SCLC is ''tobacco smoking''; this cause and risk factor may account for as many as 90% of all lung cancers. For SCLC, about 98% of patients have a history of tobacco ''smoking''.\xa0Other factors that may play a role include' arsenic exposure, radiation exposure, and/or exposure to environmental carcinogens."
"Is it possible to have non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung 
cancer at the same time?","'Although it is relatively rare, it is possible to have a mix of small cell/non-small cell lung cancers in one individual.' "
"What are the signs and symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer and small 
cell lung cancer?","'The most common signs and symptoms that may occur with NSCLC and SCLC include''Although both NSCLC and SCLC can ''metastasize'' to other organs, SCLC can do it much more rapidly and patients develop symptoms of ''metastasis'' quicker than those with NSCLC. Some symptoms of ''metastasis'' are'  cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue, chest pain, weight loss and loss of appetite, recurring lung infections, hoarseness, coughing up blood, and swelling of the face or neck. bone pain, nervous system changes (for example, dizziness and seizures), jaundice, large lymph nodes, and/or other symptoms or syndromes such as SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone), Horner syndrome (eye changes on one side of the face), and others."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?,"'Both cancers utilize similar tests for detection.' After your doctor takes a medical history and physical exam, chest X-ray, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) may be utilized. In addition, sputum cytology, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, ultrasound, and biopsies of other tissues may be used to localize and/or identify the lung cancer type and stage."
What are the stages of non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?,"'NSCLC is staged differently than SCLC.''NSCLC utilizes the system termed TNM, in which''SCLC is staged into two categories;' T describes the size of the primary tumor, N describes the spread of the cancer to regional lymph nodes, and M indicates whether the cancer has metastasized. limited stage indicates SCLC is only located on one side of the chest and can be treated by radiation and chemotherapy and rarely, by surgery, while the other stage termed extensive stage means that SCLC has spread throughout the lung to the lymph nodes or has metastasized to other parts of the body. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of individuals with SCLC are first diagnosed in the extensive stage in which usually chemotherapy alone is the best treatment option."
What are treatments and medications for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?," Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and less frequently, surgery may be utilized to treat NSCLC or SCLC. Treatments and medication are individualized for each patient. You and your doctors (oncologist, pneumonologist, surgeon, radiologist, and other team members) need to discuss what options may be best for your individual problem."
What is the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?,"'Unfortunately, the prognosis for NSCLC and SCLC varies from fair to poor.''However, NSCLC has a better survival rate with a relative five-year survival rate, depending upon how advanced the disease is at diagnosis, of about''SCLC is usually diagnosed (two-thirds of SCLC patients) in the extensive stage.'  55% for localized disease, 27% for regional lymph node disease, and 4.2% for distant metastatic disease. For the third of patients with limited stage, appropriate treatment can lead to a five-year survival rate of about 12%-15%. For patients in the extensive stage, even with treatment, only about 2% are alive after five years."
Is it possible to prevent non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer?,"'It is possible to reduce the risk of getting either NSCLC or SCLC.' The best action to take is to never smoke tobacco. If you do smoke, quit now. Avoid secondhand tobacco smoke. Avoid exposure to potential carcinogens such as radon, toxic chemicals, and sources of radiation. Most health care professionals also suggest that you eat a diet containing lots of fruits and vegetables and further recommend daily exercise."
What are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?,"'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly prescribed medications for the inflammation of ''arthritis'' and other body tissues, such as in tendinitis and ''bursitis''. The also are used for minor aches and pains.''Examples of NSAIDs include:''NSAIDs are available by prescription or without a prescription (''over-the-counter''). They also are ingredients in many over the counter medications used for colds and minor aches and ''pain''. They are administered orally as capsules, tablets, liquids, or by injection (''ketorolac'' , ''Toradol''). Although not included in this review, NSAIDs also are used as eye drops for eye inflammation (for example, ''ketorolac tromethamine'' [''Acular'']).''NSAIDs are taken regularly by approximately 33 million Americans and over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs are consumed annually in the United States.'   aspirin, indomethacin (Indocin), ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn), piroxicam (Feldene), nabumetone (Relafen), and Celecoxib (Celebrex)."
What are the side effects of NSAIDs?,"'The major side effects of NSAIDs are related to their effects on the stomach and bowels (gastrointestinal system). Some 10% to 50% of patients are unable to tolerate treatment with NSAIDs because of side effects, including ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''upset stomach''. Approximately 15% of patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs develop a ''peptic ulcer'' (ulceration of the stomach or duodenum). Even though many of these patients with ulcers do not have symptoms and are unaware of their ulcers, they are at risk of developing serious ulcer complications, such as bleeding or perforation of the stomach.''The annual risk of serious complications is 1% to 4% with chronic treatment with NSAIDs. The risk of ulcers is higher in the elderly and individuals with ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and those also taking steroid-containing medications (for example, ''prednisone''), and individuals with a prior history of bleeding ulcers. Taking blood thinning medications (''anticoagulants''), such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), and ''heparin'', does not cause ''NSAID''-related ulcers, but rather they increase bleeding if NSAID-induced ulcers occur.''A prior history of ulcers is the most important predictor of NSAID-induced ulcers. Patients with ''heart disease'' who are taking aspirin for ''prevention'' of ''heart attacks'' also are at risk, and the risk of bleeding ulcers doubles if aspirin is combined with other NSAIDs.' "
How do NSAIDs work and how do they cause stomach problems?,"""Prostaglandins are natural chemicals that serve as messengers to promote inflammation. By inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandins, NSAIDs decrease inflammation and the symptoms and signs of inflammation, such as\xa0""'pain'', tenderness, and ''fever''. However, certain prostaglandins also are important in protecting the stomach lining from the corrosive effects of stomach acid, as well as playing a role in maintaining the natural, healthy condition of the stomach lining. These protective prostaglandins are produced by an enzyme called Cox-1. By blocking the Cox-1 enzyme and disrupting the production of prostaglandins in the stomach, NSAIDs can cause ulcers and bleeding. Some NSAIDs have less effect on prostaglandins in the stomach than others, and, therefore, may have a lower risk of causing ulcers, but the increased risk of ulcers still exists.' "
"If a stomach ulcer is detected, how is it treated?","'Treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers involves discontinuing the NSAID, reducing stomach acid with H2-blockers, for example, ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac''), ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''), ''famotidine'' (''Pepcid''), and ''nizatidine'' (''Axid'', Axid AR), or, more effectively, with ''proton pump inhibitors'', such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec'') or synthetic prostaglandins, specifically ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''). Since ''H. pylori'' bacteria is a common cause of ulcers, eradication of the bacteria with a combination of antibiotics also may promote ulcer healing.' "
Can NSAID-related ulcers and complications be prevented?,"""NSAIDs are valuable medications for patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. For patients who need long-term NSAID treatment, several steps can be taken to decrease NSAID-related ulcers and complications. The risk of ulcers and complications tends to be dose related. Therefore, the smallest effective dose of NSAIDs is taken to minimize the risk. NSAIDs might be selected that have less effect on the stomach's production of prostaglandins. Some of these NSAIDs are called selective ""'Cox-2 inhibitors''. ''Cox-2'' inhibitors block the Cox-2 enzyme that produces prostaglandins of inflammation without blocking the prostaglandin production of Cox-1 in the stomach. Currently in the United States, the only available selective ''Cox-2 inhibitor'' is celecoxib (Celebrex).''Taking NSAIDs with meals may minimize stomach upset with NSAIDs, but not ulcerations.''A synthetic prostaglandin, misoprostol (Cytotec), can be administered orally along with NSAIDs. Misoprostol has been shown to decrease NSAID-induced ulcers and their complications. The side effects of misoprostol include abdominal ''cramps'' and ''diarrhea''.

What are gallstones?,"'The\xa0''gallbladder'' is a small pear-shaped organ located below the ''liver'' on the right side of the abdomen. The main function of the gallbladder is to store bile, a substance secreted by the liver that is required for ''digestion''. Bile contents in the bile may sometimes crystallize and form ''gallstones.'' They may be as small as a grain of salt or as large as a tennis ball, causing serious complications.''The treatment of gallstones usually involves surgical removal of the gallbladder. If gallstones are not very large, the doctor may advise nonsurgical treatment methods to dissolve the gallstones. Nonsurgical treatment is typically done for ''cholesterol'' gallstones. The other type of gallstones, called pigment gallstones, usually need surgery.''There may be no symptoms in the initial stages. Some signs and symptoms that may develop later are as follows:' Pain in the right upper abdomen, which may be mild or severe  Back pain Digestive discomfort, especially after a heavy meal  Tenderness over the right upper abdomen  Fever with chills, in case of infection  Nausea and vomiting "
Do gallstones require treatment?,"'If there are no symptoms, observation and regular follow-up may be done. In the presence of symptoms, treatment for gallstones is necessary to relieve symptoms and to avoid serious complications. Surgery may be required if nonsurgical treatments are not possible and if there is a recurrence, with a high risk of complications.''Complications of gallstones may include:' Inflammation of the gallbladder: Gallstones can block the ducts inside the gallbladder or neck of the gallbladder, causing the gallbladder to become inflamed or infected. This is called cholecystitis. Cholecystitis can cause severe pain and fever. Blockage of the common bile duct: A gallstone may pass out of the gallbladder duct and into the main bile duct, leading to bile duct infection that can eventually cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). This causes severe pain, jaundice, and infection. Blockage of the pancreatic duct: The pancreatic duct is a tube that connects the pancreas to the common bile duct just before opening into the duodenum. The flow of pancreatic juices, which aid in digestion, gets blocked if the pancreatic duct is blocked by gallstones. This leads to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). It causes intense, constant abdominal pain and usually requires hospitalization. Gallbladder cancer: Although extremely rare, having a history of gallstones may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer."
What is nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease?,'The isolation and presence of nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (NTM) from the ''lungs'' does not necessarily indicate an active disease process that needs aggressive treatment. What is more important is to distinguish is a temporary colonization of NTM from true infection because true NTM infection can ultimately cause progressive lung disease.''The incidence and prevalence of no-tuberculosis mycobacterial lung disease has increased in recent years likely due to improved methods of diagnosis as well as increased awareness by healthcare professionals.' 
Where are nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)? Where are they found?,"'Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a collection of environmental bacteria found widespread throughout the environment, and typically are found in water (for example, marshlands, streams, rivers, and estuaries), soil, or dispersed in the air we breathe. Although related to other mycobacteria that can cause disease, these NTM specifically do not cause tuberculosis or ''leprosy''.''NTM can cause infections in the lungs, sinuses, ''lymph nodes'', joints, and central nervous system. NTM either can infiltrate and live in the lungs without causing symptoms, signs, or any specific lung disease, or it can cause progressive inflammatory lung disease and destruction.' "
Is nontuberculous mycobacterial lung (NTM) disease contagious?,"'NTM lung infection in humans is predominantly due to environmental exposures so human-to-human or animal-to-human transmission is very rare, unlike other contagious mycobacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy.''One specific group of individuals who are at a known risk of human-to-human transmission are those with underlying ''cystic fibrosis''. Apart from this specific subset of individuals, there is no evidence of human-to-human contact of any other NTM species.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung infections?,"'The most common symptom of NTM lung disease is a chronic or recurring dry ''cough'', occasionally with sputum. However, most people with NTM lung disease have symptoms that are nonspecific, and can vary greatly from person to person, for example:''As NTM disease progresses, there may be a ''loss of appetite'' or weight, fevers, or ''night sweats''.''NTM lung infection often is difficult to diagnose because symptoms are similar to those of other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (''COPD'') ''bronchiectasis'', or cystic fibrosis.'

Who gets nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease?,"'Risk factors nontuberculous pulmonary disease vary because there are environmental related risk factors, and risk factors related to specific individuals.''Environmental related risk factors:'' Certain activities can increase the risk of acquiring NTM lung disease because nontuberculous mycobacteria frequently are found in water, soil, and dispersed in the air. Examples of specific exposures to NTM lung infection include ''swimming'' (water), gardening (soil), or using hot tubs (air).''Individual related risk factors: ''People with certain underlying lung disease, for example, ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''), cystic fibrosis, or ''asthma'', may be predisposed to NTM infections due and impaired ability to clear the initial exposure. Moreover, people who have underlying immunodeficiency (such as ''HIV'' or ''AIDS'') or are on immunosuppressant agents (antibiotics, ''chemotherapy'', or ''corticosteroids'') are at an increased risk of developing NTM pulmonary disease.'

What are the treatment guidelines for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease?,"'The decision to start treatment for NTM is influenced by the:''Treatment of NTM pulmonary disease typically requires a combination of antibiotic therapies depending on the severity of symptoms. A usual regimen consists of between three and five different antibiotics. Individuals with mild to moderate disease typically can be treated with an intermittent regimen of antibiotics daily or three times per week. Severe NTM disease may require daily antibiotic therapy. Moreover, some individuals may need injectable intravenous (IV) medication. If injectable medication is not practical or is contraindicated due to an underlying medical condition or ''allergy'', nebulized medication may be used instead.''Most importantly, monotherapy with a single antibiotic or dual therapy with two antibiotics alone are not used for the treatment of mycobacterial pulmonary disease. The ultimate goal of treatment is a microbiological goal of treating NTM to convert sputum cultures or biopsy-proven cultures from positive to negative.''Treatment success may require the following:''Antibiotic treatment typically continues for a minimum of 12 months after culture conversion treatment success to prevent recurrence. Rarely, surgery may be required to remove a portion of the lung. This type of surgery may be an option for those patients with localized areas of severe pulmonary disease who do not respond to the typical antibiotic regimen.'  Severity of NTM-pulmonary disease Risk of progressive NTM-pulmonary disease Presence of comorbidity and the goals of treatment Frequent sputum cultures to look for NTM. Clinical improvement within 3-6 months should be assessed. Within 12 months of appropriate antibiotic therapy, patients should convert their sputum culture and or biopsy to negative. After completion of therapy, patients should remain culture negative for 12 months."
What are the side effects of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection treatment ?,"'Treatment side effects of NTM lung infection typically are typically side effects from the antibiotics used to treat the infection, examples include:' Fever and a rash Hepatitis Nerve injury leading to loss of sensation Optic neuritis (loss of red or green color discrimination) Loss of vision Orange discoloration of saliva, urine and tears Staining of soft contact lenses GI upset (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) Fever and a rash Hepatitis Flu-like symptoms Dizziness or Vertigo Hearing loss Ringing in ears (tinnitus) Stomach (digestive, gastrointestinal upset) Decreased hearing Hepatitis GI upset Headache Insomnia Anxiety Tendinitis GI upset Low blood counts Fever and a rash"
Can nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) disease be cured?,"'A cure for NTM is possible and long-term success rates of treating this infection can be as high as 86%. If a cure is not possible, treatment may allow for stabilization of lung disease and prevention of continued lung destruction. Unfortunately, once underlying lung destruction occurs there is no cure for the structural destruction of the lung itself.' "
What is the life expectancy for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease?,"'Overall life expectancy for NTM lung disease can be normal. However, there are certain characteristics, which can be associated with more complications and a higher likelihood of death.' "
What are the complications of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease?," In individuals with NTM with known underlying lung disease, NTM typically resembles tuberculosis only with less severe symptoms of cough, weight loss, and disease predominantly in the upper portion of the cavities within the lung (literally destruction and holes involving the air sacs). Since the mycobacteria are relatively slow growing, there may be extensive disease and lung destruction by the time it is diagnosed. In individuals with NTM and underlying lung disease, the pattern of disease usually is less severe. The typical symptoms can be a persistent cough with sputum production, but usually there is no fever or weight loss. A syndrome where the right middle lobe or left lingula area of the lung is involved is sometimes called Lady Windermere syndrome. Another form of NTM pulmonary disease is hypersensitivity pneumonitis syndrome, which is frequently associated with hot tub use. The NTM thrive in hot water especially since temperatures over 84 F (29.4 C) can cause chlorine to lose its ability to kill germs. Another name for this is ""hot tub lung,"" and symptoms are typically cough, weight loss, breathlessness, high fevers, wheezing, and fatigue. Symptoms can worsen with each hot tub exposure. In individuals with NTM, where disease has spread, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause disease in other organs and tissues. This spread of NTM primarily occurs in individuals who are immunocompromised, for example, those with AIDS or in chemotherapy. The incidence of spread of the disease has drastically reduced since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS and the use of antibiotics in AIDS patients to prevent mycobacterial disease as described previously."
Can nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease be prevented?,"'Since NTM are found soil, water, and air, primary prevention has been difficult, however, there may be a future role for avoidance and prevention for those individuals who are known to be at high risk of acquiring the disease. Currently, there no consensus on prevention among NTM experts.''Transmission of NTM infections in the healthcare setting can be decreased by avoiding tap water or tap water derived fluids from being used to clean surgical equipment, IV catheters, or endoscopes. Updated sterilization guidelines should be used based on known exposure patterns. Moreover, some known skin disinfectants can grow NTM and therefore they are avoided on open wounds.''Antibiotic therapy can be used as a preventative measure in a certain group of individuals. Due to the high incidence and severity of disease in certain individuals with ''HIV'' infection, preventative therapy for NTM is recommended with a single oral antibiotic as a prophylactic measure.'

What is Noonan syndrome?,"'Noonan syndrome is a condition that affects many areas of the body. It is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome?,"'People with Noonan syndrome have distinctive facial features such as a deep groove in the area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), widely spaced eyes that are usually pale blue or blue-green in color, and low-set ears that are rotated backward. Affected individuals may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), poor alignment of the ''teeth'', and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Many children with Noonan syndrome have a short neck and both children and adults may have excess neck skin (also called webbing) and a low hairline at the back of the neck.''Approximately 50 to 70 percent of individuals with Noonan syndrome have short stature. At birth, they are usually of normal length and weight, but growth slows over time. Abnormal levels of growth hormone may contribute to the slow growth.''Individuals with Noonan syndrome often have either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some affected people may also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).''Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart defect. The most common heart defect is a narrowing of the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the ''lungs'' (pulmonary valve stenosis). Some affected individuals have ''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'', which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.''A variety of ''bleeding disorders'' have been associated with Noonan syndrome. Some people may have excessive ''bruising'', ''nosebleeds'', or prolonged bleeding following injury or surgery. Women with a ''bleeding disorder'' typically have excessive bleeding during ''menstruation'' (menorrhagia) or ''childbirth''.''Adolescent males with Noonan syndrome typically experience delayed ''puberty''. Affected individuals go through puberty starting at age 13 or 14 and have a reduced pubertal growth spurt. Most males with Noonan syndrome have undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), which may be related to delayed puberty or to ''infertility'' (inability to father a child) later in life. Females with Noonan syndrome typically have normal puberty and ''fertility''.''Noonan syndrome can cause a variety of other signs and symptoms. Most children diagnosed with Noonan syndrome have normal intelligence, but a small percentage has special educational needs, and some have intellectual disability. Some affected individuals have vision or ''hearing'' problems. Infants with Noonan syndrome may be born with puffy hands and ''feet'' caused by a buildup of fluid (''lymphedema''), which can go away on its own. Affected infants may also have feeding problems, which typically get better by age 1 or 2. Older individuals can also develop lymphedema, usually in the ankles and lower legs.'  "
How common is Noonan syndrome?,"'Noonan syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 people.' "
What genes are related to Noonan syndrome?,"'Mutations in the PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes cause Noonan syndrome.''Most cases of Noonan syndrome result from mutations in one of three genes, PTPN11, SOS1, or RAF1. PTPN11 gene mutations account for approximately 50 percent of all cases of Noonan syndrome. SOS1 gene mutations account for 10 to 15 percent and RAF1 gene mutations account for 5 to 10 percent of Noonan syndrome cases. About 2 percent of people with Noonan syndrome have mutations in the KRAS gene and usually have a more severe or atypical form of the disorder. It is not known how many cases are caused by mutations in the BRAF or NRAS genes, but it is likely a very small proportion. The cause of Noonan syndrome in the remaining 20 percent of people with this disorder is unknown.''The PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes all provide instructions for making proteins that are important in signaling pathways needed for the proper formation of several types of tissue during development. These proteins also play roles in cell division, cell movement, and cell differentiation (the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions). Mutations in any of the genes listed above cause the resulting protein to be continuously active, rather than switching on and off in response to cell signals. This constant activation disrupts the regulation of systems that control cell growth and division, leading to the characteristic features of Noonan syndrome.' "
How do people inherit Noonan syndrome?,"'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.''In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.' "
What other names do people use for Noonan syndrome?," familial Turner syndrome Female Pseudo-Turner Syndrome Male Turner Syndrome Noonan-Ehmke syndrome pseudo-Ullrich-Turner syndrome Turner-like syndrome Turner's phenotype, karyotype normal Turner syndrome in female with X chromosome Ullrich-Noonan syndrome"
What are normal blood sugar levels before and after eating?,"'The normal ranges for blood sugar levels in adults who do not have diabetes before eating or fasting the range begins at 72-99mg/dL while fasting ranges for those being treated for type 1 or ''type 2 diabetes'' range from 80 -130 mg/dL. According to the American Diabetes Association normal blood sugar levels before and after eating should be 80-130 mg/dL before eating a meal (fasting), and less than 180 mg/dL about 1-2 hours after eating a meal''High blood sugar'' ranges for people who don’t have diabetes begins at 140 mg/dL or greater while for those being treated for diabetes, the high range begins at 180 mg/dL , called ''hypoglycemia''.'  "
Are high levels of blood sugar dangerous?,"'Yes, ''high blood sugar'' levels can be dangerous. Although high blood sugar levels commonly produce symptoms of excessive urination, excessive ''thirst'' and hunger, and ''weight loss'', over time these high blood sugar levels can cause lower extremity paresthesias (“pins and needles” sensations) and/or loss of feeling, blurry vision and a tendency to be at higher risk for infections and many other medical problems including kidney and eye damage, ''heart attack'', and ''stroke''. Very high blood sugar levels (for example, 1000 or more mg/dL) can cause diabetic ''ketoacidosis'', which can lead to ''loss of consciousness'' and possible death. The treatment for excessively high blood sugar involves IV fluids and insulin.'  "
Are low blood sugar levels dangerous?,"'Yes, ''low blood sugar'' symptoms can cause problems such as hunger, nervousness, ''perspiration'', ''dizziness'' and even ''confusion''; if untreated, ''low blood sugar'' (also termed hypoglycemia) may result in unconsciousness, ''seizures'', ''coma'', or death. Low blood sugar levels begin at 70 mg/dL or less. People with diabetes who take too much medication (insulin) or take their usual amount but then eat less or ''exercise'' more than usual can develop hypoglycemia. Although much rarer, hypoglycemia may develop in some people without diabetes when they take someone else’s medication, have excessive ''alcohol'' consumption, develop severe ''hepatitis'', or develop a rare ''tumor'' of the pancreas (''insulinoma''). The treatment for hypoglycemia is oral glucose intake (15. 0 grams of sugar, for example, 1 tablespoon of sugar, honey, ''corn'' syrup, or IV fluids containing glucose. Recheck your blood sugar levels in about 15 minutes after treatment is advised.' "
What can you do to manage your blood glucose levels?,"'A good start in how to maintain normal blood glucose is ""How can you reduce your blood sugar levels"" in this article. Don\'t eat foods high in carbohydrates and sugar such as buttered potatoes, fatty foods, candy, and sugary desserts like cake with frosting. ''Diet'' modification is a major step in your management of diabetes. Use a blood sugar log book with the date, time, and values of your or you and your doctor to help you manage your ''type 1 diabetes'' or ''type 2 diabetes'', and use a blood glucose home test kit to get glucose test results. Additionally, log any change in symptoms over time. The log book will enable you and your doctor to modify treatments (for example, amount insulin to take) and actions to obtain the best management of your diabetes.' "
What is bad cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol (a type of fat or ''lipid'') moves in the body combined with proteins. This combination of cholesterol and proteins is called lipoproteins. The low-density lipoprotein or ''LDL cholesterol'' is called bad cholesterol. High levels of this cholesterol increase risk for heart diseases and ''stroke''.''When you have high levels of ''LDL cholesterol'' in the body, the ''LDL cholesterol'' can accumulate on the walls of the blood vessels forming a ‘plaque.’ The continuous cholesterol build-up or a plaque narrows the inside of the blood vessels with time. The narrowed blood vessel hampers the blood supply to the concerned organ. Thus, when the plaque is present in the heart, it can cause ''angina'' (''chest pain'') or a ''heart attack''. Plaque build-up in the brain can cause a ''stroke''.''Another type of cholesterol is HDL\xa0(high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. It is also called “good”\xa0cholesterol as it absorbs cholesterol and carries it back to the liver. The liver then removes the cholesterol from the body. ''HDL cholesterol'', thus, can lower your risk for heart diseases and ''stroke''.' "
How often should I get my cholesterol levels checked?,"'The frequency of getting your cholesterol levels tested depends on your age, presence of risk factors, and family history like a history of heart diseases, ''stroke'', ''diabetes'', or ''high cholesterol''.''The following provides general recommendations for various age groups.''People who are 19 years of age or younger should:''People who are age 20 years or older:' Get the first test done between ages 9 to 11 years Repeat the test every 5 years For children, who have a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke, the testing may start at 2 years of age Those between the age of 20 to 44 years should get tested every 5 years Women in the age group 45 to 54 years should get tested every 5 years Men in the age group 45 to 65 years should get their cholesterol levels checked every 1-2 years Women in the age group 55 to 65 years should get tested every 1-2 years"
What do VBAC and ERCS mean?,"'The term vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) is used when a woman gives birth vaginally and has had a cesarean delivery in the past. A vaginal birth may include normal delivery and assisted birth by forceps or a vacuum cup.''ERCS means elective (planned) repeat cesarean section. You will usually have a planned cesarean delivery after 39 weeks of ''pregnancy'' because ''babies'' born by cesarean delivery earlier than this may have ''breathing'' problems.''If you are fit and healthy and tick off the appropriate boxes, both VBAC and ERCS are safe choices for you with very little risk.' "
What are the benefits of VBAC?,'Benefits include:' No surgical complications A shorter hospital stay Quicker recovery Quicker return to normal activities Higher chances of vaginal birth in future pregnancies No multiple risks of cesarean deliveries such as placental problems To be able to breastfeed your child successfully
What are the risks of VBAC?,"'Although vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) does come with risks, many women are able to have one with no complications at all. A failed trial of ''labor'' in a woman who had a previous cesarean delivery is associated with possible serious complications.''Complications in the mother are as follows:''Complications in the baby are as follows:' Pelvic floor disorders Uterine rupture (rare, <1%) Burst opening of the cesarean scar May require a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) and then you will never be able to get pregnant Death An increased heart rate of the baby during vaginal delivery Sepsis Trauma Brain damage Death of a baby in the womb Stillbirth (death of a baby after birth)"
Facts you should know about labor and delivery,"""Every woman's experience is unique. Below are typical guidelines that will help you understand what to expect during ""'labor'' and delivery.' Normal labor can begin three weeks prior to the anticipated due date up until two weeks afterwards. There is no way to precisely predict when labor will begin. In the first stage of labor the cervix dilates and effaces (thins out). Once contractions begin, they usually increase in strength, duration, and frequency. The second stage of labor begins when the cervix is completely (i.e. 10 centimeters) dilated. It ends when, following expulsive efforts (pushing) by the mother, the infant is delivered. During the third stage of labor, the placenta and membranes are delivered. There are a number of methods for monitoring the fetus that may be used during labor. Options for pain control during labor include breathing exercises, imagery, relaxation techniques, medications, and regional anesthesia."
What are the early symptoms and signs of labor?,"'Signs and symptoms of impending labor are not uniform among all women.''Early symptoms and signs that labor is approaching are ""lightening"" and passing the mucous plug.''Lightening is a term used to denote the descent of the fetal head into the pelvis as labor approaches. It can occur up to two weeks prior to the onset of labor, or it may not occur at all. At that time, there may be increased pressure on the maternal bladder accompanied by the urge to urinate more frequently. Many women find it easier to breathe after lightening occurs because upward pressure on the ''diaphragm'' diminishes.''Release or passage of the ""''mucus'' plug"" can be another sign that labor is near. Mucus produced by the cervical glands normally blocks the entrance to the cervix and helps prevent infection. When the fetal head impinges on the cervix, mucus from the cervical glands, along with a small amount of blood, is expelled. This results in a blood-tinged or brownish discharge being expelled from the vagina. Passage of the mucus plug may occur days before or after labor begins. It is also common after a vaginal examination.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs that labor is near or has begun?,"'Spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes is referred to as one\'s ""water breaking."" This means that the membranes that surround the baby have ruptured, and clear ''amniotic fluid'' is often expelled from the vagina at that time. Once this occurs, labor will generally ensue spontaneously. If it does not, induction of labor may be necessary to avoid infection ascending upward through the vagina into the uterus. Most commonly rupture of the membranes does not occur until labor has already begun.''Finally, labor begins with the onset of contractions. At that point, the cervix begins to thin out and dilate. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of labor. Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or ""''false labor'',"" occur toward the end of ''pregnancy'' during the ''third trimester'', and they do not necessarily signify that labor is imminent. Some women even experience these contractions during the ''second trimester''. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of ''true labor'' are, and they do not occur at regular intervals.' "
What are the stages of labor and delivery?,"'Labor is divided into three stages; corresponding to the dilation of the cervix, the birth of the baby, and the delivery of the placenta.' "
Stage 1 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 1 is the longest stage of labor. It is characterized by thinning (effacement) and dilation of the cervix. Sometimes doctors subdivide this stage into three separate phases: the latent phase, the active phase, and the transition phase. Contractions, occurring with increasing frequency, are present during all phases of Stage 1. Early contractions last from 30 to 45 seconds and are several minutes apart. During the latent phase, the cervix dilates to about 3 to 4 centimeters. Many women are admitted to the hospital during this phase. In the active phase, the cervix dilates to about 7 centimeters, and the contractions become more intense. During the transition phase, the cervix dilates completely to 10 centimeters, and the contractions are strong and painful. Contractions can occur every 3 to 4 minutes and last from 60 to 90 seconds.' "
Stage 2 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 2 refers to the passage of the baby through the birth canal until delivery. It begins when the cervix has fully dilated and voluntary pushing is initiated. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''""pushing"" stage'"". The head is typically delivered first, and sustained pushing allows for delivery of the infant's shoulders and body. Some women prefer different body positions during this stage of labor. These may include kneeling, squatting, lying down, or even on the hands and knees. This stage may take minutes to a few hours. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a woman giving birth for the first time should complete Stage 2 within 2 hours if no regional anesthesia has been used, and up to 3 hours if she has received anesthesia. Stage 2 is usually shorter in subsequent ""'pregnancies'', up to 2 hours if anesthesia has been given and 1 hour if none has been used.' "
Stage 3 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 3 begins at the time the infant is delivered. In stage 3, the placenta and fetal membranes are expelled. The placenta and membranes are sometimes referred to as the ''afterbirth''. Stage 3 usually takes only 5 to 10 minutes, but it can take up to 30 minutes. Mild contractions may occur during stage 3, and there may be some associated bleeding.' "
What are pain control options during labor and delivery?,"'Many women opt not to receive medications or interventions for ''pain'' control during labor and delivery, while others choose medical or procedural pain control methods. Several different opioid analgesic and opioid agonist medications are acceptable for pain control. Examples are''Regional anesthesia is another option. This can be administered as an epidural, spinal, or combined spinal-epidural block. Research has shown that regional anesthesia is more effective than injectable medications for controlling pain. Moreover, large-scale ''clinical trials'' did not show an increase in the ''C-section'' rate in women who opted for regional anesthesia.''Women who choose not to receive pain medications can use breathing techniques and/or imagery for pain control. Relaxation techniques and ''yoga'' have also proved beneficial.'  injectable meperidine, fentanyl, morphine, butorphanol (Stadol), and nalbuphine (Nubain)."
What kind of monitoring is done during labor and delivery?," During the first stage of labor, you will likely have pelvic examinations to check the dilation and thinning of the cervix. The baby's heart rate is usually checked intermittently with a Doppler device, or continuous electronic fetal monitoring may be employed. External fetal monitoring is accomplished by placing a transducer on the maternal abdominal wall. The transducer detects the fetal heart rate and displays it on a visual tracing. Internal monitoring is another method used to follow the fetal heartbeat. With this technology, a small electrode is passed through the cervix and attached to the fetal scalp. The type of monitoring selected depends upon a number of factors, and it will vary from patient to patient. Your health-care professional will choose the most appropriate type for your individual situation. Continuous fetal monitoring is almost universally used if the woman receives epidural anesthesia, or if oxytocin (Pitocin) is used to induce labor. It is also employed with high-risk pregnancies or if the labor is complicated."
What is a cardiac catheter ablation?,"'Cardiac (''heart'') ablation is a procedure performed to correct heart arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythm/beat). Cardiac ablation works by intentionally injuring or destroying (ablating) and scarring the tissue in the heart that triggers the abnormal heart rhythm.''The ablated parts of the heart tissue can take 6 to 8 weeks to heal completely. During this time, after the cardiac ablation procedure, patients may continue to have irregular heartbeats for which the doctor may prescribe antiarrhythmic medication.' "
How is cardiac ablation performed?,"'During cardiac ablation''The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation. During cardiac ablation, the doctor inserts catheters (long, flexible tubes) through the vein or the artery in the groin and into the heart with the help of radiological guidance to deliver heat energy, extreme ''cold'' or laser to treat the tissues in the heart causing arrhythmias. If the patient is not anesthetized, they may feel mild chest discomfort when the catheter is in the heart to ablate the tissue. Even if the procedure is successful, patients may require repeated treatments. The procedure used to take about 10 hours to perform, but with recent advances, cardiac ablation now takes about 3 hours.''Open surgery''Cardiac ablation may sometimes be performed as ''open heart surgery''. Open surgery is generally not preferred because it is more invasive and the time taken to perform surgery is much longer. The recovery time after open surgery is much longer as well.''After cardiac ablation' The patient’s vitals are monitored. Patients may be discharged the same day after surgery or after 24 hours. Patients may experience chest discomfort and pain, which can be treated with painkillers. Antibiotics may be prescribed to prevent infection. Most patients can return to their normal activities in a few days after the procedure. It is advised to take medications as prescribed by the doctor and follow up regularly."
Lifestyle modifications,"'Certain lifestyle changes are advised to improve and maintain the health of the heart and overall body' Decrease salt consumption, which can help reduce blood pressure Eat a healthy diet Get regular physical activity Maintain ideal body weight by staying within normal BMI limits (18.5 to 24.9) Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol Avoid recreational drugs Manage emotional and physical stress"
What are the complications of cardiac ablation?,"'Cardiac ablation carries a risk of complications, including' Bleeding Infection Damage to the blood vessels due to the catheter passing through them Trauma to the heart, such as a puncture  Damage to the normal electrical system of the heart, which could worsen the arrhythmia requiring additional procedures to correct it, such as pacemaker insertion Injury to the heart valves Heart attack Blood clots in the veins of the legs or the lungs causing respiratory failure Stroke Damage to the kidneys due to the dye used during the procedure Death in rare cases"
What is norovirus?,"'Norovirus'' is an ''enterovirus'' that causes ''food poisoning'' symptoms in individuals. It is sometimes termed the ""''stomach flu'',"" but it is not related to the true ''flu'' ''viruses'' (''influenza'' ''viruses'') that cause respiratory problems. ''Norovirus'' is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) to be the most common cause of acute ''gastroenteritis'' in the United States (about 19-21 million infections per year with about 570-800 deaths). Although most cases are self-limiting, some patients (children or the elderly, for example) may develop ''dehydration'' or other serious consequences, including death.' "
Is norovirus contagious?,"'Noroviruses are highly ''contagious''. These viruses can easily infect men, women, and children. There are many subtypes of norovirus so that if you are infected with one norovirus type, it does not protect you against infection with one of the other types. The CDC estimates that in the U.S., every person will get about five infections (five different norovirus types) during their lifetime.' "
What is the contagious period for norovirus?,'Individuals are ''contagious'' as soon as the symptoms develop and may remain contagious between three days to two weeks after symptoms are gone.' 
How will I know if I have norovirus?,"'Norovirus causes ''diarrhea'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''stomach pain''; other symptoms may appear such as ''fever'', ''headache'', and/or body ''aches''. Patients usually report feeling extremely ill and weak.''Because norovirus is usually associated with contaminated foods or fluids, usually an outbreak of the disease is seen among many people who have consumed the same contaminated food or liquids. Consequently, you may suspect you have norovirus if people who have consumed the same foods that you have consumed display the same symptoms (for example, cruise-ship passengers). Other outbreaks happen when an infected individual lives in crowded conditions (for example, dorms or barracks).'""Most outbreaks of norovirus are diagnosed clinically from the patient's history and physical exam. Viral cultures can prove the diagnosis, but by the time test results are available (a few days), the symptoms are usually decreasing or are gone."" "
How is norovirus transmitted?,"'Noroviruses are easily spread to individuals by both direct and indirect contact with infected individuals. Direct contact usually occurs when people are taking care of infected patients (fecal/oral contact by changing diapers and/or bedding, for example). Norovirus can be transmitted or spread indirectly by body secretions (feces, saliva, or vomitus) to other individuals or to foods or liquids; individuals who are food handlers can easily cause outbreaks if they become infected and try to stay on the job. Norovirus can spread rapidly by indirect contact since the virus can remain viable for up to a few days on some surfaces.''Individuals can pass norovirus directly from person to person and indirectly by touching objects (utensils, for example) contaminated with norovirus or eating foods contaminated with norovirus. One study has showed that ''dogs'' may get the virus from one individual and then pass the virus to another human.' "
How will I know I am cured of norovirus?,"'The symptoms of norovirus infection usually last between 24 to about 72 hours, after which people usually recover completely. Although you may be ""cured"" of the type of norovirus that infected you, you are still susceptible to infection with other types of noroviruses. Individuals with a suppressed immune system, infants, young children, and the elderly may easily develop ''dehydration'' with norovirus infection; those with ''dehydration'' need to be treated urgently (with oral or intravenous hydration) to prevent additional problems and prolongation of infection.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about norovirus?,"'Norovirus infection can cause serious problems in those individuals who have more severe symptoms. Parents of children with signs of ''dehydration'' (for example, dry ''mucus'' membranes, reduced or no urine production) and adult individuals with similar problems need to contact a medical ''caregiver'' urgently. In addition, the following situations should trigger an urgent visit to a physician or an emergency department in any individual who may have norovirus infection:'   Children vomiting for more than one to two days Children under the age of 6 months with vomiting and/or diarrhea Mental-status changes in children or adults Individuals with other underlying medical problems (diabetes, congenital abnormalities, immune compromise, for example) Pregnancy Severe abdominal pain Blood in diarrhea fluid or vomit"
What is a norovirus?,"'A norovirus is a small virus that contains RNA and is surrounded by a protein coating. By sequencing the RNA, scientists have discovered that there are many different types of norovirus. Originally, ''strains'' were named based on the city in which they were first identified. Thus, one common strain used to be called Norwalk virus. Based on genetic typing, we now know that there are at least 25 different strains of norovirus that affect humans. The RNA genome in noroviruses easily mutates to produce new norovirus types. The disease occurs worldwide with peak occurrence from about November until the end of May in the U.S. Therefore, the infection is sometimes termed ""winter ''vomiting'' disease.""''Norovirus infection is the most common cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in the U.S. Although some people call this the ""''stomach flu'',"" norovirus is not related to the ''influenza'' virus. According to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC), there are 19-21 million cases of norovirus infection annually in the U.S., of which one-quarter are related to food-borne outbreaks. Norovirus infections annually cause about 570-800 deaths in the U.S., mainly in young children and the elderly. Outbreaks occur throughout the year but are more common in the winter months. There is no specific treatment for norovirus. Fortunately, the disease is self-limited and simple supportive measures are sufficient to care for most people unless they become dehydrated.'""Outbreaks of norovirus can occur almost anywhere in the world. In 2012, a new strain named GII.4 Sydney was identified. Since the first outbreak, the virus was quickly detected in New Zealand, France, and the U.S. A new outbreak of norovirus occurred at Yellowstone National Park, causing illness in about 200 visitors and camp employees in June 2013. A new strain of norovirus has been detected in southern China and is designated as GII.17. Unfortunately, the virus has mutated enough that most people will not be immune even if they've had a norovirus infection in the past.""'Outbreaks occur frequently. In 2015, outbreaks occurred in cruise ships, ''restaurants'', and schools. For example, the ''Star Princess'' cruise ship had at least two different outbreaks that sickened hundreds of people in 2015. In August 2015, 98 customers and 17 employees became ill due to a norovirus outbreak at the Chipotle Mexican Grill in Simi Valley, Calif. Another major outbreak also occurred in 17 schools in a Nevada school district where over 1,145 people so far have developed a norovirus infection as of October 2015. A recent outbreak occurred in England where in one week, there was a 70% increase in norovirus infections to as many as 1,336 people hospitalized due to norovirus in December 2017. Decontamination of surfaces (see prevention section below) and of objects that are likely to be touched is important as researchers have indicated that only about 10-20 virus particles are needed to cause infection.' "
What causes a norovirus infection? How are norovirus infections transmitted?,"'Infection occurs when humans inadvertently ingest material contaminated with small amounts of fluids or feces from an infected person. It only takes a small number of ''viruses'' to cause infection, so even microscopic amounts of feces or fluids can be contagious.''An infected person with vomiting or ''diarrhea'' can contaminate their environment directly, or they may indirectly spread virus particles through aerosolized droplets when vomiting; however, the main route is by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. Contamination may also occur in food and/or in water, which has led to infection spreading widely in restaurants or aboard cruise ships. Outbreaks in school systems occur regularly, sometimes spreading widely. The virus is very hardy and can live for days or weeks on surfaces, including clothing. Outbreaks often occur when groups of people congregate (for example, cruise ships, dormitories, schools, day-care centers).' "
"What are norovirus infection symptoms and signs in adults, children, and babies?","'Most people get sick within one day of ingesting norovirus (range 12-48 hours) so the virus has a short incubation period. Symptoms and signs include vomiting, watery ''diarrhea'', or both. ''Fever'' occurs in one-third to one-half of infected people. Cramping abdominal or ''stomach pain'' and a general feeling of ''tiredness'', ''headache'', and muscle aches are common.''Infected people are usually thirsty, although they may have trouble keeping fluids down. In general, if patients can orally ingest about the same amount of fluid they lose through diarrhea and vomiting, they will do well. Symptoms in adults may be different than symptoms in children. Young children and ''babies'' may not complain of ''thirst'' but may appear listless or lethargic as they become dehydrated. Symptoms may be more severe in debilitated, elderly patients or ''pregnant'' women. People who are unable to replace their fluids and develop signs of dehydration need medical care.''Most people have a mild illness that lasts two to three days. In contrast to bacterial diarrheas, such as those caused by ''Shigella'' or '' Campylobacter'' bacteria, norovirus does not cause blood or pus in the ''stool''. The length of infection may be prolonged in patients who are in the hospital or in young children.''Norovirus has been associated with severe inflammation of the colon in newborns and with disease flares in children who have ''inflammatory bowel disease'', but it is not yet clear what role norovirus plays in these conditions.'  "
What is the incubation period for a norovirus infection? How long are people infected with norovirus contagious?,"'Norovirus may have a prolonged infection period that starts even before someone gets sick. There is a short lag or incubation period (up to two days) between the time that people acquire the virus and the time they get symptoms. People may be contagious during this period. All people are contagious while they are having symptoms or showing signs.'""Although the most contagious period is over when the patient's symptoms resolve, even some people who appear to have recovered completely after a norovirus infection may continue to shed the virus for weeks in their ""'stool'' and may be a source of infection to others. People with compromised immune systems (for example, those receiving ''chemotherapy'' or undergoing organ transplant) may shed the virus for months. However, in general, most individuals become noncontagious about 72 hours after symptoms have resolved. Consequently, although it may be difficult for parents to do so, children and adults should not go back to school, day care, or work until they have been symptom-free for three days.' "
How is a norovirus infection diagnosed?,"'Because the symptoms of norovirus are similar to those of other common viral diarrheas like ''rotavirus'', it is necessary to do specific tests to identify the virus. Norovirus cannot be cultured in a laboratory. However, the RNA inside the virus may be detected directly using ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') tests, and these tests are the ones that are most commonly used. Enzyme-based immunoassays (EIA) can also be used to detect the virus in stool samples. EIAs use special antibodies that attach to virus particles. In addition, the Ridascreen Norovirus 3rd Generation EIA assay is approved for use to detect norovirus when a number of people have simultaneously contracted gastroenteritis and there is a clear avenue for virus transmission, such as a shared location or food source. However, this new test is not sensitive enough for definitive diagnosis of norovirus infection in an individual. The ''human body'' makes antibodies against norovirus, and these can be identified with immunoassay testing of blood samples. Unfortunately, it takes 10-14 days for the body to make antibodies, so this test is not useful for real-time diagnosis. It is also possible to see the virus particles using electron microscopy, although this is mostly a research tool. Currently, the preferred test for norovirus according to the CDC is the PCR test. This test helps distinguish between other diseases (for example, rotavirus and ''Salmonella'' infections) that may produce similar symptoms.''Once norovirus has been confirmed in an outbreak setting, it is not necessary to test every person. Rather, people with typical symptoms are assumed to have acquired the virus.' "
"What is the treatment for norovirus infections in adults, children, and babies?","'There is no specific treatment or medication for norovirus. It is important that infected individuals remain well hydrated, drinking plenty of fluids. Fluids containing electrolytes and sugars should be encouraged. ''Over-the-counter'' antidiarrheal medications may be used according to directions but should be avoided in cases with severe ''abdominal pain'' or ''fever''. Some researchers advise people to avoid these medications if possible as they may prolong the disease.'  "
What are possible complications of a norovirus infection?,"'Although most cases of norovirus infection are mild, complications may occur. Complications are related to the degree of dehydration. People who cannot keep up with fluid losses may require hospitalization for intravenous fluids.''Approximately 10% of infected people seek medical attention. Very young children and infants are at high risk for dehydration because they cannot communicate their symptoms and because dehydration may occur rapidly. Pregnant women should pay particular attention to keeping up with fluid losses and ''electrolyte'' imbalances as these problems, if severe, may lead to preterm ''labor''.''Although norovirus infection is not fatal, it can contribute to mortality by causing underlying illnesses to become worse. Elderly, debilitated people are especially at risk for complications related to dehydration, including ''kidney failure''.' "
What is the prognosis of a norovirus infection?,"'Norovirus infection is a self-limited illness that lasts two to three days in most people. As discussed above, complications are usually related to dehydration or underlying illnesses. In some countries where poor hydration already may exist in children, many may die from dehydration if IV replenishment is not available. In 2006, the World Health Organization recommended a new prepackaged oral rehydration salts (ORS) formula that can be shipped to underdeveloped countries and simply poured into clean water that can prevent dehydration in many patients. This approach has improved the prognosis for many children in developing countries.' "
Is it possible to prevent norovirus infections? Is there a norovirus vaccine?,"'Once a person is sick, it is important for caretakers and household contacts to use good hand hygiene. This includes washing hands after coming in contact with the person or his environment. Hands should also be washed before preparing food or touching the face. The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water over using hand sanitizers; alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not very effective but have been shown to reduce the rate of transmission in some settings. Silverware and dishes should not be shared. Diluted chlorine bleach (5 to 25 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water) may be used to clean solid surfaces. Other disinfectants like Lysol can help decontaminate some surfaces.''Norovirus infections can be prevented by using good hand hygiene with soap and water (not alcohol solutions) and avoiding contact with sick individuals and their environment. This is much harder than it sounds. One sick crew member on a cruise ship can contaminate food served to hundreds of people. Contamination while picking fresh vegetables or fruit can lead to widespread outbreaks as the product is sold across the country. Strict hygiene standards for food handlers can help reduce the risk of outbreaks. Many investigators suggest routine washing of fruits and vegetables before serving may also help reduce or prevent infections.''Noroviruses may also be spread in a hospital or nursing-home environment. The CDC has published guidelines for institutions to follow to reduce the infection rate. Hand hygiene is highlighted as the single most important component of these infection-control measures. Hospital epidemiologists and people with infection-control training should be contacted whenever an outbreak is suspected within a hospital or institution. Public-health officials should be notified whenever there is suspicion for a community-based outbreak. The major risk factor for norovirus infection is close contact with a person who has the infection or with any items they touch or on which they may ''cough''. The risk is increased if an infected person prepares your food or lives with you and others in a relatively confined space (dorm, cruise ship, school).''Unfortunately, people who get norovirus do not have immunity against future infections. Although the body makes antibodies against the infecting strain, there are many strains that cause infection. The virus constantly creates small mutations in its RNA to make new strains that evade the human immune system.''Because there are many different strains of norovirus, it has been difficult to make a ''vaccine''. However, this is an active area of research, and there are some ''vaccines'' that have shown promise in mouse (murine) models. Vaccine trials are now beginning in humans, but there is no commercial vaccine currently available.' "
Where can people get more information about norovirus infections?,'The CDC web sites listed in the references provide additional information for patients and clinicians.' 
What causes nosebleeds?,"'The nose is a part of the body rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is located in a vulnerable position protruding on the face. As a result, trauma to the face can cause nasal injury and bleeding. The bleeding may be profuse, or simply a minor complication. Nosebleeds can occur spontaneously when the nasal membranes dry out and ''crack''. This is common in dry climates, or during the winter months when the air is dry and warm from household heaters. People are more susceptible to a bloody nose if they take medications that prevent normal blood clotting (''warfarin'' [''Coumadin'', ''Jantoven''], clopidogrel [''Plavix''], aspirin, or any anti-inflammatory medication). In this situation, even a minor trauma could result in significant bleeding.''The incidence of nosebleeds is higher during the colder winter months when upper respiratory infections are more frequent, and the temperature and humidity fluctuate more dramatically. In addition, changes from a bitter ''cold'' outside environment to a warm, dry, heated home result in drying and changes in the nose which make it more susceptible to bleeding. Nosebleeds also occur in hot, dry climates with low humidity, or when there is a change in the seasons. The following risk factors predispose people to nosebleeds:'   Infection Trauma, including self-induced by nose picking (this is a common cause of nosebleeds in children) Allergic and non-allergic rhinitis Hypertension (high blood pressure) Use of blood thinning medications Alcohol abuse Less common causes of nosebleeds include tumors and inherited bleeding problems Hormonal changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of nosebleeds."
How do you stop the common nosebleed?,"'Most people who develop nose bleeding can handle the problem without the need of a treatment by a health-care professional if they follow the step-by-step ''first aid'' recommendations below on how to stop a nosebleed:''Stuffing cotton or tissue into your nose is not recommended.'   Lean forward slightly with the head tilted forward. Leaning back or tilting the head back allows the blood to run back into the sinuses and throat, and can cause gagging or inhaling of blood.Spit out any blood that may collect in your mouth and throat. It may cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if swallowed.Gently, blow any blood clots out of your nose. The nosebleed may worsen slightly when you do this but this is expected. Spit out any blood that may collect in your mouth and throat. It may cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if swallowed. Gently, blow any blood clots out of your nose. The nosebleed may worsen slightly when you do this but this is expected. Pinch all the soft parts of the nose together between the thumb and index finger. Press firmly toward the face - compressing the pinched parts of the nose against the bones of the face. Breathe through your mouth as you do this. Hold the nose for at least five minutes. Repeat as necessary until the nose has stopped bleeding. Sit quietly, keeping the head higher than the level of the heart. Do not lay flat or put your head between your legs. Apply ice (wrapped in a towel) to nose and cheeks afterwards. Oxymetazoline (Afrin), phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neo-Synephrine, Neofrin), or phenylephrine-DM-guaifenesin (Duravent) nasal spray can be used short-term to help with congestion and minor bleeding if you do not have high blood pressure. However, these sprays should not be used for more than a few days at a time, as they can make congestion and nosebleeds worse."
How do you prevent the nose from bleeding again?,"   Go home and rest with head elevated at 30 to 45 degrees. Do not blow your nose or put anything into it. If you have to sneeze, open your mouth so that the air will escape out the mouth and not through the nose. Do not strain during bowel movements. Use a stool softener, for example, docusate (Colace). Do not strain or bend down to lift anything heavy. Try to keep your head higher than the level of your heart. Do not smoke. Eat a diet of soft, cool foods and beverages. No hot liquids for at least 24 hours. Do not take any medications that will thin the blood for example, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others), clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) or warfarin (Coumadin). Do not stop taking any medications without first contacting your doctor. Your doctor may recommend some form of lubricating ointment for the inside of the nose. If re-bleeding occurs, try to clear the nose of blood clots by sniffing in forcefully. A temporary remedy such as a nasal decongestant spray, for example, Afrin or Neo-Synephrine may be helpful. These types of sprays constrict blood vessels. (NOTE: If used for many days at a time, these can cause addiction so they are recommended for short-term use only. Do not use if the patient has high blood pressure.) Repeat the steps above on how to stop the common nosebleed. If bleeding persists, call the doctor and/or go to the nearest emergency department."
What if a person has frequent or chronic nosebleeds?,"'If a nosebleed recurs four times or more in a week, see a health-care professional to determine why this is occurring. Frequent or chronic nosebleeds may be caused by many factors including''If the nosebleed persists or is recurrent, see your health-care professional who may recommend stopping the nosebleed with a heating instrument or chemical swab (cautery of the blood vessel that is causing the trouble), or application of a topical medicine called thrombin that promotes local clotting of blood. Blood tests may be ordered to check for ''bleeding disorders''. If bleeding is still persistent, the doctor may place nasal packs, which compress the vessels and stop the bleeding. In rare situations, you may be admitted to the hospital or require surgical treatment or a procedure where material is used to plug up the bleeding vessels in the nose (angiographic embolization).' Frequent picking or blowing the nose A low humidity environment Chronic allergies Medications including blood thinners, aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, decongestants, or nasal sprays Health conditions that affect normal blood clotting A structural problem within the nose Abnormal blood vessels within the nose (for example Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, a hereditary condition) A polyp or tumor in the nose or sinuses. Use of complementary and alternative medicines such as Ginkgo biloba and vitamin E, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Snorting drugs such as cocaine."
What remedies or medications can you take to prevent nosebleeds?,"'The most common cause of a nosebleeds is drying of the nasal membranes. If a person is prone to recurrent or frequent nosebleeds, it is often helpful to lubricate the nose with an ointment of some type. The ointment can be applied gently with a Q-tip or fingertip up inside the nose, especially on the middle portion (the septum).''Many people use remedies for nosebleeds such as''Nosebleeds in children may be prevented by ensuring children do not pick their nose.'   A + D ointment, methylsalicylate/menthol (Mentholatum, BenGay, Icy Hot), Polysporin, neomycin/bacitracin/polymyxin (Neosporin ointment), or Vaseline. Saline mist nasal spray is often helpful (Ocean Spray)."
When should you go to an emergency room for a nosebleed?," If bleeding cannot be stopped or keeps occurring (persistent or chronic). If bleeding is rapid, or if blood loss is large. If you feel weak or faint. If your nosebleed is associated with trauma to the face, loss of consciousness, or blurry vision. If your nosebleed is associated with a fever or headache. If your infant or baby has a nosebleed, contact the pediatrician."
What should I do if the doctor places nasal packs in my nostrils?,"'Nasal packs are used when less conservative measures fail. These packs are frequently placed in both sides of the nose. The packs are usually made of a material called ""Merocel"" which is a compressed sponge-like material or a gel gauze-wrapped balloon (called a ""Rhino Rocket"") used to help compress the area of the nose that is bleeding. The doctor usually leaves them in for several days. This requires a follow-up appointment so your doctor can remove the packs.''The patient will need someone to drive them and bring them home after the nasal packs are removed. During this time, the patient may be prescribed antibiotics and ''pain'' medication as needed.''It is not uncommon for the nose to drain a blood-tinged material. Folded gauze taped under the nose (a mustache dressing) is often useful. The doctor may permit the patient to clean the nostrils with hydrogen peroxide soaked Q-tips. ''Prevention'' methods described previously should be considered to help to avoid bleeding again.''Patients with nosebleeds should not take aspirin or any other blood thinning products. If patients are already taking these medications when the nosebleed is noticed, they should notify their doctor.' "
Facts you should know about narcissistic personality disorder," Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental disorder that is characterized by an established pattern of being fixated on oneself, permeating the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the sufferer, and their relationships with other people. People with NPD tend to alternate between feeling omnipotent and devalued. Narcissistic personality disorder occurs as often as in 6% of adults, more often in men than in women. Like most mental illness, narcissistic personality disorder tends to have biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to its development. Narcissists demonstrate a pervasive pattern of the external appearance of having significantly inflated self-esteem, a need for admiration, and lack of empathy for others that begins by early adulthood and manifests in a number of different aspects of their life. While the primary treatment for narcissistic personality disorder is talk therapy rather than medication, medication may be appropriate to address some co-occurring symptoms. One of the major obstacles to a good prognosis for narcissistic individuals is their perception that other people are the cause of their problems rather than their own self-centered tendencies."
What is narcissistic personality disorder?,"'In order to understand narcissistic personality disorder, the concept of personality is important. As with normal personality, that of the person with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has a pervasive way of thinking, feeling, and interacting with other people that tends to be fairly established and fixed by the time the individual reaches adulthood. A narcissist is someone who has therefore established a long-standing pattern of being fixated on him- or herself that permeates their thoughts, feelings, actions, and relationships.''The word ''narcissism'' comes from the story of Narcissus, a ''hunter'' in Greek mythology well known for his ''beauty'' and for being completely in love with himself. His all-consuming self-love resulted in his eventual death, caused by his becoming so attracted to his own reflection in a pool that he was unable to stop staring at his image.''People with narcissism tend to interact with others and the world in general by distorting things such that they alternate between feeling omnipotent or devalued. Children of a narcissistic parent often feel like they are never good enough. Narcissistic personality disorder has an average occurrence rate of about 1% of the population occurs as often as in 6% of adults. Some research indicates that the incidence of NPD more than doubled from 1999 to 2009.''Medical professionals diagnose NPD more often in men than in women. It is also more often found in people who are involved with the court system compared to the public. ''Antisocial personality disorder'' is an illness that commonly co-occurs with narcissistic personality disorder.' "
What are causes and risk factors for narcissistic personality disorder?,"'As with most ''mental health'' disorders, narcissistic personality disorder does not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with this illness tend to have biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to its development. Biologically, narcissists have a tendency to have a smaller part of the brain that is related to having empathy for others.''Psychologically, individuals with narcissism tend to have trouble having opposing self-images of excessive admiration and devaluing in their minds and in their relationships. They are excessively emotionally sensitive.''Early psychoanalytic theory on the emotional motivations for the development of NPD focused on the relationship between mothers and sons. Specifically, medical professionals believed that men develop this disorder as the result of having an excessively close relationship with their mother that is contingent upon always doing what she wants, with a resulting paranoid fear of retaliation by their father and humiliation or abandonment by their mother. Since those early theories, the social risk factors for developing NPD have been expanded to include excessive admiration or neglect by either parent.''In addition to receiving excessive, unrealistic admiration, praise, and overindulgence, or excessive criticism for misbehavior during childhood, theories about other social risk factors of narcissistic personality disorder include emotional abuse, unpredictable parental care and parent-child interactions, as well as learning manipulation from caregivers.'  "
What are narcissistic personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'In order to be assessed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, an individual must demonstrate a pervasive pattern of significantly inflated self-esteem (grandiosity), a need to be admired and lack of empathy for others that begins by early adulthood and is present in a number of different aspects of their life. According to the ''DSM-5''/''DSM-V'' (the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition''), the diagnostic reference that is written and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association, specific symptoms and signs of this illness have remained consistent from the previous edition (''DSM-IV-Text Revision'') and include the following:''Mental health professionals describe individuals who have some ''symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder'' but not enough for the full-blown diagnosis as having narcissistic personality traits.'   An excessive sense of self-importance, with an expectation of being seen as superior for no reason Preoccupation with self-aggrandizing fantasies: unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or love Excessive belief that he or she is special or unique and therefore should only associate with other high-status people A need for excessive admiration A sense of entitlement to receiving especially favorable treatment or compliance with their wishes A tendency to take advantage of others to achieve their own ends Lacking empathy for the needs and feelings of people Frequently envious of others or thinking others are envious of him or her Exhibits haughty, arrogant thoughts or behaviors"
How do medical professionals diagnose narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Many providers of health care may help make the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, including pediatricians, primary care providers, licensed mental health therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants and social workers. As part of this examination, the sufferer will likely undergo a full physical examination and laboratory tests in an attempt to rule out any medical condition that may contribute to the symptoms described. The person with NPD may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of the illness. Given the low level of insight that narcissistic individuals have regarding their symptoms, there is a lower tendency for them to self-report symptoms. Therefore, mental health professionals may seek information from the family members as part of the assessment of people with NPD. A medical professional will conduct a thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental health symptoms such that narcissistic personality disorder can be distinguished from other personality traits or disorders like histrionic personality disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''antisocial personality disorder''. The mental health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present, since narcissism is often also associated with ''depression'"" or perfectionism. In addition to demonstrating a pattern of grandiose thoughts or behaviors, self-absorption, need for admiration, and lack of empathy for others characterized by at least five of the previously described symptoms, other diagnostic criteria for narcissistic personality disorder include the sufferer's pattern of such behaviors being pervasive throughout the person's life, as well as stable, longstanding symptoms that are not better explained by another mental illness, the effects of a substance, or a medical condition."" "
What is the treatment for narcissistic personality disorder?,"'The primary treatment for narcissistic personality disorder is talk therapy (''psychotherapy'') rather than medication. However, medication may be appropriate to address some co-occurring mental health symptoms like ''depression'', irritability, or ''anxiety'"". Psychotherapy tends to focus on how the person with the disorder interacts with the therapist during therapy, examining and changing the individual's grandiose sense of self and excessively vulnerable thinking, teaching the sufferer ways to regulate their emotions, and correcting self-centered behaviors to more healthy self-confidence and prosocial ways of interacting with others. Some studies indicate that limited reparenting of the person with NPD by the therapist may help decrease the symptoms of the disorder. That approach, referred to as schema-focused therapy, involves accessing the aspects of the person consistent with a vulnerable child then helping the person emotionally mature to thinking and behaving like a mature adult.""'Providing family members of people with pathological narcissism with therapy that teaches them about the illness of their loved one as well as ways to improve their communication and problem-solving skills helps decrease symptoms in their narcissistic loved one.'  "
What are possible complications of narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Compared to people without mental illness, people with narcissistic personality disorder are at higher risk of becoming ''depressed'', anxious, and socially isolated. They tend to have problematic relationships, as well. They are also more prone to developing cardiovascular illnesses, abusing substances, becoming aggressive, and having ''suicidal thoughts'' on a long-term basis.' "
What is the prognosis of narcissistic personality disorder?,"""How well or poorly people with narcissistic personality disorder progress over time seems to be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the person receives appropriate treatment. Simultaneously suffering from other mental health problems, like ""'major depression'', ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', or another personality disorder, is associated with a lower likelihood of symptoms of NPD being alleviated with treatment. One of the major obstacles to treatment and therefore to a good prognosis for narcissistic individuals is the perception by these individuals that their problems are caused by others rather than by their own self-centered tendencies.' "
Is it possible to prevent narcissistic personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like ''prevention'' of ''child abuse'', ''domestic violence'', and ''substance abuse'' in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems, including narcissistic personality disorder.'

What’s the difference between nummular eczema and ringworm?,"'The main difference is that ''ringworm'' is ''contagious'' and ''nummular eczema'' is not.''Ringworm'' can be seen in one or two patches, unlike ''nummular eczema'' that has multiple patches.''There will be a history of ''trauma'', ''burns'', and bites with nummular ''eczema'' and no such history with ''ringworm''.''Your dermatologist may diagnose the ''rash'' by examining your skin. Ringworm usually has few vesicles, scaly, and raised ring-like narrow borders.''However, if you have open sores within any of the ''rashes'', your dermatologist may gently scrape your skin and take a sample to test whether you have ''staph'' (bacterial) infection or ringworm.''Once your dermatologist diagnoses and treats the ''rash'', you may get better within 7-10 days. Nummular ''eczema'' takes longer to heal than ringworm. Sometimes, it may take up to a year, and it may return if not cured completely. In extreme cases, it may ''scar'' or cause the affected skin to become darker.''Ringworm heals within a week after treatment. Sometimes, it may take six weeks. Ringworm does not usually show recurrence unless you have an underlying cause such as ''diabetes'' or you sweat too much.' "
What is nummular eczema?,"'Nummular ''eczema'' is also known as discoid ''eczema'' or nummular ''dermatitis''. If you have this rash, you may get''The causes of this rash are not clear. However, you may get this eczema if you have''Skin reaction to another type of eczema:''Additionally, men are more prone to get this rash than women. Prompt diagnosis and the right treatment are very important.' Coin-shaped patches on your legs, arms, back, buttocks, foot, and hands. Extreme itching and burning lesions. Oozing and crusted scaly lesions. Dry skin. Abrasion. Trauma. Insect bite. Chemical burn. Atopic dermatitis (familial condition inflammation of the skin, especially in children). Stasis dermatitis (inflammation of the leg skin due to fluid build-up). Contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin after contact with certain substances)."
What is ringworm?,"'Ringworm is a common ''skin infection'' also known as dermatophytosis, dermatophyte infection, or ''tinea corporis''. It is not a worm infection, but it is caused by fungi (''mold'') that live in the dead tissues of our skin. It is so-called because the rash has a ring-like shape and spreads in a ring-like manner. Ringworm is highly contagious.''You may get red, ''itchy'', and scaly patches with sharp edges. These are red at the edges and have a normal looking center. Sometimes, the rash may ''blister'' and ooze. ''Scalp'' infection of ringworm is very common in children. It mainly spreads through skin-to-skin contact by sharing personal objects or even through an infected animal.\xa0''It can be commonly misdiagnosed with nummular eczema, ''tick-borne disease'' (''Lyme disease''), or ''spider bite''. Therefore, consult your dermatologist if you get ring-like patches. Ringworm may develop at the following sites on the body:''It is easily cured with antifungal medications such as ''terbinafine'', ''Sporanox'' (''itraconazole''), etc.' On your scalp In between your toes (athlete’s foot/tinea pedis) In between your skin folds of the groin region (jock’s itch/tinea cruris) Over the cheeks (barber’s itch) On your face (tinea faciei) On your hands or even nails"
How can you prevent these skin infections?,"'The best way to prevent is to:' Keep your skin dry and clean. Do not share personal items such as towels, clothes, soaps, and creams. Change your undergarments at least once a day. Wash your hands after playing with pets, especially if your pet has ringworm. Do not wear certain metal or dyed substances if you have hypersensitive skin."
When should I decide about breastfeeding?,"""Generally, it is a good idea for the new mom to meet with the baby's doctor prior to the birth in order for all to get to know each other in a controlled, non-rushed, quiet environment. This is a perfect opportunity to discuss your concerns and wishes about feeding your baby. One important reason to have the decision to breastfeed made before the delivery is that it can be very difficult or even impossible to start using formula and then later try to switch to breast milk. This is because the ability of the breasts to produce milk diminishes soon after ""'childbirth'' without the stimulation of breastfeeding.'  "
Why is the choice so important?,"""During your baby's first year of life, he/she will more than triple his/her total body weight, and the vast majority of this ""'weight gain'' will come from the milk that he/she ''drinks''. According to the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants. This includes premature and sick newborns, with rare exceptions. Of course, breast milk would appear to be the most ideal food for your ''newborn''. Breast milk is the food least likely to cause ''allergic'' reactions, it is inexpensive, it is readily available at any hour of the day or night; ''babies'' accept the taste readily; and the immunity factors in breast milk can help the baby fight off some infections.''Although breast milk is the ideal food for human infants, because of medical or other reasons, some women opt for formula feeding. ''Infant formulas'' have been developed to artificially duplicate human milk, although no formulas have been developed that are an exact replacement for human milk.' "
What are the disadvantages and benefits of breastfeeding?,"'The nutritional advantages of breast milk are certainly numerous. The amino acids in breast milk, the building blocks of proteins, are well balanced for the human baby, as are the sugars (primarily lactose) and ''fats'"". The baby's intestinal tract is best aided in its digestion by the ""'vitamins'', enzymes, and minerals found in breast milk. Breast milk also contains infection-fighting antibodies from the mother, and breastfed babies are believed to be at a reduced risk for many acute and chronic infections early in life. The ''cholesterol'' content is also high in human milk and very low in formulas. Cholesterol promotes brain growth and provides the building blocks of hormones, ''vitamin D'', and intestinal bile.''Breast milk is also the least expensive way to feed an infant. However, the mother must maintain good ''nutrition'' and continue taking any vitamin/mineral ''supplements'' her doctor recommended during the pregnancy.''Formula-fed babies may also have the risk of developing an ''allergy'' to a particular formula. When a baby develops an ''allergy'' to formula, he or she may have symptoms that include irritability, crying after feedings, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or a skin ''rash''. Concerns that your baby is having a formula ''allergy'"" should be discussed with your baby's doctor.""'Nursing helps most women ''lose weight'' (though not fluid) after delivery, as 500 calories or more are used by breastfeeding each day. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk for postpartum bleeding and a reduced risk for ovarian and ''breast cancer'' in the future.''Breastfeeding facilitates bonding between mother and baby. There is a well-accepted extra closeness that breastfeeding mothers experience that is both hormonal and emotional in nature.''The only disadvantages for the baby in breastfeeding occur when things are not going well, for example, if there\'s an inadequate supply of breast milk or an inefficient suck reflex in the baby. However, it is unusual for a mother not to produce enough milk for her baby unless she is not breastfeeding correctly or frequently enough. The disadvantages that most commonly arise involve the rest of the family. Siblings and dad sometimes feel ""left out"" of baby care since mom is the only one who can do the nursing. However, other family members can be involved in helping with different aspects of the baby\'s care, and this gives them a valuable feeling of importance and allows mom a chance to rest.''Breastfed babies eat more often than formula-fed babies since breast milk is more quickly digested and leaves the stomach empty more frequently. This puts a little more ''stress'"" on the mother because of the potential necessity for more frequent feedings. If the mother develops certain medical conditions, whether or not to continue breastfeeding may need to be reassessed. These conditions should always be discussed with the doctor. However, it is rare that breastfeeding would need to be discontinued completely. In any interaction, the mother's doctor and/or pharmacist should be informed that she is breastfeeding. Some medicines should be avoided during breastfeeding. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. If a breastfeeding mother is required to take a medication which has not been fully studied, she may want to consider discussing this matter with her doctor."" "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of formula feeding?,"""For some parents, or when the baby has certain medical conditions, it is very important to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. Foods, medications, or physical conditions in the mother are no longer a concern for the baby who is receiving formula. The entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings, allowing the mother to get more rest. Formula-fed babies actually need to eat somewhat less often since formula is less readily digested by the baby than human milk. The disadvantages of formulas are primarily their expense, the lack of maternal infection-fighting antibodies that are in breast milk, and the fact that no formula can exactly duplicate the ideal composition of breast milk."" "
"Can 
I use both forms of feedings for my baby?","""According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. Furthermore, it is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings but should receive iron-fortified ""'infant formula''.''Supplementing breastfeeding with formula is usually discouraged, although it may be helpful in cases where the mother is not producing an adequate supply of milk or the baby is not able to breastfeed well.''Lactation aids are also available as an option to avoid using a bottle when supplementation is necessary.' "
Is there any special preparation required for breastfeeding?,"'Education about the benefits and practice of breastfeeding are keys to optimal preparation. Your local hospital may offer breastfeeding classes as part of the ''childbirth'' class, or you can join your local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support group. These classes can put you in touch with a lactation specialist who may later be your personal lactation consultant. These classes can also help you to learn proper positioning and latch-on techniques.''Contrary to some popular beliefs, it is not necessary to stimulate or prepare the nipples in advance for breastfeeding. Moreover, some techniques of stimulating the nipples may actually be harmful.''No specific physical preparation is necessary for optimal breastfeeding, although some doctors may want to know about things like inverted nipples or previous breast surgery even before the baby is born. General good health measures and adequate hydration are helpful measures. Most doctors recommend continuing basic ''prenatal vitamins'' while breastfeeding.' "
When can breastfeeding begin?,"'Breastfeeding can begin within minutes after birth for most babies. Most babies take a few licks or sucks and then pause at the beginning. Frequent bursts of sucking interrupted by pauses is the usual pattern for the first few hours and sometimes even the first few days.''The first milk the mother produces, called colostrum, is the best food for a newborn. The ''nipple'' stimulation that occurs during breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract and can help stop uterine bleeding.''When a baby begins to open its eyes, look around, and put his or her fist into his or her mouth, then it is time to offer your breast. Breastfeeding experts recommend that the baby not be given ''sugar'' water or other types of bottle feedings in the hospital unless specifically prescribed by the doctor. Some experts recommend not starting a pacifier until good breastfeeding is established.' "
What is the proper technique for breastfeeding?,"'Observing other breastfeeding mothers and talking with breastfeeding support organizations can help new breastfeeding mothers learn techniques for optimal breastfeeding that can help reduce the likelihood of any discomfort or complications. These techniques are briefly outlined below.'""After the mother has assumed a position comfortable for her, she can nestle the baby in a cradle hold (cradling the baby with the mother's arm on the same side as the breast being presented). The baby's body should be on its side, so that the baby does not have to turn his or her head to reach the nipple."" First, manually express a few drops of milk to moisten the nipple. Cup the breast with your hand and using the milk-moistened nipple, gently massage baby's lips, encouraging the baby to open its mouth. When the baby's mouth is opened, the nipple is inserted into the center of the baby's mouth while pulling the baby in very close. The baby's gums should take in at least a 1-inch radius of the areola. The mother may have to make adjustments for the baby's breathing by changing the angle of baby's position slightly or using the thumb to press gently on the breast to uncover the baby's nose. Hold the breast throughout the feeding so the weight of your breast does not tire your newborn's mouth. When feeding is over, to avoid trauma to your nipples, do not pull your nipple from baby's mouth without first breaking the suction by inserting your finger into the corner of baby's mouth."
When should I use a breast pump?,"'Many women find the convenience of a breast pump to be an invaluable aid in breastfeeding. Basically, breast pumps allow the nursing mother to expel (and store, if desired) breast milk at times when she is not available to nurse the breastfed baby.''There are different types of breast pumps. Large, dual-action pumps are typically used in the hospital setting and may be rented for home use. The options for personal use and purchase include automatic models that are comparable to hospital-grade pumps, small electric or battery-operated units that double- or single-pump, and one-handed manual pumps.''Breast pumps may be useful for working mothers who wish to provide a supply of breast milk for their newborn and keep up their own milk production. Sometimes, women must stop breastfeeding on a temporary basis due to an infection or need to take certain medications. In these cases, use of a breast pump can keep milk production active during the breastfeeding hiatus.' "
Should I eliminate certain foods from my diet while breastfeeding?,"""Some babies appear to be sensitive to certain foods in the mother's ""'diet'', while other babies never appear to have negative reactions to foods. A baby may become fussy, may have trouble sleeping, or may develop ''gas'' after the mother eats certain types of foods with strong flavors. Some of the most common triggers of fussiness in babies include ''chocolate'', spices, citrus fruits, and gas-causing vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli. However, not all babies will have a reaction to particular foods.''Most experts recommend limiting consumption of ''caffeine'' while breastfeeding, since high levels of ''caffeine'"" can make the baby fussy or disturb the baby's ""'sleep'' patterns. Having more than one alcoholic beverage is also not recommended, since two or more alcoholic ''beverages'' at one time can increase blood ''alcohol'' levels to a point where the alcohol enters the breast milk. If a nursing mother consumes more than two drinks, she should wait at least 2 hours until nursing the baby to allow for elimination of alcohol from the body. If the breasts become engorged, it is fine to pump and discard breast milk while waiting. Studies have also shown that alcohol can interfere with the body\'s ability to ""let down"" (enable the free flow of breast milk) during breastfeeding.''Symptoms of allergy'' in a nursing baby may or may not be due to something eaten by the mother. If an ''allergic reaction'"" to mother's food is present in the baby, it usually develops 2-6 hours after the mother consumed the offending food.""'Because of concerns about ''mercury poisoning'', the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that nursing mothers limit their exposure to mercury in fish. The FDA and EPA advise eating no more than 6 oz. (about 1 serving) of canned albacore or ""white"" tuna a week and limiting intake of canned ""light"" tuna and other cooked fish to about 12 oz. (about 2 servings) per week. Nursing mothers should completely avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden or white snapper) because of potentially high levels of mercury.' "
Clogged milk ducts,"'Clogged milk ducts may appear as small, red, tender lumps within the breast. Milk ducts may become clogged with dried milk or other material. The goal of treatment is opening these blocked ducts. This can be aided by increasing the breastfeeding frequency and offering the affected breast first, as well as pumping the breast after breastfeeding if the baby is not emptying the breast.''Moist heat packs can be applied to the affected area to increase blood flow and healing. A warm shower and massaging of the area may also enhance resolution of this problem.''Sometimes, the baby will refuse the affected breast because the milk develops a sour taste. Pump the breast and empty it as well as possible. Continue to offer that breast to the baby until he/she accepts the affected breast again.' "
Sore nipples,"'Sore nipples can be relieved by exposing the nipples to the air as much as possible. Using a hair dryer on a low setting to dry nipples after breastfeeding may also provide relief. Nipples should be washed only with water, never with soap, alcohol, benzoin, or premoistened towelettes. Petroleum-based ointments and other cosmetic preparations should not be used, but unmedicated lanolin may help alleviate nipple cracking.' "
When should one seek medical care for problems with breastfeeding?,"'It is important to call your health care provider if the above techniques do not alleviate the problem or if you develop serious symptoms such as ''fever'' or signs of ''mastitis'' (a breast inflammation that may be caused by an infection). Symptoms of mastitis include increasing ''pain'' in the breast, ''fever'', ''chills'', sweats, ''breast swelling'' and/or hardness, and redness of the skin over the affected area. A delay in treating mastitis could lead to a more severe infection and possible breast ''abscess''.' "
Can supplements or medications increase a low milk supply?,"'Most experts agree that increasing the number of feedings and receiving coaching and assistance on proper breastfeeding technique can help increase what is perceived to be a low milk supply. Some women find that using breast pumps after each feeding stimulates milk production because of the increased degrees of emptying of the breast.''Medications that are reported to increase milk production are known as galactogogues. The most common examples are ''dopamine'' receptor antagonists (such as ''metoclopramide'' [''Reglan'', Reglan ODT, ''Metozol ODT'', Octamide] and ''domperidone''). However, there have been no data to demonstrate that these ''drugs'' are more effective than interventions that focus on improving breastfeeding technique and increasing breastfeeding frequency. Most doctors do not support the use of these medications to augment milk supply.''Although a number of ''dietary supplements'' and/or herbal preparations have been claimed to stimulate milk production, including alfalfa, ''fenugreek'', or blessed thistle, there is little scientific data to support the claims that any herbal or dietary supplement can significantly increase milk production, and safety data on the use of these ''supplements'' in nursing mothers is incomplete.' "
Is it possible to breastfeed while pregnant?,"'While breastfeeding typically is associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', it is possible to become ''pregnant'' while breastfeeding, and breastfeeding does not provide 100% effective ''birth control''. For most women, it is safe to continue breastfeeding if they desire, provided they ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition and fluid intake. While breast milk from a pregnant mother is still nutritionally strong, the hormonal changes of pregnancy will result in some changes in the content of the breast milk and the way the breast milk tastes.''Some women who have had premature ''labor'' in previous ''pregnancies'' may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they become pregnant. This is because the stimulation of the nipples that occurs during breastfeeding may trigger contractions of the uterus. In a woman prone to preterm ''labor'', these weak uterine contractions might increase her risk of developing preterm ''labor''. Both pregnancy and breastfeeding place high demands on the body in terms of nutritional support and rest. Other women may be advised to stop breastfeeding during pregnancy if their nutritional status is poor or if they are suffering from extreme ''fatigue'"" due to the pregnancy. These decisions should be made with advice from the mother's doctor."" "
Is smoking harmful when breastfeeding?,"'Tobacco smoking'' is always harmful, and all mothers should be encouraged to ''quit smoking'' prior to pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, ''smoking'' cigarettes is not considered to be a reason for not breastfeeding, since breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for newborns. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics\' policy statement on breastfeeding, ""tobacco ''smoking'' by mothers is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, but health care professionals should advise all tobacco-using mothers to avoid ''smoking'' within the home and to make every effort to wean themselves from tobacco as rapidly as possible.""''Nursing mothers should understand that ''nicotine'' is passed to the baby in breast milk, and they should never nurse their baby immediately after smoking or while smoking. Babies exposed to ''secondhand smoke'' also are at risk for a number of health issues, so if a woman smokes, she should nurse her baby after smoking, in a room away from ''cigarette'' smoke. Of course, the safest policy for both mother and baby is to abstain from tobacco use while breastfeeding and forever thereafter.' "
"Do breast implants, surgeries, or reductions affect breastfeeding?","'Strictly speaking, neither ''breast augmentation'' surgery nor ''breast reduction'"" surgery are indications that a woman should not breastfeed. However, all types of breast surgery can interfere with milk production. In women who have received implants, the location of the implant and the type of incision used in the procedure will determine the extent, if any, to which the implant may affect breast milk production or nursing ability. In some cases, operations on a woman's breast may have involved incisions in the nipple area (such as surgeries for biopsies), and in these cases, the milk ducts may have been disrupted. Surgical disruption of milk ducts and ""'scar tissue'' may also predispose women to plugged ducts, mastitis, or milk retention ''cysts'' during breastfeeding.''Concerns have been expressed in the past that the content of ''breast implants'' (particularly with silicone implants) could leak out and be absorbed into breast milk, but studies have failed to show that this is a risk. Ideally, a woman who is planning breast surgery should discuss in advance with her surgeon the risks that the procedure may pose to future breastfeeding.' "
How should one wean a baby from breastfeeding?,"'Weaning is the process of transitioning from breastfeeding to other sources of nourishment. There are no established standards on when to wean a baby, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies receive only breast milk for the first 6 months of life and a combination of solid foods and breast milk until the baby is at least 1 year old.''Sometimes babies will signal their mothers that it is time to begin weaning; they may nurse for shorter periods of time or appear indifferent, fussy, or distractible when nursing. Other babies may even be resistant to weaning even when the mother is ready. As babies begin to eat more solid foods, their consumption of breast milk may decrease, making breast engorgement less of a problem for the mother.''Weaning does not have to take place all at once. For example, a woman may choose to continue breastfeeding only in the evening, and to wean during the day. Weaning is also easier when the baby has been exposed to another source of milk, such as taking breast milk from a bottle.''No matter when weaning occurs, experts suggest that the process take place gradually. Many women wean by dropping one breastfeeding session a week. Slowing down the process can also help milk production gradually decrease, making engorgement less of a problem. Some mothers prefer to leave the weaning process up to the child; when a child is eating solid foods at every meal, there is often a decreased interest in breastfeeding.' "
What is nature vs. nurture (definitions)?,"'In the context of the nature vs. nurture debate, “nature” refers to biological/genetic predispositions’ impact on human traits, and nurture describes the influence of learning and other influences from one’s environment. The debate over whether the strengths and weaknesses of people are the result of nature or nurture has, and somewhat continues to rage on between scholars and lay people alike. This debate has had significant social implications, particularly concerning what are thought to determine people’s ability to learn/intelligence (Lynch, 2016).' "
What is the nature vs. nurture? Who created the theory?,"'The initial use of the Nature vs. Nurture Theory was credited to psychologist Sir Francis Galton in 1869 (Bynum, 2002). However, it is unclear who initially described the impact of genes and biology versus environmental influences. Scientists, doctors, researchers, psychologists, behaviorists, and many others have debated these theories since Hippocrates was alive.''Around 400 B.C.E., Hippocrates described human behaviors as being biological, the result of four different body fluid types called humors.''In contrast, many centuries later, philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke independently thought that people are born as blank slates (i.e. ""tabula rasa""), and that their eventual individual differences develop solely due to the result of environmental influences (Psychology Encyclopedia, 2017; Duschinsky, 2012; Nesterak, 2015). Twentieth century behavioral psychologist John Watson shared a similar perspective, believing that the events that take place during early childhood have far more influence on what kind of adults we become compared to the effects of our genes (Haggbloom et al, 2002).'

How does nature vs. nurture affect our genes?,'Most conventional theories of nature vs. nurture consider the differences in humans a result of elements of both your genetic ''makeup'' and your environment.' 
What are examples of nature vs. nurture?,"'While certain physical traits like skin and eye color and diseases like ''sickle cell anemia'' and Huntington’s chorea have been found to be the result of direct genetic inheritance, virtually any pattern of thinking or behavior can be understood from the perspective of a combination of nature and nurture. In the animal kingdom, domestication of many species is understood to be the result of encouraging domesticated behaviors (nurture), then having animals that most successfully adopt those behaviors breed with each other so it becomes part of their nature (Bouchard, 1994).''In humans, many studies in more than the past 20 years involve identical or fraternal twins who are separated at birth. The question of nature vs. nurture somewhat continues to be debated concerning human behavior, intelligence, and in the development of personality traits (Psychology Encyclopedia, 2017).' "
How does nature vs. nurture affect our mental and physical health?,"'It is understood that certain physical traits, as well as the susceptibility to most physical and ''mental health'' disorders tend to run in families. Specifically, whatever illnesses your parents, grandparents, siblings, and other biological family members have does not guarantee you will inherit them, but it does increase the likelihood that you may develop them.''On the other hand, it is understood that environmental factors often have a significant effect on whether or not you develop the health problems that run in your family. (You can change your gene expressions).''A couple of examples of how the ''environment (nurture) can provide a benefit'', and possibly decrease your risk in getting an illness from your family are:' If you are at risk for heart disease or diabetes, eat a healthy diet and exercise. If you are at risk for other conditions, for example, breast or colon cancer, get regular health screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies per your doctor's recommendations. Exposure to community violence increasing the likelihood of anxiety Depression and negative behaviors Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke may develop cancers more often than those who do not have that experience (Nesterak, 2015)."
Is our intelligence based on nature or nurture?,"'As with most human traits, intelligence is now understood to be the result of some combination of both nature and nurture. While genes have a great influence on the size and biochemistry of the brain, its full development does not usually occur until after the first 20 years of life. Also, the heredity of intelligence tends to vary between different aspects of cognition.''Intelligence and subsequent learning also are viewed as being largely molded by the environment the person grows up in, both before and after birth. (European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2007; Kan et al, 2013). Therefore, to reduce your risk of inheriting diseases or illness from your family (or passing them on to your children):' Eat a healthy diet. If you are pregnant, don't drink alcohol or use other illegal drugs. Check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure that any current drugs or supplements you are taking will not harm your baby. It is imperative to have safe communities and schools that nurture learning and confidence for all children so that the quest can continue to promote high cognitive development in each child."
